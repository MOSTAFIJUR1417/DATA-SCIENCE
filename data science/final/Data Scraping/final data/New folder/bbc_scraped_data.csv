The 24-year-old is being questioned in Middlesbrough in connection with offences including blackmail and money laundering. Cleveland Police said it had been working for three years on ""one of the biggest investigations into computer misuse and fraud"" it had ever been involved in. The force said the Joker OTP (one time password) bot platform was believed to have been used more than 28,000 times, across 13 countries, over the last two years. Police in The Netherlands have also arrested a 30-year-old man as part of the investigation, which has been led by Cleveland Police's Cyber Crime Unit. It involves a tool that is alleged to have been designed to convince victims to provide authentication codes and other personal information, which could be used to execute fraudulent bank transactions, the force said. Det Sgt Kevin Carter said: ""The team has been working closely with various law enforcement agencies to establish what activity has taken place, the number of victims believed to have been affected, and the identity of the individuals suspected of being involved. ""Users of the Joker OTP bot platform can rest assured that law enforcement has been watching and will be in touch."" Follow BBC Tees on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram. "

Two officers shot at the man around 07:00 local time (11:00 GMT), Ontario police's Special Investigations Unit (SIU), said in a statement.  No police officers were injured, and ""there is no known threat to the public"", according to the SIU, which is tasked with investigating incidents involving police shootings. Authorities say that the shooting happened after they were called to a ""dispute"". After several minutes of de-escalation attempts, the man pulled out a gun and police opened fire.  On Thursday morning, Peel Regional Police officers were investigating a ""man in distress"" in an SUV at Terminal 1 departures, the SIU said. Authorities said the incident happened near Terminal 1 departures.  Peel Regional Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah said officers spent about 10 minutes speaking to the group, which included two or three people who were in a dispute.  After ""an immense amount of de-escalation"", one of the individuals ""abruptly"" withdrew a gun, the chief said. Officers opened fire on the man.  The man - who police have not named - was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The incident temporarily sparked travel chaos at Canada's busiest airport.  Police confirmed there were temporary road closures around the terminal, but airport authorities told the BBC that flights ""continue to operate normally"". Ontario Provincial Police advised drivers and commuters to ""avoid the area"". Buses to the airport initially were rerouted, but Toronto's public transit authority has confirmed that normal service has resumed.  Ontario Premier Doug Ford condemned the shooting.  ""What's the world coming to? You go to the airport and there's shootings happening,"" he said, according to CBC News. Pearson airport is 20km (12 miles) away from Toronto in the city of Mississauga. It is  the country's busiest airport and sees more than 40 million passengers each year.  This not the first time it has made headlines this year. In February, a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis overturned at Pearson and caught fire after skidding along the runway. All 80 passengers survived."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgkg85lr0r4o",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wales international Megan Wynne has promised to ""get through, just like I did before"" as she faces up to the second knee surgery of her career. The 32-year-old forward has confirmed she suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in Perth Glory's final game of the season on Friday. Wynne joined the A-League side on a two-year contract in August 2024 after being released by Southampton, starting in 19 of the Australian side's 23 games this season. ""It's hard to find the words right now, but I do know this wasn't how the last game of the season was supposed to go,"" Wynne posted on her social media account. ""Nothing can take away from what an amazing experience this season has been.  ""I feel very proud & lucky to have played my first season in the A-League, with this group of people/players, in a place that has now become my home away from home."" Wynne, who has not added to her 24 Wales caps since a 2-0 friendly defeat against the USA in July 2023, suffered a similar injury in August 2020. She tore her ACL just weeks after joining Bristol City from Tottenham Hotspur, finally making her first appearance for the west country club in May 2021. The Hertfordshire-born player now looks set for further surgery and another long spell on the sidelines as Rhian Wilkinson's Wales continue their preparations for this summer's Euros in Switzerland. ""It's a long, tough road ahead, but one I know I will get through, just like I did before,"" she added. "

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly6lp567r8o","His memories uncovered a secret jail - right next to an international airport",2025-04-15,"Samira Hussain","BBC News","When investigators smashed through a hastily built wall, they uncovered a set of secret jail cells. It turned out to be a freshly bricked-up doorway – an attempt to hide what lurked behind. Inside, off a narrow hallway, were tiny rooms to the right and left. It was pitch-black. The team may never have found this clandestine jail – a stone's throw from Dhaka's International Airport – without the recollections of Mir Ahmad Bin Quasem and others. A critic of Bangladesh's ousted leader, he was held there for eight years. He was blindfolded for much of his time in the prison, so he leaned on the sounds he could recall - and he distinctly remembered the sound of planes landing. That was what helped lead investigators to the military base near the airport. Behind the main building on the compound, they found the smaller, heavily guarded, windowless structure made of brick and concrete where detainees were kept. It was hidden in plain sight. Investigators have spoken to hundreds of victims like Quasem since mass protests toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed's government last August, and inmates in the jails were released. Many others are alleged to have been killed unlawfully. The people running the secret prisons, including the one over the road from Dhaka airport, were largely from an elite counter-terrorism unit, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), acting on orders directly from Hasina, investigators say. ""The officers concerned [said] all the enforced disappearance cases have been done with the approval, permission or order by the prime minister herself,"" Tajul Islam, the chief prosecutor for the International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh, told the BBC. Hasina's party says the alleged crimes were carried out without its knowledge, that it bears no responsibility and that the military establishment operated alone - a charge the army rejects. Seven months on, Quasem and others may have been released, but they remain terrified of their captors, who are serving security force members and are all still free. Quasem says he never leaves home without wearing a hat and mask. ""I always have to watch my back when I'm travelling."" He slowly walks up a flight of concrete steps to show the BBC where he was kept. Pushing through a heavy metal door, he bends his head low and goes through another narrow doorway into ""his"" room, the cell where he was held for eight years. ""It felt like being buried alive, being totally cut off from the outside world,"" he tells the BBC. There were no windows and no doors to natural light. When he was inside, he couldn't tell between day or night. Quasem, a lawyer in his 40s, has done interviews before but this is the first time he has taken the media for a detailed look inside the tiny cell where he was held. Viewed by torchlight, it is so small an average-sized person would have difficulty standing up straight. It smells musty. Some of the walls are broken and bits of brick and concrete lie strewn on the ground - a last-ditch attempt by perpetrators to destroy any evidence of their crimes. ""[This] is one detention centre. We have found that more than 500, 600, 700 cells are there all through the country. This shows that this was widespread and systematic,"" says Islam, the prosecutor, who accompanied the BBC on the visit to the jail. Quasem also clearly remembers the faint blue tiles from his cell, now lying in pieces on the floor, which led investigators to this particular room. In comparison to the cells on the ground floor, this one is much larger, at 10ft x 14ft (3m x 4.3m). There is a squatting toilet off to one side. In painful detail, Quasem walks around the room, describing how he spent his time during his years in captivity. During the summers, it was unbearably hot. He would crouch on the floor and put his face as close to the base of the doorway as he could, to get some air. ""It felt worse than death,"" he says. Coming back to relive his punishment seems cruel. But Quasem believes it is important for the world to see what was done. ""The high officials, the top brass who aided and abetted, facilitated the fascist regime are still in their position,"" he says. ""We need to get our story out, and do whatever we can to ensure justice for those who didn't return, and to help those who are surviving to rehabilitate into life."" Previous reports said he was kept inside a notorious detention facility - known as Aynaghor, or ""House of Mirrors"" - inside the main intelligence headquarters in Dhaka, but investigators now believe there were many such sites. Quasem told the BBC he spent all his detention at the RAB base, apart from the first 16 days. Investigators now suspect the first site was a detective branch of police in Dhaka.  He believes he was disappeared because of his family's politics. In 2016 he'd been representing his father, a senior member of the country's largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, who was on trial and later hanged. Five other men the BBC spoke to described being taken away, blindfolded and handcuffed, kept in dark concrete cells with no access to the outside world. In many cases they say they were beaten and tortured. While the BBC cannot independently verify their stories, almost all say they are petrified that one day, they might bump into a captor on the street or on a bus. ""Now, whenever I get into a car or I'm alone at home, I feel scared thinking about where I was,"" Atikur Rahman Rasel, 35, says. ""I wonder how I survived, whether I was really supposed to survive. He says his nose was broken and his hand is still painful. ""They put handcuffs on me and beat me a lot.""  Rasel says he was approached by a group of men outside a mosque in Dhaka's old city last July, as anti-government protests raged. They said they were from law enforcement and he had to go with them. The next minute, he was taken into a grey car, handcuffed, hooded and blindfolded. Forty minutes later, he was pulled out of the car, taken into a building and put in a room. ""After about half an hour, people started coming in one by one and asking questions. Who are you? What do you do?"" Then the beatings started, he says. ""Being inside that place was terrifying. I felt like I would never get out."" Rasel now lives with his sister and her husband. Sitting on a dining chair in her flat in Dhaka, he describes his weeks in captivity in detail. He speaks with little emotion, seemingly detached from his experience. He too believes his detention was politically motivated because he was a student leader with the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), of which his father was a senior member. His brother, who lived abroad, would frequently write social media posts critical of Hasina. Rasel says there was no way of knowing where he was held. But after watching interim leader Muhammad Yunus visiting three detention centres earlier this year, he thinks he was kept in Agargaon district in Dhaka. It was an open secret that Hasina had no tolerance for political dissent. Criticising her could get you ""disappeared"" without a trace, former detainees, opponents and investigators say. But the total number of people who went missing may never become clear. A Bangladeshi NGO that has tracked enforced disappearances since 2009 has documented at least 709 people who were forcibly disappeared. Among them, 155 people remain missing. Since the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances was created in September, they have received more than 1,676 complaints from alleged victims and more people continue to come forward. But that doesn't represent the total number, which is believed to be much higher. It is through speaking to people like Quasem that Tajul Islam is able to build a case against those responsible for the detention centres, including Sheikh Hasina. Despite being held at different sites, the narrative of victims is eerily similar. Mohammad Ali Arafat, spokesperson for Hasina's Awami League party, denies any involvement. He says if people were forcibly disappeared, it was not done under the direction of Hasina  - who remains in India, where she fled - or anyone in her cabinet. ""If any such detention did occur, it would have been a product of complex internal military dynamics,""  said Arafat. ""I see [no] political benefit for the Awami League or for the government to keep these people in secret detention."" The military's chief spokesman said it ""has no knowledge of the things being implied"". ""The army categorically denies operating any such detention centres,"" Lt Col Abdullah Ibn Zaid told the BBC.  Tajul Islam believes the people held in these prisons are evidence of Awami League involvement. ""All the people who were detained here were from different political identities and they just raised their voice against the previous regime, the government of that time, and that is why they were brought here."" To date they have issued 122 arrest warrants, but no one has yet been brought to justice. Which is why victims like Iqbal Chowdhury, 71, believe their lives are still in danger. Chowdhury wants to leave Bangladesh. For years after he was released in 2019, he didn't leave his house, not even to go to the market. Chowdhury was warned by his captors never to speak of his detention. ""If you ever reveal where you were or what happened, and if you are taken again, no one will ever find or see you again. You will be vanished from this world,"" he says he was told. Accused of writing propaganda against India and the Awami League, Chowdhury says that is why he was tortured. ""I was physically assaulted with an electric shock as well as being beaten. Now one of my fingers is heavily damaged by the electric shock. I lost my leg's strength, lost physical strength."" He remembers the sound of others being physically tortured, grown men howling and crying in agony. ""I am still scared,"" says Chowdhury. Rahmatullah, 23, is also terrified. ""They took away a year and a half of my life. Those times won't ever be returned,"" he says. ""They made me sleep in a place where a human being should not even be."" On 29 August 2023, he was taken from his home at midnight by RAB officers, some in uniform and others dressed in plain clothes. He was working as a cook in a neighbouring town while training to be an electrician. After repeated interrogations, it became clear to Rahmatullah he was being forcibly detained for his anti-India and Islamic posts on social media. Using a pen and paper, he draws the layout of his cell, including the open drain he would use to relieve himself. ""Even thinking about that place in Dhaka makes me feel horrible. There was no space to lie down properly, so I had to sleep being curled up. I couldn't stretch my legs while lying down.""  The BBC also interviewed two other former detainees – Michael Chakma and Masrur Anwar – to corroborate some of the details about the secret prisons and what is alleged to have gone on inside them. Some of the victims live with physical scars from their detentions. All of them talk about the psychological torment that follows them everywhere they go. Bangladesh is at a pivotal moment in its history as it tries to rebuild after years of autocratic rule. A crucial test of the country's progress towards democracy will be its ability to hold a fair trial for the perpetrators of these crimes. Islam believes it can, and must happen. ""We must stop the recurrence of this type of offence for our future generations. And we have to do justice for the victims. They suffered a lot."" Standing in what remains of his concrete cell, Quasem says a trial must take place as soon as possible so the country can close this chapter. It's not so simple for Rahmatullah. ""The fear has not gone away. The fear will remain until I die."""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg411rrnkkko","Why has Trump revoked hundreds of international student visas?",2025-04-09,"Brandon Drenon","BBC News","The Trump administration has revoked visas of hundreds of international students and detained roughly a dozen others on college campuses across the US, often without any warning or recourse for appeals. Videos of some of the arrests, showing plain-clothes officers handcuff and arrest students near their homes, have gone viral and sent shockwaves through the international student community. Over 80 universities have reported revoked visas, according to a tracker by Inside Higher Ed, hitting students and faculty from coast-to-coast.  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed last month that at least 300 visas have been revoked, adding that the department was targeting those who were involved in activities that ""run counter"" to US national interests.  Many of those targeted have participated in some form of pro-Palestinian activity. In other cases, cancellations appear to be connected to those with some sort of  criminal record, or legal infractions like driving over the speed limit, immigration lawyers have said.  Immigration experts say visa-holding students have the same First Amendment right to free speech as US citizens, and historically it has been rare for students to be deported because of acts of political expression. But they are vulnerable to deportation because of the temporary nature of their visa. Lawyers for some of the students who have filed lawsuits against the federal government say their visas were revoked suddenly, without any warning and without recourse for appeal or corrections.  Rubio has said that student visas are for studying and warned they would be revoked if foreigners were seen as engaging in ""destabilizing"" acts. In a transcript released by the US State Department, Rubio said ""it might be more"" than 300 visas that have been revoked.  ""I don't know actually if it's primarily student visas. It's a combination of visas,"" he told reporters. Those affected have predominantly been involved in pro-Palestinian protests, he said, but have also included some who have prior criminal charges.  A Turkish citizen and University of Minnesota student was detained in March after his visa was revoked for a prior drunk driving infraction, according to the BBC's media partner CBS News. Other reports show students have had their visas revoked after they were found to have prior speeding tickets.  Faculty members and rights advocates have expressed concern about students' ability to share their opinions without risking their legal status. ""No president should be allowed to set an ideological litmus test and exclude or remove people from our country who they disagree with,"" the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a statement. The White House has defended its actions using a provision of a 1952 law that grants the secretary of state broad authority to expel foreigners believed to pose ""potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences"" for the US. Inside Higher Ed tracker identifies more than 80 colleges and universities where international students and recent graduates have had their legal status changed by the State Department. It lists major public universities with tens-of-thousands of students like Texas A&M University, University of Oregon, University of Florida and University of Colorado. It also includes smaller private institutions like Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University and Stanford University.  Federal authorities revoked visas of at least eight students at Arizona State University and at least six people at the University of California Berkeley, according to the Washington Post. At least 57 visas have been revoked from across the entire University of California system, according to the Wall Street Journal, and seven at Ohio State University. There are roughly 1.1 million international student visa-holders in the US.  Multiple students and faculty have been detained, including those on student visas and at least one permanent legal US resident.  Once in custody, they have been sent to detention centres across the US where they await deportation.  Video footage of some of the arrests shows plain-clothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers approaching confused and frightened students, before they are placed in the back of unmarked cars. Some of those detained have alleged they were arrested without explanation and say they have committed no crimes.  One of the most high profile cases involves Mahmoud Khalil, a recent Columbia University graduate and legal permanent resident who was arrested in his university-owned home in March.  The other case to capture national attention involves Tufts University student and Turkish national Rumeysa Ozturk. Footage of Ms Ozturk's detainment shows her shaking in fear as she is encircled by six plain-clothes ICE agents wearing masks who stopped her on the street as she was headed to a Ramadan celebration.  Rasha Alawieh, a Brown University professor and kidney transplant specialist, was deported after arriving at Boston airport.  US officials said they found ""photos and videos"" on her cell phone that were ""sympathetic"" to Hezbollah. At least two students who had their visas revoked have fled to Canada, including Momodou Taal and Ranjani Srinivasan. Several students have sued the government to challenge their visa revocations and detainment amid a bid to delay or block their deportation.  They allege that they have been arrested and detained without cause or explanation, a possible violation of their civil rights.  One example includes Xiaotian Liu, a 26-year-old doctoral student from China who studies at Dartmouth College. Mr Liu is suing the government along with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, alleging that his visa has been revoked ""without any notice and sufficient explanation"". Mr Liu has not committed any crimes or participated in any protests, according to the lawsuit. "

The marathon, which was launched in 1981, took place annually in April to celebrate the birth of its founding leader Kim Il Sung. Before Sunday's marathon, the race was last held in 2019, wherein 950 foreigners participated. North Korea sealed itself off the following year, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. North Korea has been slow to reopen since, allowing only Russian tourists into its capital since last year. Runners have had to enter the country as part of an organised tour group, as was the case before the pandemic. Koryo Tours, a Beijing-based travel agency listed as an ""exclusive partner"" on the event website, offers six-day marathon tours at 2,195 euros ($2,406) including flights to and from Beijing.  ""The Pyongyang Marathon is an extremely unique experience as it provides an opportunity to interact with locals,"" the agency wrote on its website. Sunday's marathon route took participants past landmarks across the city, including the Kim Il Sung stadium, the Arch of Triumph built to commemorate Kim Il Sung's role in resisting Japanese rule, and the Mirae Future Scientists' Street said to be a residential district for scientists and engineers.  Pictures online show the stadium - where runners start and finish their race - filled with spectators, many of them cheering and waving gold-coloured paper flags. Pak Kum Dong, a North Korean runner, told Reuters news agency: ""The eyes of our people on me helped me to bear the difficulties whenever I feel tired."" There is no publicly available information on race results. North Korea had only started to scale back Covid-19 restrictions in the middle of 2023.  In Feburary, it allowed some Western tourists into the remote, eastern city Rason, but suspended those tours just weeks after. "

""The Prime Minister will always act in Britain's national interest - for workers, for business, for families,"" a No10 spokesperson said. The UK government has been seeking an agreement to lower tariffs since President Donald Trump imposed them on almost every country in the world last month. President Trump appeared to allude to the agreement when he posted on social media on Wednesday night, saying he would announced a ""major trade deal"" with a ""highly respected country"".  On 2 April, Trump announced steep tariffs on dozens of trading partners, before announcing a 90-day pause on the levies. Governments from around the world have been scrambling to strike deals with Washington before the new deadline passes. The US has left a 10% global tariff in place, which included the UK, though the long-time ally of America was not subject to the administration's higher ""reciprocal"" tariffs. The UK is also subject to a 25% US import tax on steel, aluminium and cars. Washington is close to agreeing trade deals with India and Israel, according to reports.  The administration is also continuing talks with several other countries including Japan, South Korea and Vietnam.  Trump has said he wants nations to strike new deals with the US as he tries to radically reshape the global trading system. This week the US and China announced that their top trade officials will start talks to try to de-escalate a dispute between the world's two biggest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks in Switzerland from 9 to 12 May, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer will represent Washington at the meeting, their offices announced. Since returning to the White House, Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods of up to 145%. Beijing has hit back with levies on some goods from the US of 125%. It will be the first high-level interaction between the two countries since Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng attended Trump's inauguration in January. But global trade experts have told the BBC that they expect negotiations to take several months. Seperately, the UK and India agreed to a trade deal earlier this week which will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports."

A senior official in Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government confirmed this hours after Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who is sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in Hungary for a state visit.  Orban had invited Netanyahu as soon as the warrant was issued last November, saying the ruling would have ""no effect"" in his country. In November, ICC judges said there were ""reasonable grounds"" that Netanyahu bore ""criminal responsibility"" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned the ICC's decision as ""antisemitic"". The ICC, a global court, has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Hungary is a founding member of the ICC, which counts 125 member states, and will be the first European Union nation to pull out of it. A withdrawal has no impact on ongoing proceedings.  During a joint press conference, Orban asserted that the ICC had become a ""political court"". He added the court's decision to issue a warrant against the Israeli leader ""clearly showed"" this.  Netanyahu meanwhile hailed Hungary's ""bold and principled"" decision to withdraw from the court.  ""It's important for all democracies. It's important to stand up to this corrupt organisation,"" Netanyahu said. A statement from the Israeli prime minister's office on Thursday said Netanyahu and Orban had spoken with US President Donald Trump about the decision and the ""next steps that can be taken on this issue"". Earlier Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar thanked Orban on X for his ""clear and strong moral stance alongside Israel"". ""The so-called International Criminal Court lost its moral authority after trampling the fundamental principles of international law in its zest for harming Israel's right to self-defence,"" Sa'ar added. Hungary's decision aligns with its broader foreign policy stance under Orban, who has cultivated close ties with Israel and adopted a critical view of international institutions perceived as infringing on national sovereignty. While Hungary's withdrawal may carry symbolic weight and political implications, it does not significantly alter the ICC's operational capacity or legal framework.  The court has faced similar challenges in the past and continues to function with broad international support. But Hungary's criticism of the ICC as ""politically biased"" and its decision to withdraw as Netanyahu visits may set a precedent for other nations to question or abandon their commitments to international justice based on political alliances or disagreements with specific rulings. The US, Russia, China and North Korea are among the nations that are not part of the ICC, and therefore do not recognise its jurisdiction. Israel is also not part of the treaty, but the ICC ruled in 2021 that it did have jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, because the UN's Secretary General had accepted that Palestinians were a member. Hungary now needs to send written notification to the UN Secretary General to leave the treaty, with the withdrawal taking effect one year later, according to article 127 of the Rome Statute, which established the ICC. ICC spokesman Fadi El-Abdullah told the BBC: ""On the visit of Mr Netanyahu, the court has followed its standard procedures, after the issuance of an arrest warrant. The court recalls that Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the ICC."" Since the warrant was issued, Hungarian authorities should technically arrest Netanyahu and hand him over to the court in the Hague, although member states do not always choose to enforce ICC warrants. In Europe, some ICC member states said they would arrest the Israeli leader if he set foot in their country, while others, including Germany, announced that Netanyahu would not be detained if he visited. But Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Thursday Hungary's announcement was ""a bad day for international criminal law"". ""Europe has clear rules that apply to all EU member states, and that is the Rome Statute. I have made it clear time and again that no one in Europe is above the law and that applies to all areas of law,"" she added.  On the other side of the Atlantic, the US has condemned the ICC's decision to issue warrants for Netanyahu's arrest and he has visited the country since it was issued in November. His visit to Hungary marks Netanyahu's first trip to Europe since then. Hungarian Defence Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky, greeted Netanyahu on the tarmac of Budapest airport on Wednesday night, welcoming him to the country. Israel is appealing against the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and strongly rejects the accusations. It both denies the authority of the ICC and the legitimacy of the warrants. Netanyahu said at the time that it was a ""dark day in the history of humanity"", and that the ICC had become ""the enemy of humanity"". ""It's an antisemitic step that has one goal - to deter me, to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us,"" he said. In the same ruling, ICC judges also issued a warrant against Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, who Israel says is dead. Hamas also rejected the allegations. The visit comes as Israel announced it was expanding its Gaza offensive and establishing a new military corridor to put pressure on Hamas, as deadly Israeli strikes continued across the Palestinian territory. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed some 1,200 people and led to 251 hostages being taken to Gaza. Since then, Israeli military attacks have killed more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say."

""People choose hotels for their services. People choose Airbnbs for the space... now, we're giving you the best of both worlds"", the company's chief executive Brian Chesky said in a statement.  It comes just weeks after the firm signalled bookings may slow in the US as President Trump's unpredictable trade policies hit consumer sentiment. Despite hosting more than two billion guests since its launch in 2008, Airbnb has also faced challenges in recent years with some cities moving to ban short lets. Airbnb's new services will initially be available in 260 cities, with the company saying they will cost from below $50 (£37.57). The luxury offerings, which include spa treatments, photographers and makeup artists, can also be booked by people who are not staying in Airbnbs.  The company's revamped app also includes an updated experiences tab, allowing users to book bespoke tours and activities. That service was first launched in 2016.  The new hotel-like features reflect the changing needs of tourists, Gary Bowerman, director of travel marketing firm Check-in Asia told the BBC. ""Travellers are now thinking much more about how to customise the trip for themselves, not just the actual functional parts of how they get there and where they stay."" Another feature of the new app is an originals tab, which offers exclusive experiences across the world. This includes playing beach volleyball in Rio de Janeiro with Olympian Carol Solberg or spending a Sunday with National Football League superstar Patrick Mahomes. Bespoke options like this are part of a wider trend as tourists seek out off-the-beaten path experiences, said luxury travel consultant Anastasia Oriordan.  ""There are so many people that have travelled and done so many things, that the benchmark or the goalpost for unique experiences is constantly moving."""

Pegasus is malicious software which can be installed remotely on mobile phones to access, among other things, people's microphones and cameras. NSO Group, which sells the tech, has been accused of enabling authoritarian regimes to monitor journalists, activists and even political figures.  WhatsApp owner Meta said it marked the ""first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware"". NSO said it would ""carefully examine the verdict's details and pursue appropriate legal remedies, including further proceedings and an appeal“. It is the first time a developer of spyware has been held responsible for exploiting the weaknesses in smartphone platforms. NSO Group says the tech is only meant to be for use against serious criminals and terrorists. But there are accusations the tech has been used by some countries to target anyone they deem a national security threat. Pegasus became a scandal in 2021 when a list of 50,000 phone numbers of suspected victims of hacking was leaked to major media outlets. From this list, global media identified the phone numbers of politicians and heads of state, business executives, activists, and several Arab royal family members, as well as more than 180 journalists. It is suspected that Pegasus spyware infected devices belonging to Downing Street and Foreign Office officials, according to Canadian investigative group The Citizen Lab. Other prominent figures believed to have been hacked include French President Emmanuel Macron, and relations of Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Arabia's government who was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. NSO Group has also been ordered to pay Meta $444,000 in damages. The awards come after after a six-year battle between the US social media giant and the Israeli surveillance firm. ""The jury's decision to force NSO to pay damages is a critical deterrent to this malicious industry against their illegal acts aimed at American companies,"" Meta said. ""We firmly believe that our technology plays a critical role in preventing serious crime and terrorism and is deployed responsibly by authorised government agencies,"" NSO said in a statement. WhatsApp's success in the case opens up NSO to potential legal action from other technology giants whose platforms were targeted with Pegasus spyware."

Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks in Switzerland from 9 to 12 May, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer will represent Washington at the meeting, their offices announced. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods of up to 145%. Beijing has hit back with levies on some goods from the US of 125%. But global trade experts have told the BBC that they expect negotiations to take several months. It will be the first high-level interaction between the two countries since Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng attended Trump's inauguration in January. Mr Bessent said he looked forward to rebalancing the international economic system to better serve the interests of the US.  ""My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal, but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,"" he said in an interview with Fox News. ""If the United States wants to resolve the issue through negotiations, it must face up to the serious negative impact of unilateral tariff measures on itself and the world,"" a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday morning. Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses.  The report added that China is open to talks but reiterated that if the country decides to continue to fight this trade war – it will fight to the end. The trade war has triggered turmoil in financial markets and sent shockwaves across global trade.  Two trade experts told the BBC that they were not particularly optimistic about the talks, at least in the initial phase. ""You have to start somewhere, so I'm not saying it isn't worthwhile. Just unlikely to be the launch event people are hoping to see,"" said Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation. ""We should expect to see a lot of back and forth, just like what happened last time in 2018,"" Henry Gao, Professor of Law at Singapore Management University and a former Chinese lawyer on the World Trade Organization secretariat said. ""I would expect the talks to drag on for several months or even more than a year"". Financial markets in mainland China and Hong Kong rose on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news as well as  announcements by Chinese authorities of measures to support the economy. US stock futures were also higher. Futures are contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date and are an indication of how markets will trade when they open.

The new tariffs on small packages worth up to $800 (£606) have been cut from 120% to 54%, according to a White House statement. The flat fee per parcel will remain at $100, while a $200 charge due to apply from 1 June has been cancelled. Chinese online retail giants Shein and Temu had previously relied on the so-called ""de minimis"" exemption to ship low-value items directly to customers in the US without having to pay duties or import taxes. Neither Shein or Temu immediately responded to BBC requests for comment. The duty-free rule was closed by the Trump administration earlier this month. Some shoppers told the BBC that they rushed through purchases ahead of that deadline. The latest rates came after the US and China released a joint statement announcing they would temporarily reduce their tit-for-tat tariffs and start a new round of trade negotiations. Share markets jumped on Monday after Trump said weekend talks had resulted in a ""total reset"" in trade terms between the two countries, a move that went some way to ease concerns about a trade war between the two countries. Under the agreement, the US will lower those tariffs from 145% to 30%, while China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods will drop to 10% from 125%. Trump told reporters, that, as some of the levies have been suspended rather than cancelled altogether, they might rise again in three months time, if no further progress was made. But the president said he did not expect them to return to the previous 145% peak. ""We're not looking to hurt China,"" Trump said after the agreement was announced, adding that China was ""being hurt very badly"". Trump added that he expected to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping ""maybe at the end of the week""."

Karim Khan will take leave until the end of the external investigation, which began late last year, and his deputy prosecutors will run the office in his absence, the ICC said in a statement. Previous media reports cited a document outlining accusations against Mr Khan, understood to include unwanted sexual touching and ""abuse"". Mr Khan has denied the allegations, which were reported to the court's governing body in October last year.  Several organisations and ICC staff members had previously called for Mr Khan to step down during the investigation. It is unknown when the external investigation - led by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services - will come to an end. An anonymous source told Reuters news agency that Mr Khan spoke to UN investigators last week for a final interview as part of the process. Reuters reported that it had seen a letter Mr Khan sent to his staff confirming his temporary leave, and in which the prosecutor said his position had been kept under constant review. ""My decision is driven by deep and unwavering commitment to the credibility of our Office and the Court, and to safeguard the integrity of the process and fairness to all involved,"" he reportedly said in the letter. Shortly after the allegations came to light last year, Mr Khan asked the ICC's watchdog, the Independent Oversight Mechanism (IOM), to conduct an internal investigation into the claims. The court's governing body later decided to pursue it externally to ""ensure a fully independent, impartial and fair process,"" its president said. The investigation comes during intense scrutiny of the ICC and Mr Khan after his request for arrest warrants linked to the Israel-Hamas war - including for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza. Israel is not an ICC member and its government, along with Netanyahu, strongly rejected the accusations. In February this year, US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on ICC officials while Netanyahu visited Washington DC. The ICC said the US sanctions have put the court itself at risk and called on its member states and global civil society to ""stand united for justice and fundamental human rights""."

The move, which is part of his strategy to win back customers, comes as other food and drink chains increasingly adopt technology to cut costs.  Also on Tuesday, the firm announced worse-than-expected financial results as its sales continue to fall. Mr Niccol was brought into Starbucks last year tasked with turning the business around as it struggles with rising prices and consumers cut back spending. ""Over the last couple of years, we've actually been removing labour from the stores. I think with the hope that equipment could offset the removal of the labour,"" Mr Niccol said during a call with investors. ""What we're finding is... that wasn't an accurate assumption with what played out."" Increasing staff numbers was tested in a handful of stores around the time Mr Niccol joined the firm in September 2024. He has been expanding the approach to include around 3,000 stores this year. At the same time the firm said it will pull back from deploying its Siren Craft System. Named after the iconic Starbucks logo, it is a suite of technology and equipment that was introduced in 2022 to streamline drink-making. Mr Niccol highlighted that taking on more staff would mean higher costs but said he was ""banking on some growth to come with the investment"". Alongside recruiting more baristas, Starbucks is also revamping its coffee shops, menus and the company's dress code. Starbucks said in April that its baristas would wear dark, single coloured shirts to ""allow our iconic green apron to shine and create a sense of familiarity for our customers"". In January, it reversed rules for its cafes in North America that allowed people to use their facilities even if they had not bought anything. The changes were a U-turn from a policy introduced six years ago that allowed people to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase. So far Mr Niccol's turnaround efforts have seen limited results. The company's latest financial figures showed that global sales fell by 1% in the three months to the end of March, the fifth quarterly decline in a row. But while trading continued to show weakness in the US, which is its biggest market, sales rose in China and Canada. Starbucks shares fell by more than 6.5% in extended trading after the earnings were announced."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp857gryxn1o","The heartbeat of a billion: What Virat Kohli meant to India",2025-05-13,"Ayaz Memon","Cricket writer","Virat Kohli's retirement from Tests has left Indian cricket beleaguered and the sporting world gasping in surprise. Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters. Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public. ""As I step away from this format, it's not easy – but it feels right…'' he explained to his disconsolate fans. Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal. Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment. ""Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,"" recalls Vengsarkar. An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90. Vengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation. Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism. Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle. When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history. He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played. Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights.  Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight. Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world. His achievements across formats are monumental.  In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit. In T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him in the top five, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in an emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa, which helped India win the title. He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League. At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy. When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp – between 2014 and 2019 – he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months. The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched. Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format . As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions. Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says that Kohli's energy, grit, sense of purpose and aura was ""transformative"" for Indian cricket. Chappell marks him out as the most influential Indian captain, ahead of even Sourav Ganguly and M S Dhoni. Former India captain and chief coach Ravi Shastri, who collaborated with Kohli for years, gives first-hand perspective.  ""Kohli made India into a fighting unit, especially when playing overseas,"" says Shastri. The lack of ICC and IPL titles according to Shastri, is misleading as an index to his  captaincy ability. ""He always played to win, sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas, demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players, putting himself in the forefront, not as a backseat driver."" For seven years when Kohli and Shastri collaborated, India were in the top three in ICC rankings in all formats almost continuously which is unprecedented. The most cherished and significant triumph of  this period came in 2018 when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a Test series for the first time ever. Australia is where Kohli had launched himself into batting greatness, scoring 692 runs in four Tests in 2014-15. In 2018, he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier. In 2020 touring Australia, Kohli played only one match (which was lost) returning home for the birth of his child. But India, having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier, went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see-saw series. Australia was Kohli's happy hunting ground and his last visit Down Under in late 2024 grabbed worldwide attention. He began with a roar, hitting  a century in the first test at Perth. But his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only 190 runs in the five Tests. How much this contributed to his decision to retire is moot. Advancing years, the dislike of being constantly under harsh scrutiny, wanting to be close to his young family and behind the scene shenanigans that abound in Indian cricket have doubtless played a part too. Kohli ends his retirement post on Instagram enigmatically.  ""I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269 signing off,"" he wrote.  The greatest ambassador for the five-day format in the last decade and a half had moved into the sunset. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook."

Sanctions are also being lifted on sectors including financial services and energy production, which the UK government said would help facilitate investment and rebuild Syria's economy.  It comes nearly five months after President Bashar al-Assad was overthrown by a rebel offensive led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), following years of civil war.  The Foreign Office said sanctions on members of the former Assad regime and those involved in the illicit trade in the drug Captagon would remain. Other bodies no longer subject to asset freezes include a number of media organisations and Syria's intelligence agencies, although these were dissolved after the overthrow of Assad. The sanctions were previously imposed on people involved in repressing civilians in Syria, as well as those supporting or benefitting from the Assad regime.  In March the UK lifted asset freezes on 24 Syrian bodies previously used by the Assad regime to fund the oppression of civilians, including the Central Bank of Syria, Syrian Arab Airlines and energy companies.  It is generally prohibited to deal with frozen funds or make funds available to those subject to sanctions.  Minister for the Middle East Hamish Falconer said: ""The Syrian people deserve the opportunity to rebuild their country and economy, and a stable Syria is in the UK's national interest."" Downing Street said the measures would also encourage the return of Syrian refugees to the country. The processing of asylum claims for the thousands of Syrians in the UK was paused in December, with the Home Office saying it was assessing the situation following the fall of Assad.  At the time, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper suggested some would return to Syria following the change of regime.  HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was named as Syria's interim president earlier this year, has called for western sanctions to be lifted, arguing they were a response to the crimes of the previous regime.  HTS is designated a terrorist group by the UK.  However, British diplomats held talks with Al-Sharaa in December, with the government saying it would deal with HTS when necessary.  The Foreign Office said: ""The UK remains committed to working with the Syrian government and international partners to support an inclusive political transition in Syria, including the protection of human rights, unfettered access for humanitarian aid, safe destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, and combatting terrorism and extremism."" The European Union and the US have also been gradually lifting sanctions on Syria, which were imposed following Assad's crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2011. In February the EU announced the suspension of restrictions on transport, energy and banking sectors, while in January the US eased some sanctions including on essential energy services.

A spokesperson for the East of England Ambulance Service said: ""One ambulance and a paramedic car were sent to Norwich Airport this afternoon following reports of a light aircraft in difficulty.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vnyn17p57o","Visit the Arctic vault holding back-ups of great works",2025-05-08,"Adrienne Murray","Technology Reporter","High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole. Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements. One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data. Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.  ""This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,"" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside. Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door. Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored. ""It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,"" Mr Bjerkestrand says. ""It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it."" Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries. Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck. The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads. It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters. ""Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,"" said Mr Bjerkstand. ""There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers."" According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility. ""It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!"" Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries. Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says. At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault. The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps. Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here. ""It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,"" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC. His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. ""Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them."" At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film. ""Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,"" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips. ""We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels."" Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes. The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.  ""We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film."" One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future. That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well. Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential ""digital Dark Age"", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete. That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past. Many firms offer long-term data storage. Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information. For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers. Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome. That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria. The Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault. Photographer, Christian Clauwers, who's been documenting South Pacific Islands threatened by sea level rise, was also adding his work. ""I deposited footage and photography, visual witnesses of the Marshall Islands,"" he says. ""The highest point of the island is three meters, and they're facing huge impact of climate change."" ""It was really humbling and surreal,"" says archivist Joanne Shortland, head of Heritage Collections at the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust, after depositing records, engineers' drawings and photographs of historic car models. ""I have all these formats that are becoming obsolete. ""You need to keep changing the file format and making sure that it's accessible in 20 or 30, years time. The digital world has so many problems."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62g6vdl3vqo","The camera tech propelling shows like Adolescence",2025-05-15,"Chris Baraniuk","Technology Reporter","Three strong knocks from the police battering ram and the front door bursts open. There's a lot of shouting. We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail. Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van. All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month. It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a ""oner"", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming. Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry. At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again. You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator – there's a minuscule wobble – but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless. It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects. This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage. The result is ""phenomenal"", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer. He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. ""As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take."" Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds. In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. ""It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,"" he recalls. Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes – but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence. Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated. He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. ""That's a complete game-changer,"" he says. Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades. Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Grøvlen tells the BBC emphatically, ""There are no edits or cuts."" While Mr Brandth Grøvlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional – the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones. ""It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,"" says Mr Brandth Grøvlen, ""You're taken on a journey."" He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Grøvlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve ""muscle memory"" of the process. ""When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle – that way it shakes a little bit less,"" he explains. The Ronin 4D is DJI's ""first dedicated cinema camera"", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm. He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal. There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming – increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok. Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most ""ideal"" solution, he acknowledges. Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models. Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests. The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. ""Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,"" he says. ""It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories."" There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics. Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices. But fascination over ""oners"" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: ""Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take – I want to watch these things because they're good."""

In a typical three-storey state school in the suburbs of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, nine-year old Slavik is demonstrating his invention - a box with three LED lights. ""He has learned how to control it, and the programming language. You can see the code is written by him,"" says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class. Next to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app. Other children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects. Eleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline. ""I have made my mother's work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,"" he says. ""When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry."" These young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more. The programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as ""root"". Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia. The initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies. ""The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,"" says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE. In his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia. Armath is part of the UATE's education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country. ""We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,"" he says. ""And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (£1.5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches."" There are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students. ""The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,"" says Mr Karapetyan. Armenia is a landlocked country of 2.7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes. Unlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science. In 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers. Today, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus. And there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1.5bn. Krisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories. Meanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th.  A critical factor in boosting Armenia's tech development is the nation's global diaspora – some 75% of the world's estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere. This worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1.6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California. Samvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments. He says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, ""for sure you'll find at least one or two Armenians"" in the boardroom or one management level below. Mr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US. ""Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works. ""It's gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it's like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest."" SmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors. But many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market. Irina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors. Ms Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. ""Patients couldn't find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls."" The app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand. ""We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,"" adds Ms Ghazaryan. ""We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan."" Armenia's tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia. Meanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia. Vasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. ""Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,"" he says. He estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia's tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies. Yet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country. However, overall optimism remains high about Armenia's tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn."

Falling sales in China and heavy discounting in the US, its two biggest markets, have taken a heavy toll on earnings, while a proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi collapsed in February. The latest cutbacks bring the total number of layoffs announced by the company in the past year to about 20,000, or 15% of its workforce. It was not immediately clear where the job cuts will be made, or whether Nissan's plant in Sunderland will be affected. The government said the plant was of ""vital importance"" to the north east of England, and that it would ""engage closely"" with Nissan over its restructuring plans. Nissan employs about 133,500 people globally, with about 6,000 workers in Sunderland. Two-thirds of the latest job cuts will come from manufacturing, with the rest from sales, administration jobs, research and contract staff, said the company's chief executive, Ivan Espinosa. The latest layoffs come on top of 9,000 job cuts Nissan announced in November as part of a cost saving effort that it said would reduce its global production by a fifth. In February, talks between Nissan and its larger rival Honda collapsed after the firms failed to agree on a multi-billion-dollar tie-up.  The plan had been to combine their businesses to fight back against competition from rival firms, especially in China. The merger would have created a $60bn (£46bn) motor industry giant, the fourth largest in the world by vehicle sales after Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai. After the failure of the negotiations, then-chief executive Makoto Uchida was replaced by Mr Espinosa, who was the company's chief planning officer and head of its motorsports division. Nissan also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen ($4.5bn; £3.4bn), with US President Donald Trump's tariffs putting further pressure on the struggling firm. Mr Espinosa said that the previous financial year had been ""challenging"", with rising costs and an ""uncertain environment"", adding that the results were a ""wake-up call"". The car giant did not give a forecast for income in the coming year due to the ""uncertain nature of US tariff measures"". It said it expected flat profit this year even without accounting for the impact of tariffs. Last week, Nissan announced it had scrapped plans to build a battery and electric vehicle factory in Japan as it cuts back on investment. The firm has been in trouble in key markets, including China where growing competition has led to falling prices. In China, many foreign carmakers have struggled to compete with homegrown firms such as BYD. China has become the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles, with some established car-making nations having failed to anticipate demand for the new technology. In the US, another major market for Nissan, inflation and higher interest rates have hit new vehicle sales, although Nissan retail sales rose slightly last year. But sales fell 12% in China, and also dropped in Japan and Europe."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v5r1erdpgo","Why India could not stop IMF bailout to Pakistan",2025-05-14,"Nikhil Inamdar","BBC News London","Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (£756m) bailout to Pakistan – a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared. Despite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan. It also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to ""climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters"", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future.  In a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons. Delhi questioned the ""efficacy"" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's ""poor track record"" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for ""state-sponsored cross-border terrorism"" – a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to ""reputational risks"" and making a ""mockery of global values"". The IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance. Even Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help – getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 – without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance. ""Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,"" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC. But addressing Delhi's other concerns – that the IMF was ""rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism"" thereby sending a ""dangerous message to the global community"" – is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout. India's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was ""circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities"". As one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran. Unlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions – a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies. For example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain – and the decisions are made by consensus on the board. ""This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,"" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC. Addressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023. In their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the ""Global North"" and the ""Global South"". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations. Furthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war. ""It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,"" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC. If India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani.  The FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank. ""Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,"" said Mr Haqqani. ""If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF – as has happened with Pakistan earlier."" As things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022. Separately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword. Such reforms ""would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power"", said Mr Sharma. Mr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using ""bilateral disputes at multilateral fora"", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places. He points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.

But such teams exist in the real world and can be hired to  test the tightest security.  Plenty of firms offer to test computer systems by attempting to remotely hack into them. That's called White Hat Hacking. Breaching physical security is an entirely different type of work. Companies that offer the so-called Red Team service have to assemble staff with very particular skills.  Often using former military and intelligence personnel, Red Teams are asked one question. “How can you break into this top-secret project?” Leonardo, the giant defence company, offers such a service.  It says hostile states seeking disruption and chaos are a real threat and sells its Red Team capability to government, critical infrastructure, and defence sector clients. Other companies offer Red Team services, but there are not many in the business as the specialist skills needed are rare. Firms offering such services like to keep a low profile and are usually extremely reluctant to talk to the press. However, Leonardo's Red Team agreed to speak to the BBC under pseudonyms. Greg, the team leader, served in the engineering and intelligence arms of the British Army, studying the digital capabilities of potential enemies. “I spent a decade learning how to exploit enemy communications,” he says of his background. Now he co-ordinates the five-strong team. The attack is about gaining access. The objective might be to stop a process from working, such as the core of a nuclear power plant. The first step for Greg and his team is called passive reconnaissance. Using an anonymous device, perhaps a smartphone only identifiable by its sim card, the team build a picture of the target. “We must avoid raising suspicions, so the target doesn’t know we’re looking at them,” Greg says. Any technology they employ is not linked to a business by its internet address and is bought with cash. Charlie spent 12 years in military intelligence, his techniques include studying commercial satellite imagery of a site, and scanning job ads to work out what type of people work there. “We start from the edges of the target, staying away. Then we start to move into the target area, even looking at how people who work there dress.” This is known as hostile reconnaissance. They are getting close to the site, but keeping their exposure low, wearing different clothes every time they show up, and swapping out team members, so security people don’t spot the same person walking past the gates. Technology is devised by people and the human factor is the weakest point in any security set-up. This is where Emma, who served in the RAF, comes in. With a background in psychology Emma happily calls herself “a bit of a nosy people watcher”. “People take shortcuts past security protocols. So, we look for disgruntled people at the site.” She listens in to conversations at adjacent cafes and pubs to hear where dissatisfaction with an employer surfaces. “Every organisation has its quirks. We see what the likelihood of people falling for a suspicious email due to workload and fatigue is.” An unhappy security guard may get lazy at work. “We’re looking at access, slipping in with a delivery for instance.” A high turnover rate evidenced by frequently advertised vacancies also flags up dissatisfaction and a lack of engagement with security responsibilities. Tailgating, spotting people who are likely to hold an access door open for a follower, is another technique. Using that intelligence, plus a little subterfuge, security passes can be copied, and the Red Team can enter the premises posing as an employee. Once inside the site Dan knows how to open doors, filing cabinets and desk drawers. He’s armed with lock pick keys known as jigglers, with multiple contours that can spring a lock open. He’s searching for passwords written down, or will use a plug-in smart USB adaptor to simulate a computer keyboard, breaking into a network. The final step in the so-called kill chain, is in the hands of Stanley. A cyber security expert, Stanley knows how to penetrate the most secure computer systems, working on the reconnaissance report from his colleagues. “In the movies it takes a hacker seconds to break into a system, but the reality is different.” He prefers his own “escalatory approach”, working through a system via an administrator’s access and searching for a “confluence”, a collection of information shared in one place, such as a workplace intranet. He can roam through files and data using the administrator’s access. One way a kill chain concludes is when Stanley sends an email impersonating the chief executive of the business via the internal, hence trusted, network. Even though they operate with the approval of the target customer they are breaking into a site as complete strangers. How does this feel? “If you’ve gained access to a server room that is quite nerve-wracking,” says Dan, “but it gets easier the more times you do it.” There is someone at the target site who knows what’s going on. “We stay in touch with them, so they can issue an instruction ‘don’t shoot these people,’” Charlie adds."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy603eg0w8o","OpenAI says non-profit will remain in control after backlash",2025-05-05,"Natalie Sherman","BBC News","OpenAI, the parent of artificial intelligence service ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan after a bitter power struggle over the business. Boss Sam Altman said OpenAI would remain under the control of its non-profit board, while becoming what is known in the US as a public benefit corporation. Mr Altman had put forward a similar plan in December - but without clarifying the control of the non-profit.  The update follows widespread scrutiny of the startup, which began as a non-profit and faced criticism, including from co-founder Elon Musk, that its quest for growth is pushing it to stray from its original mission of creating technology for the benefit of humanity.  Last month, a group of former open AI staff and outside experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, wrote to regulators in California and Delaware, which have power over non-profits, asking them to intervene to block the conversion. OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said the start-up made the decision ""after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California"". In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said the non-profit would continue to control OpenAI, receiving a ""big"", yet-to-be determined stake in OpenAI's business arm, which would give it access to money to put towards its own goals. He said the new plan would still allow the organisation to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits. That was seen as a sticking point for investors, including Microsoft, that hindered the firm's ability to raise money.  ""We are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock,"" he wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the OpenAI website. ""This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler."" Unlike traditional for-profit companies, which are bound to act in service to shareholders, a public benefit corporation is also responsible for a public mission.  In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said he believed that growth and extending access to AI, which would take money, was consistent with the firm's mission, because it would help people ""build incredible things for each other and continue to drive society and quality of life forward"". ""It will of course not be all used for good, but we trust humanity and think the good will outweigh the bad by orders of magnitude,"" he wrote. It is not clear to what extent the new plan will satisfy investors or critics. After the announcement Page Hedley, OpenAI's former policy and ethics adviser, who had spearheaded last month's letter, said the update did not resolve issues such as who would own the firm's technology and how its goals would be prioritised. ""We're glad that OpenAI is listening to concerns from civil society leaders ... but crucial questions remain,"" he said.

Freddie, from Burton Joyce, Nottinghamshire, will see a concert in New Jersey by reggae vocalist Maxi Priest, then record music with the artist at a studio in Maryland. Despite his hearing loss and ADHD, the teenager - who is also autistic - said he had ""been around music [his] whole life"". ""I think I've been able to power through it, without it affecting me too much, because I've been in that positive mindset of 'you know what, I can do anything if I put my mind to it',"" he said. The contest involved submitting a short ""jingle"" script which promoted healthy living. His mum, Sarah, said she knew Freddie would require ""special needs"" because of complications during and after birth, including single umbilical artery syndrome. However, she said that it did not worry her. ""The irony is that I'm actually an audiologist, so I'm working with people with hearing loss all the time. So for me, it didn't really faze me,"" Sarah said. ""He's always been more determined than ever to prove that just because he has these special needs and has to wear hearing aids, it won't stand in the way of him achieving."" Sarah added the opportunity to fly to the US was ""exceptionally exciting"". Beyond the international competition win, Freddie has also started his own music and drama school to support other people with special educational needs. He said there were two students so far, who were being taught through Zoom, but he has aspirations to hire spaces to hold physical sessions. ""It doesn't cost anything to believe in someone, but it makes the biggest difference,"" he said. Sarah added: ""When you're given the news at your 20-week scan, you know, of what [complications] could be ahead, and I look now at my 15-year-old and see what he's achieved. ""I can't honestly believe how far he's come, and how much he supports others. I'm incredibly proud."" The family will fly out to the US on 29 May, ahead of the concert.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15q5qzdjqxo","The people refusing to use AI",2025-05-05,"Suzanne Bearne","Technology Reporter","Nothing has convinced Sabine Zetteler of the value of using AI. ""I read a really great phrase recently that said something along the lines of 'why would I bother to read something someone couldn't be bothered to write' and that is such a powerful statement and one that aligns absolutely with my views."" Ms Zetteler runs her own London-based communications agency, with around 10 staff, some full-time some part-time. ""What's the point of sending something we didn't write, reading a newspaper written by bots, listening to a song created by AI, or me making a bit more money by sacking my administrator who has four kids? ""Where's the joy, love or aspirational betterment even just for me as a founder in that? It means nothing to me,"" she says. Ms Zetteler is among those resisting the AI invasion, which really got going with the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022. Since then the service, and its many rivals have become wildly popular. ChatGPT is racking up over five billion visits a month, according to software firm Semrush. But training AI systems like ChatGPT requires huge amounts of energy and, once trained, keeping them running is also energy intensive.  While it's difficult to quantify the electricity used by AI, a report by Goldman Sachs estimated that a ChatGPT query uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as a Google search query. That makes some people uncomfortable. For Florence Achery, owner of Yoga Retreats & More, the environmental impact is one reason why she vows to stay away from AI. ""My initial reaction was that AI is soulless and is a contradiction with my business, which is all about human connection,"" says Achery, based in London. ""However, I found out that the environmental impact was awful with all the energy consumption required to run the data centres. I don't think that people are aware of that."" While Ms Zetteler admits she respects AI for all the social good it can achieve, she says she's concerned about the wider impact on society. ""I'm happy that AI exists for blind people if they can have articles translated by AI and anything that is truly beneficial. But in general, I don't think it will benefit us long-term."" Is she worried it might have a knock-on effect on her business, especially if rival companies are using AI? ""Like everything, I could save money by sending our agency to Milan on EasyJet flights rather than the train. ""Already my profit margins look unsuccessful if that's how you measure success, but how about if you measure success by how much you're contributing to society and how well you sleep?"" Sierra Hansen, who lives in Seattle and works in public affairs, also refuses to use AI. For her, she's concerned that the use of AI is harming our ability to problem solve. ""Our brain is the thing that helps organise what our days look like, not going to AI Copilot and asking it to tell it how to manage my schedule. ""Our job as a human is to apply critical thinking skills, and if you are feeding simple tasks into ChatGPT then you're not solving on your own. It's doing the thinking for you. If I want to listen to music, I don't need AI to create the perfect punk rock album for me."" But not everyone has the luxury of opting out of AI. Jackie Adams (not her real name), who works in digital marketing, resisted AI initially on environmental grounds, and because she thought using it was lazy. ""I heard about the energy needed to power data centres and the amount of land they take up, and it didn't sit right with me. I didn't understand why we needed it,"" she says. However, about a year ago her three colleagues at the marketing firm she works for started adopting AI, for tasks such as copywriting and idea generation. Six months ago Ms Adams had to follow them, after being told she had to cut her budget. ""Then it was out my control,"" she says. She feels that continuing to resist would have hurt her career. ""I started playing with it a bit more after reading job descriptions asking for AI experience. I recently realised that if I don't implement it into my ways of working, I'm going to get left behind."" Now, she says, she doesn't view tapping into AI as laziness anymore. ""It can elevate my work and make some things better,"" adding that she uses it to refine copywriting work and for editing photos. The moment to opt out of AI has already passed, says James Brusseau, a philosophy professor specialising in AI ethics at Pace University in New York. ""If you want to know why a decision is made, we will need humans. If we don't care about that, then we will probably use AI,"" he says. ""So, we will have human judges for criminal cases, and human doctors to make decisions about who should get the transplant. But, weather forecasting will be gone soon, and anesthesiology too,"" says Prof Brusseau. Ms Adam has accepted using AI at work, but she still feels despondent about AI's growing influence. ""Even when you do a Google search it includes an AI overview, while some emails have a topline summary, So now it almost feels like we have no control. How do I turn all that off?

The 22-year-old has not played this year after dislocating his shoulder in late December, with delays to his surgery following as England and Exeter discussed his treatment.  Baxter says Feyi-Waboso, who scored a try in each of England's three tour matches last summer in Japan and New Zealand, is ""touch and go"" to make Chiefs' final match of the season against Sale on 31 May.  It means he is likely to be fully fit, although he will have had very little game time, should either the British and Irish Lions or England opt to call him up for summer tours. The Lions go to Australia while England will travel to Argentina for a three-Test tour. ""Manny's in that almost fortunate position, he's almost in a no-lose situation,"" Baxter said.  ""He could get back, be up and running, be fit and fresh and perhaps be someone who England might want to take on tour if he's completely up and running and ready to go.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy79j2n7d4o","Temu to stop selling goods from China directly to US customers",2025-05-02,"Peter Hoskins & Charlotte Edwards","Business reporters","Temu has said it will stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform. The online marketplace said sales would now be handled by ""locally based sellers"", with orders fulfilled from within the country. The move comes as a duty-free rule for low-value packages is closed. Temu, and rival Chinese retail giant Shein, had previously relied on the so-called ""de minimis"" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes. Temu said it had been actively recruiting US firms to join the platform. ""All sales in the US are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country. ""The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses,"" it added. Supporters of the de minimis loophole, which applied to parcels worth less than $800 (£600), argue it helped streamline the customs process. But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs. De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as ""of the smallest"". In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies. In the 21st Century, after a series of rises to the threshold, it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without having to pay duties or taxes. Shipments under the exemption accounted for more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US, according to the country's Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu had benefited greatly from the loophole. Both platforms attracted millions of US customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra-low prices And it was the de minimis exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply. Shein did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment. Last month, in almost identical statements, Shein and Temu said they had seen operating expenses rise ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"", adding they would make ""price adjustments"" from 25 April. In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole. The suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors, delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice. During the initial suspension of the exemption the US Postal Service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong. The executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl. It said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages ""to exploit the de minimis exemption"". ""These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone,"" it added. The idea is not new. Last year, the Biden administration proposed rules intended to stop ""abuse"" of the exemption. ""The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments,"" it said. The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year. Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June. Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers were warned of potential price rises. The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in ""$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers"". Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union. In a move mirroring the US action, the UK has announced a review of low-value imports coming into the country. In the UK, the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than £135 without incurring import taxes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the cheap goods are ""undercutting the British High Street and British retailers"". The European Union has also proposed plans to scrap duty-free exemptions for parcels worth less than €150 (£127.50; $169.35). Which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising. Packages that arrived in the US under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods, including being checked for illegal substances. And most synthetic opioids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico, according to officials. Some experts think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by US manufacturers. There are also concerns the move will create more work for US border officials, who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling. According to pro-open trading association the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), removing the de minimis exemption would ""shift the CBP's focus away from the border, where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country."" ""CBP would need to hire and train new personnel, costing the agency millions or causing them to move agents from the already overburdened southern border,"" it added."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql6vgwyv4xo","Who should you trust for a weather forecast?",2025-05-01,"MaryLou Costa","Technology Reporter","As the skies unleashed six months of rain in February over North Queensland, Australia, many locals endured sleepless nights, unsure what level of flooding and damage they would wake up to. Perhaps none more so than Andrew Brown - a cybersecurity lecturer by day, with a side hustle as a self-made amateur weather forecaster. Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland. During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience. He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same. ""When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible."" He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March. ""People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,"" says Mr Brown. Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre. People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford. Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology. When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings. Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability. ""Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,"" says Prof Angus. ""They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't. ""Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on."" Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for. In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise. Higgins Storm Chasing, which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas Hinterdorfer, didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview. ""Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,"" explains Prof Angus. ""What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,"" says Professor Angus. ""They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. "" It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases. Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic. But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession. ""There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,"" he says. ""Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown. ""On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. "" While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications. His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs. The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation. Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page. Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month. ""It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,"" says Mr Markowitz. Back in Australia, Mr Brown says he would like to retire from teaching, and have more time to focus on Wally's Weather, and to spend with his grandchildren, but acknowledges that this is a while away. But what he doesn't want is to be the face of the page - something he's so far avoided. ""I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,"" says Mr Brown. ""Sometimes I can stand in line and hear people talking about the page, and they have no idea that I'm right there. It all adds to the fun."""

The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs President Donald Trump has announced since his return to the White House in January. But it will leave a 10% duty in place on most goods from the UK. Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year. No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details. Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a ""fantastic platform"". ""This historic deal delivers for British business and British workers protecting thousands of British jobs in key sectors including car manufacturing and steel,"" he said, adding that the ""the UK has no greater ally than the United States"". At the White House, Trump called it a ""great deal"" and pushed back against criticism that he was overstating its importance. ""This is a maxed out deal that we're going to make bigger,"" he said.  The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25% last month - to 10% for 100,000 cars a year.  That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs. ""This was very serious,"" he said. ""It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough."" Tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump raised earlier this year to 25%, have also been slashed, according to the Prime Minister's Office. The US said instead it would establish a quota, as had existed previously. The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative. The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes.  Overall, the US said the deal would create a $5bn (£3.8bn) ""opportunity"" for exports, including $700m in ethanol and $250m in other agricultural products.  ""It can't be understated how important this deal is,"" US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said. UK Steel director General Gareth Stace welcomed the agreement, saying it would offer ""major relief"" to the steel sector. ""The UK government's cool-headed approach and perseverance in negotiating with the US clearly paid off,"" he said.  Other business groups expressed more uncertainty. ""It's better than yesterday but it's definitely not better than five weeks ago,"" said Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, which represents firms in the two countries and supports free trade. ""I'm trying to be excited but I'm struggling a bit."" While Labour MPs praised the deal, opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in Parliament. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US. ""This is not a historic deal with the US,"" she said. ""We've been shafted.""  The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show ""complete disrespect to the public"" if MPs were denied a say. Sir Ed Davey said: ""When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail. ""One thing is clear, Trump's trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK."" Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the deal was a ""step in the right direction"". He told the BBC there was more detail to come but in the round it was a welcome development. ""The important point is that we are doing stuff, we are making a move,"" he said. ""It's a Brexit benefit we were able to do this.""  The US and UK have been discussing a trade deal since Trump's first term. They came close to signing a mini-agreement at that time.  But the US has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues, which had been non-starters politically for the UK. It was not clear how much those issues had advanced.  The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the agreement in-principle had delivered a ""tremendous win"" for American ranchers but the US Meat Export Federation, which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the US, said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes. The UK said there would be no weakening in food standards for imports.  While the UK appears to have made some commitments, ""the devil will be in the details,"" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics, which said it was making no change to its economic forecasts as a result of the announcement. Other issues loom. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to tax imports of pharmaceuticals, in a bid to ensure the US has a strong manufacturing base for critical medicines.  The UK said the US had agreed to give British firms ""preferential treatment"".  But Ewan Townsend, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter, who works with health care firms, said the industry was now ""left waiting to see exactly what this preferential treatment will mean""."

Under the agreement in principle, a Foxconn joint venture will design and build cars in Taiwan for Mitsubishi. The companies say they expect the new model to be available by the end of next year, under what would be Foxconn's first major contract in the booming and highly competitive EV industry. Japanese car makers like Mitsubishi have faced growing competition from mainland Chinese rivals, particularly in markets in South East Asia, South America and Europe.  The companies said the cars will be built by Foxtron - Foxconn's EV joint venture with Taiwanese car maker, Yulon Motor.  ""Foxtron will provide design and manufacturing management services and this model is expected to enter the Australia and New Zealand markets in the second half of 2026,"" they added. At this stage, the agreement is a so-called memorandum of understanding - a non-binding deal between the two companies. The companies have said they ""will proceed with discussions towards a definitive agreement."" Foxconn is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and counts major technology companies such has Apple among its customers.  It previously said it would consider buying a stake in Japan's Nissan Motor for ""co-operation"" as it looked to get into the motor industry. Mitsubishi Motors is a junior partner in an alliance between Nissan and French car maker Renault. The moves come as China's car industry has expanded rapidly in recent years and the world's second largest economy has emerged as a leader in the growing EV market. Established car makers around the world have struggled to compete as major Chinese players like BYD continue to win new customers. "

The website for the $Trump meme coin says its 220 biggest holders will be invited to a private gala dinner with the president on 22 May, describing it as the ""most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world."" According to crypto trading platform Coinbase, $Trump jumped by more than 70% after the announcement. But it remains well below the record high of more than $74 (£42.40) reached shortly after its launch in January. The digital currency is one of several crypto-related ventures launched by businesses linked to Trump, who has called himself the ""crypto president"". As well as the gala dinner, which will be held at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington DC, there will be ""an ultra-exclusive private VIP reception with the President"" for the top 25 coin holders, the coin's website said. Trump tokens in circulation are currently worth a total of around $2.5bn. They were first released just days before his inauguration on 20 January. The move was criticised by several people in the crypto industry, with some calling it ""a stunt"". First lady Melania Trump also launched a cryptocurrency on the eve of the inauguration. Meme coins are often used by speculators to make money or to allow fans to show support to a celebrity or moment in internet culture. Shortly after returning to the White House this year, Trump signed an executive order to create a presidential working group tasked with proposing new crypto laws and regulations. He has also signed an order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include other digital currencies. Those funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings. This week, Trump's media company announced plans to launch exchange traded-funds (ETFs). The financial products to be launched by Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of the Truth Social platform, and its partners will include digital assets as well as stocks with a ""Made in America focus"". ETFs are investment funds that hold multiple assets. They can be bought and sold in a similar way to shares."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99n8r38rdlo","What is bug hunting and why is it changing?",2025-04-28,"Joe Fay","Technology Reporter","Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up. But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter. Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew ""I wanted to be a hacker or work in security"". He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: ""I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun."" But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back. Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash ""bounty"" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s. Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities. As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a ""morally agnostic skill set"", bug hunters do have to operate within the law. Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the ""scope"" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate ""hammering"" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money. The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. ""We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes."" Platforms like Bugcrowd mean ""you can use hackers as a force for good,"" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered – and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one ""we deem very severe"". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (£19,300) reward. So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m. But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is ""tens of thousands."" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still. Mr Murtagh says: ""A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation."" But he adds, ""It doesn't always happen."" Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore. Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact. ""In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong."" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but ""designed to be used by anyone"". Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place. And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers – both ethical and not – can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems. But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says. He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to ""crack"". Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: ""I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data."" But these systems are also vulnerable to more ""traditional"" web app techniques, he says. ""I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications."" But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems. ""If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws."" Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but ""I think it's just a matter of time"". In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. ""The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe."" That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: ""Once a hacker, always a hacker."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8dpy27pv0o","Nissan says it could share global plants with Chinese state firm",2025-05-16,"Adam Hancock","Business reporter, BBC News","Car maker Nissan says it is open to sharing factories around the world with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as it shakes up its business. The Japanese firm, which employs thousands of people in the UK, told the BBC it could bring Dongfeng ""into the Nissan production eco-system globally."" This week, the struggling company said it would lay off 11,000 workers and shut seven factories but did not say where the cuts would be made. Speaking about Nissan's UK plant on Thursday at a conference organised by the Financial Times, its boss Ivan Espinosa said: ""We have announced that we are launching new cars in Sunderland... In the very short term, there's no intention to go around Sunderland."" Nissan's revelation it is willing to strengthen ties with the Chinese firm comes as the UK's trade relationship with China is in the spotlight.  On Wednesday, the UK government moved to rebutt suggestions the tariff agreement it reached with the US last week could be damaging to China. It said there was ""no such thing as a veto on Chinese investment"" in the deal. The UK-US agreement rowed back on big hikes in tariffs on metals and cars imposed by US President Donald Trump, but it also included conditions requiring the UK to ""promptly meet"" US demands on the ""security of the supply chains"" of steel and aluminium products exported to America. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said China had ""made representations to the UK, asking for clarification"". ""China is firmly opposed to any party seeking a deal at the expense of China's interests. Should that situation arise, China will respond as necessary.""  Nissan's latest job cuts came on top of 9,000 layoffs announced in November as it faces weak sales in key markets such as the US and China. The total cuts will hit 15% of its workforce as part of a cost saving effort that it said would reduce its global production by a fifth. Nissan's own brands have struggled to make in-roads in China, which is the world's biggest car market, as stiff competition has led to falling prices. It has partnered with Beijing-controlled Dongfeng for more than 20 years and they currently work together to build cars in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Nissan employs around 133,500 people globally, with about 6,000 workers in Sunderland. The firm has also faced a number of leadership changes and failed merger talks with its larger rival Honda.  Negotiations between the two collapsed in February after the firms were unable to agree on a multi-billion-dollar tie-up. After the failure of the talks, then-chief executive Makoto Uchida was replaced by Mr Espinosa, who was the company's chief planning officer and head of its motorsports division. This week, Nissan also reported an annual loss of 670bn yen ($4.6bn; £3.4bn), with US President Donald Trump's tariffs putting further pressure on the struggling firm. This month, Nissan's battery partner AESC secured a £1bn ($1.3bn) funding package from the UK government for a new plant in Sunderland. It will produce batteries for the Juke and Leaf electric models. Visiting the site, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said the move would ""deliver much-needed high-quality, well-paid jobs to the North East""."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62jxdxng7do","Who will win the race to develop a humanoid robot?",2025-04-24,"Carrie King and Ben Morris","BBC News","It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot. I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows. Standing at about 4'3"" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral. Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager. He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions. Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room. They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease. Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form. The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises. It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher. But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.  Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem. To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous. So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine. ""The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,"" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC. ""Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning – such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way – a challenge,"" they said.  At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development. For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.  The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that ""several thousand"" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing ""useful things"" in Tesla factories. Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021. Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms. Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market. ""The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],"" he says.  Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (£12,500). Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations. In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.  Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.  For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks. So how can US and European robot makers compete with that? Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot. While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.  ""The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place. ""So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia."" As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form. Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs. ""All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?"" he asks. Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.  ""My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,"" he says. Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real ""secret sauce"" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans. ""A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.  ""What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,"" Mr Pierce says. He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times. The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.  So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off. ""My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,"" says Mr Pierce. ""I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that's at least 10 to 15 years away."""

""Following articles based on comments made by the JLR CEO in the full year earnings media call, we can confirm we have no plans to build cars in the US,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. Jaguar, which has no factories in the US, paused shipments to the country in April after Trump's first tariff announcements, before resuming exports to the country this month. This week, the firm joined a growing list of companies to hold back on giving profit forecasts, as Trump's unpredictable trade policies continue to impact businesses around the world. On Trump's self-declared 'Liberation Day' in early April he announced that the UK would be subject to 10% tariffs on all the the goods it exports to the US. More stringent measures were later applied to cars, steel and aluminium. But last week, the US agreed to allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, and reduced the levies on a set number of British cars. A blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods entering the US. Rival luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz, and Chrysler-owner Stellantis have also held back on giving forecasts, while Ford said the US levies will cost it about $1.5bn (£1.13bn) this year. Outside the motor industry, top executives at well-known firms have warned recently about the impact that tariffs are having on their companies and the wider economy. Last month, technology giant Intel, footwear maker Skechers and consumer goods firm Procter & Gamble either cut their profit forecasts or withdrew them, citing economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, sportswear giant Adidas warned import taxes imposed by Trump will lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba. This month, Barbie maker Mattel said it will put up the prices of some of its toys in the US as tariffs increase its costs."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7e2z1rxyo","Trump considering 100% tariffs on movies not made in the US",2025-05-05,"Peter Hoskins","Business reporter","Donald Trump says he will talk to Hollywood executives, after his earlier announcement to hit films made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs sent shockwaves through the industry. The US president said on Sunday he was authorising the commerce department to start the process to impose the levy because America's film industry was dying ""a very fast death"". But he appeared to soften his stance later on Monday, telling reporters at the White House he was going to ""meet with the industry"" to ""make sure they're happy"" with his proposal. For years, filmmakers have been leaving Hollywood for destinations including the UK and Canada to lower costs.  One non-US union said the tariff plan would be a ""knock-out blow"" to the international industry. Trump said on his Truth Social platform: ""It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!""  ""WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!"" US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick responded to the announcement, saying ""We're on it"". But the details are unclear. Trump's statement did not say whether the tariff would apply to American production companies producing films abroad. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC: ""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again."" Several recent major films produced by US studios were shot outside of America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. It was also unclear if the tariffs would apply to films on streaming services, such as Netflix, as well as those shown at cinemas, or how they would be calculated. The founder of European cinema chain Vue, Timothy Richards, questioned how Trump would define a US film. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""Is it where the money comes from? The script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?"" Mr Richards said the cost of filming in southern California had grown significantly over the last few decades, prompting filmmakers to move production to locations including the UK, which have increasingly offered tax incentives and lower costs. ""But it's not just the actual financing itself,"" he added. ""One of reasons UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly experienced and skilled film and production crew in the world. ""The devil will be in the details."" Meanwhile, UK media union Bectu warned the tariffs could ""deal a knock-out blow"" to the industry and its tens of thousands of freelancers, as it recovered from the pandemic and a ""recent slowdown"". Union chief Philippa Childs told the BBC: ""The government must move swiftly to defend this vital sector, and support the freelancers who power it, as a matter of essential national economic interest."" The UK government said it was ""absolutely committed"" to ensuring its film sector continued to thrive and create jobs, and would set out plans to do so in its upcoming Creative Industries Sector Plan. It added that talks on an economic deal with the US were ongoing but a ""running commentary"" on progress was ""not in the national interest"".  The British Film Institute said it was working closely with the government and industry partners in the UK and the US ""while we understand the detail of the proposal"". ""We want to keep collaboration at the heart of our sectors, so we remain a constructive partner to our friends in the US and internationally,"" it said. The US remains a major film production hub globally despite challenges, according to movie industry research firm ProdPro. Its most recent annual report shows the country saw $14.54bn (£10.94bn) of production spending last year. Although that was down by 26% since 2022.  And NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry.  Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it ""harder for these films to make profits overseas"". ""It may create a situation where the tariffs in America are causing more harm than good,"" he added.  The Motion Picture Association, which represents the five major US film studios, declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. Countries that have attracted an increase in spending since 2022 include Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK, according to ProdPro. Following Trump's remarks, Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said: ""Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry."" Industry body Screen Producers Australia said that while there were ""many unknowns"" about the plan, there was ""no doubt it will send shock waves worldwide"". New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon also said his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs. ""But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,"" he told a news conference. Ahead of his inauguration, Trump appointed three film stars - Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone - to be special ambassadors tasked with promoting business opportunities in Hollywood, which he described as a ""great but very troubled place"". Trump wrote at the time: ""They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK - BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!"" Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed tariffs on countries around the world. He argues tariffs - which are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries -  will boost US manufacturers and protect jobs. But the global economy has been thrown into chaos as a result, and prices on goods around the world are expected to rise. Even before this most recent announcement, the US movie industry had been impacted by the fallout from Trump's trade policies. In April, China said it was reducing its quota of American films allowed into the country. ""The wrong action of the US government to abuse tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience's favourability towards American films,"" the China Film Administration said.  ""We will follow the market rules, respect the audience's choice, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported.""

The firm also says it will cut the number of products it makes in China for the American market. At the same time, car making giant Ford says the levies will cost it about $1.5bn (£1.13bn) this year. They join a growing list of big businesses warning about the impact of US tariffs on their companies and the wider economy. ""Given the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving US tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending, and Mattel's US sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season,"" Mattel said as it updated investors on its financial performance. The US accounts for about half of Mattel's global toy sales. It imports around 20% of its goods sold there from China.  The company said it plans to reduce those Chinese imports to the US to below 15% by next year. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed new import taxes of up to 145% on goods from China.  His administration said last month that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US. Apart from China, Mattel imports products – including Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars – from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The three countries were also hit with steep tariffs by Trump in April, before they were paused for 90 days. Last week, Trump acknowledged the potential impact of tariffs. American children might ""have two dolls instead of 30 dolls"", he said, but added that China would suffer more than the US. Carmaker Ford said it expected tariffs to add $2.5bn to its overall costs this year, mainly due to the increased expense of Mexican and Chinese imports. But the firm said it had cut about $1bn of those added costs by taking various measures, including transporting vehicles from Mexico to Canada to avoid US tariffs. The firm also suspended its annual earnings guidance to investors because of uncertainty around Trump's trade policies. In April, firms including technology giant Intel, footwear makers Adidas and Skechers, and consumer goods group Procter & Gamble detailed the impact of tariffs on their businesses. ""The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown with the probability of a recession growing,"" Intel's chief financial officer David Zinsner said during a call with investors. Sportswear giant Adidas warned tariffs would lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers, including the Gazelle and the Samba. The finance chief of footwear firm Skechers, David Weinberg, told investors: ""The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success.""  And Procter & Gamble – which makes Ariel laundry detergent, Head & Shoulders shampoo and Gillette shaving products – said it was considering changes to its prices to make up for the extra cost of materials sourced from China and other places."

The organisation predicted UK inflation would be the highest in the world's advanced economies this year at 3.1%, largely due to higher bills, including for energy and water. The fund also said the UK economy would grow less than previously predicted, up 1.1% in 2025 instead of 1.6%, because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. The report comes as top economic policymakers meet in Washington this week at the IMF's spring gathering. The downgrade in the outlook for the UK economy is nevertheless ahead of predictions for France, Italy and Germany. US President Donald Trump's tariffs, a steep increase in borrowing costs and a hit from inflation all contributed to the downgrade. IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters that the IMF expected three more interest rate cuts by the Bank of England in 2025 after a quarter-point cut in February. The report said that the spike in inflation expected this year would be a ""temporary phenomenon"" which would leave room for rate cuts.  However, Trump tariffs could also push down the pace of UK price rises as goods are diverted away from the US. The IMF expects UK inflation to slow to 2.2% by 2026, close to the Bank's 2% target. In response to the predictions, Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted how the IMF still saw stronger economic growth in the UK in 2025 than in Europe's other big countries. ""The report also clearly shows that the world has changed, which is why I will be in Washington this week defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade,"" Reeves said. She is due to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent where she is expected to make Britain's case for a trade agreement with Washington that would lower or eliminate US tariffs on British goods. Mr Gourinchas said the global economy still bore ""significant scars"" from the ""severe shocks of the past four years"". ""It is now being severely tested once again,"" he added. The US growth forecast for this year was given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the IMF becayse of uncertainty caused by trade tariffs. US growth is now expected to be 1.8% this year, down from the IMF's estimate of 2.7% in January. Trump has made a flurry of announcements on tariffs this year - taxes charged on goods brought into the US from other countries. In a growing trade war, the US has placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, while China has hit back with 125% on US products. The US has also introduced a 10% tax on goods from the vast majority of other countries, while suspending much higher rates for dozens of nations for 90 days. Trump argues that tariffs will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and lead to huge levels of investment in the country."

It attracted 83,966 visitors last year, a 13% rise from 2023, and led by new direct flights from the US, and the opening of more hotels. Nicknamed the ""Nature Island"", and now recovered from the extensive damage caused by 2017's Hurricane Maria, Dominica's government is set to harness its natural resources to generate clean electricity for its 66,000 residents and tourism sector. To end the country's long reliance on generators fuelled by imported diesel, a geothermal power station is being built in the south of the country. It will access the boiling hot water contained in natural underground reservoirs that are heated by the surrounding volcanic rock. The 10-megawatt plant, under construction near the village of Laudat in the lush Roseau Valley, is on track to become operational by the end of the year. Steam will be drawn up to the surface to drive turbines that will generate electricity. The used steam will then be cooled to the point where it becomes water again, and reinjected back underground for the process to restart. ""We hope to totally eliminate the need for diesel generation for electricity in Dominica by 2030,"" Dominica's energy minister Dr Vince Henderson tells the BBC. The government also says that the geothermal plant will reduce electricity bills. And it is not just Dominica (not to be confused with the similarly named Dominican Republic), that is set to benefit. Long-term plans include exporting surplus electricity via undersea cables to neighbouring islands. Dr Henderson adds that he hopes the success of the geothermal plant will inspire other Caribbean nations to explore more renewable energy sources. Dominica's geothermal plant will be just the second in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France, has had a 15-megawatt station in operation for three decades. The Roseau Valley facility is being created through a public-private partnership between the Dominican government and US-Israeli renewable energy company Ormat Technologies. It is costing tens of millions of US dollars, partially funded by grants and investments from several governments, including the US, UK, Japan and New Zealand. Additional funding has come from various non-governmental organizations from around the world, and loans from the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). The Dominican government has also ploughed significant resources into the project, which required high upfront costs and a complex exploration process including drilling deep underground to test temperatures. ""Finding the resource is the first challenge. Then you need someone like us to build the facility,"" says Ormat's chief executive Doron Blachar. ""Ormat is doing the entire project, from making the plant's elements, shipping them to Dominica, mainly from Israel, and then constructing the power plant."" Ormat has been designing and building renewable energy systems for more than five decades, and owns and operates geothermal plants in various countries from the Americas to Africa. ""Geothermal is a great, zero-emission electricity that doesn't depend on wind or sun, and operates 24/7,"" Mr Blachar explains. ""It brings jobs to a country, both during construction and, more importantly, during the plant's operations, along with new technology and expertise."" Yet despite geothermal's green credentials, Dominica's new plant has raised concerns among some local residents, including environmentalist Atherton Martin who fears for the effects on the ecologically valuable Roseau Valley. ""There is no other area like it in the Caribbean,"" he says, adding that the removal of vegetation during the exploration process ""decimated wildlife"" including endemic frogs. Other residents told the BBC of some controversy over the amount of money the project was costing. It has certainly been several years in the making with the Dominican government alone said to have invested around $15m (£11.3m). Dr Henderson admits that the project is ""not easy"" for a country that ""faced a big challenge"" when it had to substantially repair its electricity network after 2017's Hurricane Maria. But he insists ""it will be worth it in the end"". Another common fear about geothermal plants is the potential for triggering earthquakes. Ormat says it has never had a such an incident in its many years of operations. Mr Blachar believes the Caribbean could become ""a hub"" for geothermal technology. Ormat acquired Guadeloupe's plant from the French government in 2017 and is currently expanding it to boost its capacity to 25 megawatts. With support from the CDB and driven by the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Commission, work is also under way to explore and develop geothermal potential in fellow volcanic island nations Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Ormat will operate the Dominica plant for 20 years before handing it over to state electricity provider Domlec. Mr Blachar estimates it will employ around 30 local people when it comes on stream later this year. It should initially generate enough power to meet half of Dominica's peak electricity demand, says Fred John, managing director of the government-owned Dominica Geothermal Development Company, which is also involved in the scheme. Authorities are confident the plant will then soon support the entire country, and have enough spare electricity for some to be exported to neighbouring islands. Mr John says that the facility will ""serve as a test case for an attractive alternative"" to fossil fuels. ""The rest of the OECS will benefit from the lessons learned here – both what worked and what didn't,"" he adds. The OECS recently set a target to reach 30% renewable energy within 10 years, with some countries, including Dominica and St Kitts, aiming for 100% by then. OECS Director General Dr Didacus Jules describes Dominica's geothermal project as a ""bold and visionary step"". ""As a region heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, the transition to green energy is not optional - it is existential,"" he tells the BBC. ""This development also breathes new life into the long-held vision of a regional energy grid - one that connects our islands through clean, reliable, and affordable energy."""

The comments come after reports that the US plans to pressure governments to restrict trade with China in exchange for exemptions to US tariffs. The Trump administration has started talks with trading partners over tariffs, with a Japanese delegation visiting Washington last week and South Korea is set to start negotiations this week. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed hefty taxes on Chinese imports, while other countries have also been hit with levies on their goods. ""Appeasement cannot bring peace, and compromise cannot earn one respect,"" a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said. ""China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests. If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures"". The remarks echoed an editorial last week in the state-controlled China Daily, which warned the European Union against trying to ""appease"" the US. The comments came after reports that the US plans to use tariff negotiations to pressure dozens of countries into imposing new barriers on trade with China. The BBC has asked the US Treasury Department and the US Trade Representative for responses to the reports. Trump has said more than 70 countries have reached out to start negotiations since the tariffs were announced. ""If you put the numbers on it, about 20% of Japan's profitability comes from the United States, about 15% comes from the People's Republic of China,"" said Jesper Koll, from Japanese online trading platform operator Monex Group. ""Certainly, Japan doesn't want to [have to] choose between America and the People's Republic of China."" Japan kicked off negotiations with the US last week when its top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, met the US President in Washington DC. South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo, has said his country will begin trade talks with the US later this week.  Meanwhile, US Vice President, JD Vance, is expected to meet India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a visit to the country this week. India faces a tariff rate of 26% if it is unable to agree a trade deal with the Trump administration. Last week, Vance said there was a ""good chance"" a trade deal could be reached with the UK. ""We're certainly working very hard with Keir Starmer's government,"" he said in an interview with the UnHerd website. Since Trump's inauguration, there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs. The US president has said the import taxes will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to major investments in the country. But critics have said bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime. Trump has also backtracked on many of his announcements. Just hours after steep levies on dozens of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, he announced a 90-day pause on those tariffs to all countries bar China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets. Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July. His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to ""fight to the end"". The trade war between the world's two biggest economies sent shockwaves through the global financial markets earlier this month."

But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely. Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk ""as long as I could keep him"". The tech boss said he would now ""be allocating far more of my time to Tesla"", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work ""critical"" and pledging to stay on ""as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful"". On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%. The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying ""changing political sentiment"" could meaningfully hurt demand. Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would ""try to attack me and the Doge team"".  Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results. Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. ""Rapidly evolving trade policy"" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company. ""This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,"" Tesla's quarterly update said.  Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro. On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were ""still tough on a company where margins are low"". ""I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,"" he said. Earlier this month, he called Navarro a ""moron"" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was ""not a car manufacturer"" but a ""car assembler, in many cases"". Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire ""focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences"". ""I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,"" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase. Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past.  Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations ""rock-bottom"" after the company said earlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years. The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks.

After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat. ""One thing you cannot have is a puncture,"" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin. The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover. Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears. As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027. Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030. The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface. ""The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,"" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand. ""We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,"" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio. One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges. At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving.  And that's a problem for tyres. ""Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,"" says Dr Padula. The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape. ""If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,"" says Dr Padula. The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in. The next space missions will need to drive round ""bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger"", he says. And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon.  Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles. Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres. ""In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,"" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028. One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium. ""Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company. He calls nitinol's flexible properties ""one of the craziest things you will ever see"". Nitinol is a potentially ""revolutionary"" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says. However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon.  Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels. Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil. Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex. The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface. Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May). Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them. Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface. Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes. ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet. The work might have some useful applications here on Earth. While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre. An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres. Priced around $150 (£120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable.  He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads.  For all this, his ""dream"" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon. ""So, I can tell my kids, look up there on the Moon,"" he says. ""Daddy's tyres are up there."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly80zlk1lyo","California passes Japan as fourth largest economy",2025-04-25,"Christal Hayes","BBC News, Los Angeles","California's economy has overtaken that of the country of Japan, making the US state the fourth largest global economic force. Governor Gavin Newsom touted new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis showing California's growth.  The data shows California's gross domestic product (GDP) hit $4.10 trillion (£3.08 trillion) in 2024, surpassing Japan, which was marked at $4.01 trillion. The state now only trails Germany, China and the US as a whole. ""California isn't just keeping pace with the world - we're setting the pace,"" Newsom said. The new figures come as Newsom has spoken out against President Donald Trump's tariffs and voiced concern about the future of the state's economy.  California has the largest share of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US. It is also home to leading technological innovation, the centre of the world's entertainment industry and the country's two largest seaports.  Newsom, a prominent Democrat and possible presidential candidate in 2028, filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's authority to impose the levies, which have caused disruption to global markets and trade.  Trump has enacted 10% levies on almost all countries importing to the US, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs.  Another 25% tariff was imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy.  Trump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products. His administration said last week that when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. Newsom noted his worries about the future of the state's economy.  ""While we celebrate this success, we recognise that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration,"" he said. ""California's economy powers the nation, and it must be protected."" Trump has argued his trade war is only levelling the playing field after years of the US being taken advantage of.  The tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. It is one major pillar of his economic agenda, as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans. The new data shows California's GDP behind the US at $29.18 trillion, China at $18.74 trillion and Germany at $4.65 trillion. It also shows California was the fastest growing among those countries. Japan's economy is under pressure because of its decreasing and ageing population, which means its workforce is shrinking and social care costs are ballooning.  This week, the IMF cut its economic growth forecast for Japan and projected that  the central bank would raise interest rates more slowly than previously expected because of the impact of higher tariffs. ""The effect of tariffs announced on April 2 and associated uncertainty offset the expected strengthening of private consumption with above-inflation wage growth boosting household disposable income,"" its World Economic Outlook report said."

The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguarán belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing. With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature. ""You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,"" Mr Iguarán says. His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more. ""At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,"" Mr Iguarán adds. The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family. Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguarán says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones. Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions. Mr Iguarán believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm. ""The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,"" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela. His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption. ""Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,"" he adds. These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits. ""There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,"" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu. ""In Colombia… there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable."" In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renováveis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable. One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113. EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to ""constant protests"" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023. Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard. And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms. ""We call it the 'wind wars',"" says Ms Barney. For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies. ""There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,"" he says. This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects. ""For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected."" By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs. While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix. For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect. One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms. The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits. But it says good community relations are not enough. ""We cannot do these projects alone,"" says Federico Echavarría, general manager of AES Colombia. ""The government must help resolve conflicts between communities."" On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state. Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water. Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jagüeys – reservoirs filled with rainwater. His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit. Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. ""The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,"" he laments. The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term. While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70zy5w983go","Trump eases car tariffs after firms raised concerns",2025-04-29,"Peter Hoskins & Natalie Sherman","Business reporters, BBC News","US President Donald Trump has taken action to ease the impact of new tariffs on the car making industry, which had sparked warnings about higher prices and the potential for significant hits to sales and production.  The change will allow companies with US factories to reduce the amount they pay in import taxes on foreign parts, using a formula tied to how many cars they sell and the price. The provision is intended to provide relief to businesses for two years as they rework their supply chains, the White House said. Officials also moved to shield car firms from facing mounting tariffs on the same items. They said businesses that have to pay tariffs on cars and parts would not be charged other duties the administration has imposed on steel, aluminium and goods from Canada and Mexico. The changes came as Trump visited Michigan on Tuesday for a rally to mark his first 100 days in office. The state is home to the so-called Detroit Three carmakers - Ford, General Motors (GM) and Stellantis - and a network of more than 1,000 major suppliers to the industry. Those firms and the wider industry have been plunged into uncertainty since Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts in March, saying he wanted to expand domestic car manufacturing - an industry the White House sees as key to national security.  Trump's tariff announcement drove a spike in sales, as consumers rushed to get ahead of the tariffs. But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond.  Ahead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures.  ""We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,"" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement. ""We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together."" General Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance.  In an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results.  Tariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month. The duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May.  Under the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an ""offset"" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US.  That share would fall to 2.5% in the second year. The White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year.  The adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad. In remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a ""very, very small part of the car"" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US. ""We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,"" he said.   Last week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts.  A letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would ""lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive"". Ford said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would ""help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers"". ""We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,"" a statement added. The car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were ""essential"". ""It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,"" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a ""windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs"". Stellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs.  ""We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,"" he added."

So imagine the surprise when more than 100 Spanish sports fans turned up to enjoy the non-league club's match against St Ives Town on Saturday. The Spaniards were subscribers to a Spanish YouTube channel devoted to English football which has now started arranging trips. ""Some of the local fans were quite surprised, probably wondering what 100 Spaniards were doing there,"" said Madrid-born and new Harborough Town fan  Alvaro Sanz. The channel La Media Inglesa (LMI) was founded by Barcelona-born Ilie Oleart and covers English football matches for Spanish speaking fans across the world. Since launching in 2011, the channel has gained more than 440,000 subscribers and began offering trips to the UK in 2018 so the fans could watch games in person. Mr Oleart, who supports La Liga side Espanyol, said the next step for LMI was to not only show English football but also try to be involved with an English football club in some way.  ""Our aim was to transform a small local English club into a small local club with a global fanbase,"" he said. After speaking to different lower league clubs, Mr Oleart asked his subscribers which club they should link up with - and Harborough Town FC emerged as the fans' choice. ""I met people at the club in September to get to know their history, the town and the facilities,"" said Mr Oleart. ""We thought they were the perfect club with the right values to share with our audience."" Harborough Town games in the seventh tier of English football will now be live-streamed on the LMI Youtube channel, giving Spanish-speaking fans a chance to become ""virtual supporters"" of the club. The club - nicknamed the Bees - have already captured the imagination this season by reaching the FA Cup second round for the first time and having former Brazilian international Sandro play for them. Club chairman Peter Dougan said the partnership with LMI was an ""opportunity to grow our fanbase and our income"" through a global audience and could open the door to sponsorship deals. ""It was being in the right place at the right time,"" he said. ""LMI liked what they saw and we decided they were right for our club too."" Despite Harborough losing 2-1 to St Ives Town in their Southern League Premier Central encounter, Mr Oleart said his group was ""very happy"" with their experience. ""It was certainly the best trip we have had so far,"" he said. ""We occupied a full stand and started cheering from the first second of the game,"" added fan Alvaro Sanz. ""Quite a few local fans joined us, and we even taught them some chants in Spanish. ""We didn't stop supporting the team for the entire match."" Before the game, residents watched in amusement as two coachloads of Spanish supporters arrived in the town centre before marching around singing Spanish songs before kick-off. ""It wasn't just any club any more, it felt like our club,"" said Mr Oleart.  ""We were able to meet the players after the match and even have a drink with them in the pub, which is something that is impossible to imagine at a Premier League club. ""We wanted to ensure the trip was a chance for us to create a relationship with their fans too. ""There are many things to do to work on the alliance and to make it stronger, but I am sure there are many great memories to create in the future and I am hoping to bring 200-300 fans with me next time. ""Many football fans are looking for this experience and we are glad to do it with Harborough Town FC."" Bees chairman Pete Dougan said: ""It was a great day and the atmosphere they generated was superb. ""It was like song tennis in the stadium, our fans were singing songs in English and then they sang songs back in Spanish. It was good fun."" Dougan said he was looking forward to welcoming his new fans back next season and revealed the club are heading to Barcelona and Madrid for a pre-season tour in July.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1erz9jxko","Is the US finally on track to build a high-speed rail network?",2025-05-13,"Sam Gruet & Megan Lawton","Business reporters","The US is a country of 340 million people, 71 interstate highways, more than 5,000 public airports, and currently no high-speed railways. Yet with two high-speed rail (HSR) projects now under construction, and others planned, is the US finally on track to start catching up with the fast trains seen in China, Japan and Europe? Rick Harnish, of US campaign group High Speed Rail Alliance, says it is at least good to see the first two schemes being built. ""The first is the San Francisco to Los Angeles route,"" he explains. ""That's an incredibly challenging route to build because of the mountains in California. ""Then there's Las Vegas to Los Angeles, a relatively easy project to build, as it is flat land."" In addition, there are plans for a HSR line from Portland in Oregon to Seattle in Washington State, and onto Vancouver in Canada. And another between Dallas and Houston. Yet Mr Harnish warns that planning efforts for the former are ""moving slowly"", while the Texas line is now more doubtful after President Trump's government cancelled a $63.9m (£48m) grant. By marked contrast, the total length of China's HSR network will reportedly exceed 50,000 km (31,000 miles) this year. Meanwhile, the European Union has 8,556 km of HSR lines, led by Spain's 3,190 km. In the UK, the only current HSR line is High Speed 1, the 68 miles link between the Channel Tunnel and London St Pancras. But High Speed 2 continues to be constructed from London Euston to Birmingham, despite well-publicised funding issues. While there is no universally agreed definition on what constitutes HSR, global railways trade group International Union of Railways says that trains generally need to be moving at more than 250 km/h (155 mph). So why does US lag behind Europe and especially China? ""We're a very car-addicted nation,"" says American rail industry journalist and author Will Doig. ""There's lots of people who just don't think we need it, or don't really want it coming through their area. ""And the US government has really shown a willingness to shut down investment in a lot of projects, especially rail."" Further complicating the situation in the US is that the boss of the government-owned passenger train service Amtrak, Stephen Gardner, resigned last month. It was widely reported that he stood down after pressure from the White House. Amtrak currently does not operate any HSR trains. Later this year it is due to enter 28 new 160mph NextGen Acela trains into service on its Northeast Corridor route between Boston and Washington DC. However, only around 50 miles of the 457-mile line can presently allow trains to travel at more than 150mph. Amtrak is not involved in the high-speed lines being built in California and Nevada. The LA to San Francisco project, called California High-Speed Rail, is being led by the state of California, and due to be completed by 2033. The line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Brightline West, is a privately-run project. It is expected to open in 2028. Globally, there are 23 nations with HSR, according to Mr Harnish. His non-profit organisation has the sole mission of bringing it to the US. Allowing HSR trains to run safely is far from straightforward, he adds. ""You can't have any crossings with highways, it needs to be very straight and a sealed corridor."" In China the country is still building more and more HSR lines, with the total distance expected to reach around 60,000km by 2030. Chinese cities that get HSR links see their economies increase by 14.2%, according to data from Denmark-based think tank 21st Europe. Chinese firms are also helping to build HSR systems in other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Will Doig, who wrote a book called High-Speed Empire, Chinese Expansion, and the Future of Southeast Asia, says that China is not just interested in helping its neighbours improve their rail networks. ""It is a way of China spreading its influence across a region that it felt was geopolitically strategic,"" he says. ""In some of these cases, countries have taken out loans from China so that China can then build the railways."" He warns that this may put them ""in a position where they're beholden to China"". Europe's growing HSR network is testament to the continent's history of investing in its public infrastructure, says Kaave Pour from 21st Europe. His think tank is now calling for further expansion of HSR, so that it connects most capitals and main cities in the EU, and those in the UK. Mr Pour says that if the US wants to develop HSR it needs to start with a cultural shift, a move towards more public transport, and asking itself ""what type of future does it want?"". Mr Harnish from the High Speed Rail Alliance says that in order for HSR to work in the US, ""the federal government is an essential component"". Yet as already flagged, the White House has pulled the plug on giving the planned high-speed line between Houston and Dallas a federal grant. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the project as a ""waste of taxpayers' money"". Scott Sherin is an executive at French train manufacturer Alstom. His firm is suppling Amtrak's new high-speed trains, but he questions whether the US has the political will ""to spend the public purse on rail versus other modes of transportation"". He also notes that any future HSR lines would struggle to get into city centres such as Dallas and Houston, because there are too many buildings. ""The issue is that the cities are so densely built [in their centres]"". Will Doig says that going forward he would love to see China helping to build more HSR in the US, but that he is not holding his breath. ""It's politically very difficult,"" he says. ""Which is too bad because without the animosity between the US and China, you could see how a partnership between them could really create great things for America, that America is not so good at building itself."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx415erwkwo","Global growth forecast slashed by IMF over tariff impact",2025-04-22,"Nick Edser","Business reporter, BBC News","The forecast for US economic growth for this year has been given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by trade tariffs. Growth is now expected to be 1.8% this year, down from the IMF's estimate of 2.7% for the US in January. The sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a ""significant slowdown"" in global growth, the Fund predicts. The forecast for the UK has also been cut, with the economy now expected to grow by 1.1% this year. But the IMF has predicted UK economic growth will be stronger than Germany, France, and Italy. Inflation in the UK, however, will be the highest in the world's advanced economies, at 3.1% this year, largely due to higher bills, including for energy and water. The predictions come as top economic policymakers gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank. IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the global economy ""still bears significant scars"" from the ""severe shocks of the past four years"". ""It is now being severely tested once again,"" he added. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said he had ""no intention of firing"" Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell after heavily criticising him. Concerns that Trump may try to sack Powell sparked a sell-off in markets in recent days. Trump has made a flurry of announcements on tariffs this year - taxes charged on goods brought into the US from other countries. In a growing trade war, the US has placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, while China has hit back with 125% levies on US products. The US has also introduced a 10% tax rate on goods from the vast majority of other countries, while pausing much higher rates for dozens of nations for 90 days. Trump says tariffs will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country. However, the IMF highlighted the potential negative impact on global trade given that modern supply chains are so interlinked. Uncertainty around trade policy was a ""major factor"" behind the growth downgrades, Mr Gourinchas said. ""Faced with increased uncertainty... many firms' initial reaction will be to pause, reduce investment and cut purchases."" The IMF predicts the global economy will grow by 2.8% this year, down from its previous forecast of 3.3%, and by 3.0% in 2026. The downgrade to the US growth forecast was due to greater policy uncertainty, trade tensions and slower than expected consumer spending, the IMF said. Tariffs are also expected to hit growth in 2026. The IMF said there was now a 40% probability of a US recession this year, higher than its estimate of 25% in October last year. Earlier on Tuesday, banking group the Institute of International Finance said it expected ""a shallow recession"" in the US later this year, with negative growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2025. China is expected to grow by 4% this year, down from the IMF's previous estimate of 4.6%. In the UK, the downward revision reflects the impact of tariffs, higher government borrowing costs, and weaker consumer spending as a result of higher bills and energy costs.  However, the IMF's 2025 prediction for the UK is now close to the 1% growth forecast by the government's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) last month. The IMF expects the UK to grow by 1.4% next year. Responding to the forecast, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it showed the UK was still the fastest growing European G7 country due to ""reform which will drive up long-term growth in the UK"". Reeves added that ""the world has changed"" and she would be in Washington this week ""defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade"". However, Mel Stride, the Conservative shadow chancellor, said the IMF outlook was ""a worrying indictment of Labour's economic approach"". ""The IMF has downgraded the UK's growth forecast, raising serious concerns about the lack of confidence and direction under Labour. They have also revised up significantly their forecast for inflation,"" he said. The IMF's World Economic Outlook also contains the following forecasts: Forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth, and the IMF acknowledged its latest predictions had been particularly challenging. The figures given are what the IMF calls its ""reference forecast"" based on the situation as at 4 April, which was two days after Trump's announcement of wide-ranging tariffs. Mr Gourinchas said that while the reference forecast was the IMF's central scenario, ""many possible paths exist, reflecting the unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the varied impact of tariffs across different countries"". The IMF also looked at the situation after the US temporarily suspended many tariffs while raising those on China sharply.   Mr Gourinchas said the tariff pause did not ""materially"" change the global outlook from its reference forecast, because the overall effective tariff rate of the US and China remains high and uncertainty about the policy continues."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrveyj87l5o","Company bosses warn over tariffs impact",2025-04-25,"João da Silva","Business reporter, BBC News","Top executives at well-known US firms are warning about the impact that tariffs are having on their companies and the wider economy. Technology giant Intel, footwear maker Skechers and consumer goods firm Procter & Gamble, have either cut their profit forecasts or withdrawn them citing economic uncertainty. US President Donald Trump has been trying to rebalance relations with key trading partners by using steep tariffs to bring them to the negotiating table. No new trade agreements between the US and other countries have been announced yet but there have been signs of progress in talks with South Korea. ""The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown with the probability of a recession growing,"" said Intel's chief financial officer, David Zinsner, during a call with investors.   ""We will certainly see costs increase,"" he added as the California-based firm announced gloomy profit and revenue forecasts. Intel's shares dropped by more than 5% in extended trading after those remarks. Beyond the technology industry, footwear maker Skechers also disappointed investors. The firm's shares fell after it withdrew its annual results forecast.  ""The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success,"" Skechers' chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call. Skechers - like rivals Nike, Adidas and Puma - uses factories in Asia, particularly in China, to make its products. Comments from Procter & Gamble (P&G) executives also hinted at how tariffs could mean higher prices for its customers. The maker of Ariel, Head & Shoulders and Gillette said it was considering changes to its prices to make up for the extra cost of materials sourced from China and other places. It also said it expected sales to grow this year less than previously forecast. ""We'll be looking for every opportunity to mitigate the impact,"" said Andre Schulten, P&G's financial chief, adding that there will be adjustments to ""some level of consumer pricing"". The Japanese owner of the 7-Eleven convenience stores, Seven & I, said it is also feeling the impact of the trade tensions. North America account for more than 70% of its sales.  Its incoming chief executive, Stephen Dacus, told the BBC about the uncertainty faced by the business. ""We don't know what those tariffs are going to be. We've seen some news recently where they have changed quite a bit so it's a little bit difficult to understand what the ultimate effect is,"" he said. ""Lowering prices and lowering quality typically doesn't work... so what you have to do... is find ways to maintain quality while bringing the cost down"". They join a growing list of examples of companies around the world that have warned about the impact of Trump's trade policies. South Korean car making giant Hyundai announced on Friday that it has set up a task force to find ways to deal with the fallout from tariffs. ""We expect a challenging business outlook to continue due to intensifying trade conflicts and other various unpredictable macroeconomic factors,"" it said. It added that it is considering moving some manufacturing out of South Korea. The firm has already shifted some production from Mexico to the US, which accounts for about a third of its global sales. Meanwhile, there were signs that talks on Thursday between US and South Korean trade officials in Washington DC, aimed at removing tariffs, have been positive.  US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the two sides had a ""very successful"" meeting. ""We may be moving faster than I thought, and we will be talking technical terms as early as next week,"" he told reporters after the meeting. South Korea's industry minister, Ahn Duk-geun, who also took part in the talks, echoed Bessent's optimism and added that they are working toward a ""July package"". A 90-day pause on higher tariffs affecting dozens of countries is set to expire on 8 July. Trump has said more than 70 countries have reached out to start negotiations since the tariffs were announced."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy70y2x3xj6o","The record-breaking tunnel being built from Denmark to Germany",2025-04-22,"Adrienne Murray","Business reporter","A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe. Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel. It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together. The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark. The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called ""elements"". ""It's a huge facility here,"" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel. To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.  Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France – burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks. ""We are breaking records with this project,"" says Mr Vincentsen. ""Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale."" With a price-tag around €7.4bn ($8.1bn; £6.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with €1.3bn from the European Commission. It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying. Once completed, the journey between Rødbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage. Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a ""greener"" shortcut for freight and passengers. ""It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,"" states Mr Vincentsen. ""Everybody's a winner,"" he claims. ""And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport."" Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead. ""So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,"" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element. There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor. At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. ""As you can hear, it's quite thick,"" he says tapping on the metal.  ""When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here."" Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats. Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision. ""We have to be very, very careful,"" emphasises Mr Wede. ""We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place."" Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes. With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark. A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration. ""There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,"" he adds. ""But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there."" So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. ""They looked at it and said, ""Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel."" Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact. One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise. However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead. ""We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,"" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock. When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day. According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  ""Ultimately, the users are going to pay,"" he says. It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions. ""The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,"" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. ""They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area."""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygdv47vlzo","US sets tariffs of up to 3,521% on South East Asia solar panels",2025-04-22,"João da Silva","Business reporter, BBC News","The US Commerce Department has announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on imports of solar panels from four South East Asian countries. It comes after an investigation that began a year ago when several major solar equipment producers asked the administration of then-President Joe Biden to protect their US operations.  The proposed levies - targeting companies in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam - are in response to allegations of subsidies from China and the dumping of unfairly cheap products in the US market. A separate US government agency, the International Trade Commission, is due to reach a final decision on the new tariffs in June. The countervailing and anti-dumping duties, as these tariffs are known, vary between companies and the countries their products are made in. Some solar equipment exporters in Cambodia face the highest duties of 3,521% because of what was seen as a lack of cooperation with the Commerce Department investigation. Products made in Malaysia by Chinese manufacturer Jinko Solar faced some of the lowest duties of just over 41%. Another China-based firm, Trina Solar, faces tariffs of 375% for the products it makes in Thailand. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment from BBC News. In recent years, many Chinese firms have moved operations to South East Asia in a bid to avoid tariffs imposed since the start of US President Donald Trump's first term. The US Commerce Department's findings were welcomed by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee - a group of manufacturers that called on the US government to launch the investigation. ""This is a decisive victory for American manufacturing and confirms what we've long known: that Chinese-headquartered solar companies have been cheating the system,"" said Tim Brightbill, lead counsel to the Alliance. In 2023, America imported almost $12bn (£8.9bn) in solar equipment from the four countries, according to US Census Bureau figures. While the planned tariffs are likely to help US solar panel manufacturers, they could also mean extra costs for businesses and consumers who have benefited from the availability of cheaper solar products. The levies would be imposed on top of other tariffs already rolled out by the Trump administration. The planned tariffs were announced just days after Chinese President Xi Jinping completed a tour of Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia. The trip was aimed to boost ties with the region and encourage those nations to resist what he called ""unilateral bullying"" by the US. Trump has so far imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July. His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to ""fight to the end""."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewdy2zw3go","US tariffs will make global trade shrink, says WTO",2025-04-16,"Charlotte Edwards","Business reporter, BBC News","The World Trade Organization (WTO) has forecast that global trade will fall this year because of US President Donald Trump's tariffs. It added ""severe downside risks"", including reciprocal tariffs and political uncertainty, could lead to an even sharper decline in global goods trade.  ""The decline is expected to be particularly steep in North America,"" the WTO said, forecasting trade to drop by more than a tenth in that region. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO director general, called the ""decoupling"" of the US and China ""a phenomenon that is really worrying to me"". The WTO previously expected global goods trade to expand by 2.7% in 2025 but it now forecasts it will fall by 0.2%. Chief economist Ralph Ossa said: ""Tariffs are a policy lever with wide-ranging, and often unintended consequences. ""Our simulations show that trade policy uncertainty has a significant dampening effect on trade flows, reducing exports and weakening economic activity,"" he added. Also on Wednesday, the UN trade and development body, UNCTAD, released its own report which forecasts global growth to slow to 2.3% in 2025 due to escalating trade tensions and uncertainty. It said the projection was below ""the 2.5% threshold widely viewed as signalling a global recession"". A baseline tariff of 10% on almost all foreign imports to the US kicked in on 5 April, although some countries and goods are exempt. China has a much higher tariff, which now totals 145% on most goods. The US stock market slid on opening on Wednesday with the big indexes falling amid the ongoing uncertainty. Despite the prediction of plunging trade with the US, the WTO expects some regions will still see trade growth. It said Asia and Europe were still projected to post modest growth in both exports and imports this year. ""The collective contribution to world trade growth of other regions would also remain positive,"" the WTO report said. For the first time, the report contains a forecast for services trade - which is when countries buy and sell services to each other instead of goods. This is common in industries such as tourism or finance where nothing physical is shipped but a service is provided. The WTO forecasts services trade to grow by 4% in 2025, which is around one percentage point less than expected. Since Trump's inauguration in January there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs. The US president says the import taxes will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country. However, critics say bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime. Trump has also backtracked on many of his announcements. Just hours after steep levies against roughly 60 of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those tariffs to all countries bar China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets. In March, the governor of the Bank of England has warned that Trump's tariffs could mean less money in UK consumers' pockets."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkvp6438ko","Trump proposes 80% China tariff ahead of trade talks",2025-05-09,"João da Silva","Business reporter, BBC News","US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting tariffs on goods from China, in his latest comment to signal interest in de-escalating the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.  ""80% Tariff on China seems right,"" Trump wrote on social media on Friday, ahead of trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland.  China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying also struck a confident note ahead of the meetings, saying Beijing had ""full confidence"" in its ability to manage trade issues with the US. Since returning to the White House, Trump has hit Chinese imports with 145% tariffs and China has retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods, driving down trade between the two nations. On Friday, official figures for April showed China's exports to the US fell by more than 20% compared to a year earlier. But at the same time its total exports rose by a better-than-expected 8.1%. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are ""under growing economic pressure"", Dan Wang from political risk consultancy Eurasia Group told the BBC. ""The recent signals from both sides suggest a transactional de-escalation is on the table"", she added. The announcement earlier this week of the talks was welcomed as an important first step towards easing tensions but analysts have warned that this marks the start of what are likely to be lengthy negotiations. ""The systemic frictions between the US and China will not be resolved any time soon,"" said former US trade negotiator, Stephen Olson. Any cuts to tariffs as a result of this meeting are likely to be ""minor"", he added. The initial negotiations will be led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier and economic tsar He Lifeng. But ""I think everyone recognises that any final deal will require the active engagement of both presidents,"" Mr Olson said.  Another trade expert said that even if the new tariffs imposed by Trump were lifted, the two countries would still have major issues to overcome. ""A realistic goal is probably at best a pullback from the sky-high bilateral tariffs but that would still leave in place high tariff barriers and various other restrictions"", the former head of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) China division, Eswar Prasad told BBC News. On social media on Friday, Trump called on China to ""open up its market"" to the US. He said any tariff reduction would be ""up to Scott B"".  In earlier remarks on Thursday, he had said he expected a ""very friendly"" meeting.  The talks between China and the US are set to take place just two days after the UK became the first country to strike a tariffs deal with the Trump administration.  The US agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, in exchange for new access to US beef and other exports, according to an outline of the new agreement. Countries around the world are scrambling to make similar deals before steep US import taxes are due to take effect next month. Trump announced what he called ""reciprocal tariffs"" on dozens of countries in April but paused them shortly afterwards for 90 days to give their governments time to negotiate with his administration. Businesses based in the US will also be watching events in Switzerland closely. Wild Rye, a women's outdoor clothing firm based in the state of Idaho, has manufacturing stations in China and has been severely affected by the tariffs.  The cost of shipping goods has jumped significantly, the firm's chief executive, Cassie Abel, told the BBC's Today programme. ""We have a purchase order that's incoming, which is around $700,000 [of goods] that's now costing £1.2m in levies up from £200,000,"" she said.

Trump said he has ""no intention of firing"" Jerome Powell after repeatedly criticising the head of the central bank, but added that he would like Powell to be ""a little more active"" on cutting interest rates. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump also said he was optimistic about improving trade relations with China.  He said the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".  The president's tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans. Trump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war. In his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be ""very nice"" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal.  Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was ""not a joke"". The trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed.  The Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised. Last week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him ""a major loser"". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses.  National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden. It is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so. Most major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%. That came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%.  US futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading. Investors feared that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise at a time when trade tariffs are already seen boosting inflation. Trade tensions between the world's biggest economies, as well as US tariffs on other countries around the world, have triggered uncertainty about the global economy. Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the forecast for US economic growth for this year was given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs. The sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a ""significant slowdown"" in global growth, the Fund predicted. Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July. His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to ""fight to the end"". The Chinese government has not yet officially responded to the latest statements from the Trump administration. However, an article in the state-controlled Global Times on Wednesday quoted commentators who said the remarks showed that the US is beginning to realise the tariffs do more harm than good to America's economy."

Alex Durand, chief executive of Saxon Air, said being able to unlock further growth and connectivity in clean innovation was a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"".  ""The region has the airspace, innovators and aviation expertise to enable this, making it ideally placed to advance the latest clean aviation technologies,"" he said. ""The strategy we're announcing can give rural communities better connectivity, inclusively unlock new skills, and raise aspirations by showcasing innovation and opportunities."" Saxon Air handles 45,000 passengers each year - many of them offshore workers - and said it wanted to focus more on sustainable travel. Its headquarters at Norwich Airport has a roof with 470 solar panels to help power its electric plane.  The company also has a drone platform, and John Dewing, director of operations,  believed developing this technology would ""future proof"" the company and ""push the boundaries"" in green innovation. SaxonAir hopes drones could be used to transport people around the county, cutting a journey from Norwich to King's Lynn from about 60 minutes to 15 minutes.  ""We fly helicopters so what's the next thing for a helicopter, a drone,"" Mr Dewing added.  ""We're trying to push the boundaries to tie up civil aviation with what is the private side, or the hobby side, to make it more of a viable project.""  However, Norfolk County Council said it wanted to see the government invest in the county and hoped it could become a ""leader rather than a follower"" in aviation innovation.  Chris Starkie, the council's director of growth and investment, said: ""[Norfolk] has the potential to be a leading centre, if not, the leading centre for research and development in new exciting aviation products. ""We are also branching out into areas like drone technology... I think we have the skills and the talent and the space, so it is the perfect combination.""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx17361pw1o","Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck",2025-04-18,"Annabelle Liang","Business reporter","Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California. While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports. Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.  Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.  But the comfort is short-lived. The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: ""NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',"" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated ""semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN"". The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.  The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two? China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.    Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers. Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.   It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones. As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.  Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into ""manufacturing superstars,"" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping. He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became ""the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,"" Mr Lin says. Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door. As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed ""iPhone City"". For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick. Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.  Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia. ""There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,"" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.  In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.  But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead. ""The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: ""President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops."" She added: ""At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible."" But many are sceptical of that.  The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is ""pure fantasy,"" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.  He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option. Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but ""really made an effort"" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.  ""The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China]."" Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans ""thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries"".  Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic. Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade. ""Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,"" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant. It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US. There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though. And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.  ""All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,"" Mr Friedman says. So what does Apple do now?  The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US. Now that ""Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,"" according to Mr Lin. Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales. And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma. Apple has announced a $500bn (£378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long. Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time. Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add ""pressure - both operationally and politically"" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly. ""Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,"" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.  ""But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.""

Spot gold touched $3,357.40 (£2,540) per ounce on Wednesday, before dipping from its peak. It has risen by around a third since the start of the year. The rise follows comments by the head of US central bank who said President Donald Trump's tariff policies are likely to mean slower growth, higher prices and unemployment risks. The precious metal is viewed as a safer asset for investors during times of economic uncertainty. At the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said higher-than-expected tariffs announced in recent weeks could result in slowing US economic growth and rising prices for consumers. Mr Powell gave his speech after a period of turmoil on global financial markets as investors reacted to the new import taxes coming into effect and the escalating trade war between the US and China. Gold is in ""full lifeboat mode"" as it has become ""the most crowded trade on the planet,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading and market strategy at SPI Asset Management. ""The dollar is stumbling under the weight of trade-policy whiplash, and portfolio managers have lost faith in anything that involves political discretion,"" he added. Analysts have compared this year's gold rally to the Iranian Revolution more than four decades ago, when prices jumped by almost 120% from November 1979 to January 1980. Gold crossed $3,000 an ounce for the first time last month as uncertainty over the impact of a global trade war set in. Jesper Koll from advisory firm Monex Group said investors have flocked to gold as ""a trust hedge against both inflation and government recklessness"". ""Everyone is looking for 'real' assets. It's increasingly clear that Team Trump's 'move fast and break things' approach to policy making will not change,"" he added. The introduction of tariffs by the Trump administration, which are taxes charged on businesses importing goods from overseas, has fuelled fears of inflation, which has driven investors to so-called safe haven assets like gold. Trump has put taxes of 145% on China since he returned to the White House in January, and China has retaliated with a 125% tariff on US imports. There is also uncertainty about whether sweeping US tariffs on a host of other countries will go into effect, after being paused for 90 days. The Trump administration has said the measures will bring manufacturing back to the US, create jobs for American workers and generate billions of dollars of tax revenues.

It said there was ""no such thing as a veto on Chinese investment"" in the deal.  The UK-US agreement rowed back on big hikes in tariffs on metals and cars imposed by President Donald Trump, but it also included conditions requiring the UK to ""promptly meet"" US demands on the ""security of the supply chains"" of steel and aluminium products exported to America.  Beijing fears this could see it being excluded from supplying US-bound goods to the UK, telling the Financial Times it was a ""basic principle"" that bilateral trade deals should not target other countries. At a regular press conference on Tuesday China's foreign ministry spokesperson was asked about the UK's trade agreements with the US and India.  Lin Jian said: ""As for the trade agreement... between the UK and relevant countries, I would like to point out that cooperation between countries should not target or harm the interests of third parties."" China is the world's second biggest economy and the UK's fifth biggest trading partner. In 2024 total bilateral trade hit £98.4bn. In response to the latest comments from China, the UK government said the agreement with the US was ""in the national interest to secure thousands of jobs across key sectors, protect British businesses and lay the groundwork for greater trade in the future"". Any ""external provisions"" in the agreement were ""not designed to undermine mutually beneficial economic relations with any third country"", it said. ""As the Chief Secretary to the Treasury clearly stated, there is no such thing as a veto on Chinese investment in this trade deal."" It added that ""trade and investment with China remain important to the UK.""  Under the UK-US deal Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods entering the US. But the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including steel and aluminium. The terms of the agreement say the UK will ""work to promptly meet US requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminium products intended for export to the United States and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities"". The US and China have been engaged in a tariffs war since the beginning of this year. The US buys much more from China ($440bn) than it sells to it ($145bn), which is something Trump has long been unhappy with. His reasoning in part for introducing tariffs, and higher ones on countries which sell more to the US than they buy, is to encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and boost manufacturing jobs. However, on Monday, Trump said talks over the weekend between the US and China had resulted in a ""total reset"" in terms of trade between the two countries, with tariffs either being cut or suspended on both sides.   The result is that additional US tariffs on Chinese imports - that's the extra tariffs imposed in this recent stand-off - will fall from 145% to 30%, while recently-hiked Chinese tariffs on some US imports will fall from 125% to 10%. The move is seen as helping to defuse the trade war between the world's two biggest economies. "

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ep2p19ep9o","UN's top court begins hearings on Israel's legal duties towards Palestinians",2025-04-28,"Anna Holligan","BBC News, Hague correspondent","The UN's top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has begun hearings for an opinion on Israel's legal duty to allow aid to Palestinians and to co-operate with the UN's Palestinian aid agency, Unrwa – both of which Israel has barred in Gaza. Israel stopped allowing aid into Gaza on 2 March, which it said was to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages. The UN and aid agencies say food and supplies are running out in Gaza, which Israel denies. Last year Israel severed ties with Unrwa, accusing it of colluding with Hamas. The hearings at The Hague are expected to last for five days, though a ruling could take many months. Ammar Hijazi, the Palestinian ambassador to International Organisations in The Hague, opened the hearings with a disturbing and graphic testimony.  He accused Israel of a ""genocidal campaign"" against the Palestinians, adding that Israel's ""crimes"" put Palestinians at risk of irreparable harm. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, at times his voice breaking, hands shaking, told the judges it has ""never been more painful to be Palestinian"". He said Israel was seeking ""deliberately to deprive the population in Gaza"" to ensure it has ""no way to survive"" and that people were ""trapped between death and displacement"". He described Unrwa as a ""shining example of multilateralism at the UN"" and called for a place where Palestinian families could be ""reunited in life rather than death"". In a statement coinciding with the start of the hearings, Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said it had decided ""not to take part in this circus"". ""It is another attempt to politicise and abuse the legal process in order to persecute Israel,"" he said. Israel won't be among the 39 countries speaking at the ICJ this week, but has provided a 37-page written submission to the court, in which it outlines the ways in which it claims Unrwa has been infiltrated by Hamas and argues that Israel is entitled to end cooperation with the organisation for the sake of its own security. The only countries likely to defend Israel in court are the US and Hungary. At issue are two bills passed by Israel's parliament in October that declared Unrwa harboured terrorists, and ordered the government to end all co-operation and contact with the organisation, including the supply of visas to Unrwa international employees.  Unrwa has challenged Israel's allegation that it knowingly has Hamas members in its ranks, or that it co-operated with the armed group. The focus of these hearings is to aid the judges in answering the question posed by the UN General Assembly, specifically whether Israel acted unlawfully in overriding the immunities and privileges of a UN body. But with statements live-streamed around the world from the Peace Palace, home to the ICJ in the Hague - the process is being used to highlight the wider concerns and context. In December, a vast majority of countries at the UN General Assembly voted to get the ICJ involved for a definitive interpretation of the law and Israel's obligations. Since then, the humanitarian situation in Gaza has got worse. Two weeks after cutting off aid, a ceasefire which had offered some respite for Gazans since January collapsed when Israel resumed its military offensive. Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the end of the truce. The current Israeli blockade is the longest closure Gaza has ever faced. The UN says Israel - as an occupying power - is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no aid shortage. That's something disputed by a number of humanitarian relief organisations operating on the ground in Gaza. At the end of March, all 25 bakeries supported by the World Food Programme (WFP) there were forced to close after wheat flour and cooking fuel ran out. According to the UN, malnutrition is spreading. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) says there are also severe shortages of medicine, medical supplies and equipment for hospitals overwhelmed by casualties from the Israeli bombardment, and that fuel shortages are hampering water production and distribution. The WFP warned food prices had skyrocketed by up to 1,400% compared to during the ceasefire, and the shortages of essential commodities raised serious nutrition concerns for vulnerable populations, including children under five, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the elderly. Earlier this month, the head of Unrwa said a ""man-made famine"" was ""tightening its grip"" across Gaza. Human rights groups argue that Israel is using the aid blockade as a form of collective punishment and as political leverage in hostage release negotiations. Hamas is holding 59 hostages, taken when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. Israel responded with a massive military campaign, which has killed at least 52,243 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. France, Germany and the UK described the blockade as ""intolerable"" and condemned as unacceptable remarks by the Israeli Defence Minister, Israel Katz, linking the supply of aid to political pressure on Hamas. The Israeli foreign ministry said more than 25,000 lorries carrying almost 450,000 tonnes of aid had entered Gaza during the ceasefire, adding: ""Israel is monitoring the situation on the ground, and there is no shortage of aid in Gaza."" It also said Israel was not obliged to allow in aid because Hamas had ""hijacked"" supplies ""to rebuild its terror machine"". Hamas has previously denied stealing aid and the UN has said it has kept ""a very good chain of custody on all the aid it's delivered"". The WFP says more than 116,000 tonnes of food supplies - enough to feed one million people for up to four months - is positioned at aid corridors and is ready to be delivered as soon as Israel reopens Gaza's border crossings. Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Mansour, warned the judges that ""people are starving"" while ""food rots at the border"". The hearings represent the biggest test of Israel's compliance with international law since the ICJ's landmark rulings in January, March and June of 2024 that ordered it to take immediate steps to allow aid to enter Gaza unrestricted and unhindered. The UN has argued blocking Unrwa amounts to a violation of the Palestinians inalienable right to self-determination. The ICJ judges' advisory opinion is expected within months."

""President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US],"" says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank. ""He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing."" Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May. The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April. Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico. Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his ""America First"" agenda is delivering results. The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton. The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years. Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (£450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment. According to Ali Shihabi – a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government – a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip. ""These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods,"" says Mr Shihabi. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment fund (PIF), which controls assets worth $925bn, already has numerous investments in the US. These include Uber, gaming firm Electronic Arts, and electric car firm Lucid. Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington. Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken ""with a little bit of a grain of salt"". Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items. These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft. The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen. The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder. The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction. Mr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a ""more efficient procurement system"", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily. ""The Trump administration is initiating procedures to facilitate those deals. So, it's expected that this process will improve immediately,"" he adds. Artificial intelligence is the other topic that will dominate the agenda during Mr Trump's visit. Talks are expected to centre on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms, and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been investing billions of dollars into tech and AI sectors as they try to diversify their economies away from oil. The Emiratis, in particular, are keen to establish themselves as a global AI hub. Last week, the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era chip regulations that placed restrictions on exports of advanced US chips to more than 120 countries including the Gulf states. The White House is expected to draft new rules that would potentially involve direct negotiations with countries like the UAE. ""For the UAE, this is absolutely essential,"" says Ms Young. ""They are aggressively building out their AI capacity. So, for them getting access to US technology is imperative to be the best."" While much attention will be on Trump courting Gulf capital for the US, Saudi Arabia is equally focused on drawing American investment into its ambitious Vision 2030 program. Led by giant construction projects, such as the building of a linear city called The Line, Vision 2030 is central to the Saudi government's continuing efforts to diversify the country's economy away from oil. It also involves pouring resources into entertainment, tourism, mining and sports. However, foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia declined for a third straight year in 2024, reflecting persistent challenges in attracting overseas capital. The fall in global oil prices since the start of the year has further strained Riyadh's finances, increasing pressure to either raise debt or cut spending to sustain its development goals. Oil prices tumbled to a four-year low amid growing concerns that a trade war could dampen global economic growth. The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output. Saudi Arabia is part of that group, and some commentators said that the rise was in part a desire to please Trump, who has called for lower oil prices. Other analysts said the reason was more that Opec+ remains confident that the global economy is growing. The US-Saudi Business Council, is an organisation that aims to boost trade ties between the two countries. It is hoping that Trump's visit will push American businesses to explore more opportunities in Saudi Arabia, especially in sectors like AI, healthcare and education. ""The Saudi government is looking heavily to invest in these sectors. There is a very big appetite for Saudi companies to collaborate with American companies,"" Hutham Al Jalal, who heads the Riyadh office for the organisation, tells the BBC. Saudi officials are said to be confident that some deals in these sectors will be secured during Trump's visit. For Saudi Arabia, Trump's visit is about strengthening ties with their longest-standing Western ally - a relationship that grew strained during the Biden years. For President Trump, it is about landing investment deals that can be framed as a win for his economic agenda. ""President Trump is looking for a headline of big investments in America, and he will get that from this trip,"" adds Mr Shihabi."

A video shared on social media showed Mr Cohen being escorted from the building by police with his hands tied behind his back. ""Congress kills poor kids in Gaza by buying bombs, and pays for it by kicking kids off Medicaid in the US,"" he said in a video after someone asked why he was ""getting arrested"". A police spokesperson said that Mr Cohen was charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding - a misdemeanour offence often used in civil disobedience cases in the US capital. Six other demonstrators were also arrested at the hearing and face charges including assaulting a police officer and/or resisting arrest. Ben & Jerry's has long been known for taking a public stance on social and political issues since it was founded in 1978 by Mr Cohen and Jerry Greenfield. It has often backed campaigns on issues like LGBTQ+ rights and climate change. Ben & Jerry's was bought by the multinational consumers goods giant Unilever in 2000. The merger agreement between the two companies created an independent board tasked with protecting Ben & Jerry's values and mission. But Unilever and Ben & Jerry's have been at loggerheads for a while. Their relationship soured in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's announced it was halting sales in the West Bank. The two companies are currently locked in a legal battle. In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for Unilever told BBC News: ""Ben Cohen takes stances as an activist citizen on issues he finds personally important. ""These actions are on his own as an individual and not on behalf of Ben & Jerry's or Unilever."" In March, Ben & Jerry's filed a legal case accusing Unilever of sacking chief executive David Stever over disagreements over the brand's political campaigns. At the time a Unilever spokesperson said it was ""disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public"". The dispute escalated over the last year as Ben & Jerry's advocated for a ceasefire in Gaza."

Andrew Watson captained Scotland to a 6-1 win over England on his debut in 1881. He had attended Crossley Heath School, on Skircoat Moor, before moving to Glasgow aged 18. Unveiling the plaque on Wednesday, England's first black international Viv Anderson said he had nothing but ""admiration"" for Watson. Watson was a ""pioneer"" and the first black footballer to play internationally for Scotland, but for more than a century the significance of his achievements went ""unrecognised"", according to BBC Sport.  He was born in Guyana in 1856 to a black woman who had been born into slavery and a white Scottish solicitor. Watson's family, though, were wealthy and among his ancestors was John Gladstone, one of the largest slave owners in the West Indies and the father of British Prime Minister William Gladstone. Mr Anderson said: ""He must have been very strong-willed, back in the 1800s it must have been quite difficult for him. ""And he got through it and did very well. I've got nothing but admiration for him."" Watson moved to Britain aged about two and was educated at some of the ""finest schools in England"", according to BBC Sport. Llew Walker, who wrote a book about Watson, said he had played rugby at school in Halifax before moving to Scotland to go to university. ""At that time Scotland were constantly beating England at football,"" the author said. ""They had developed a whole new style of football.  ""Watson learned that, came to England and merged what made Scotland great - and from that the modern game was born."" It was in Scotland that he would become a leading player and respected talent. Watson three times won the Scottish FA Cup and played three times internationally for Scotland winning on each occasion. After a second victory, winning 5-1 at the original Hampden Park, the English Football Association was convinced of a need to change its approach to the game. Watson moved back to England and was recruited to play for leading amateur team Corinthians, based in London. He later played for FC Bootle before retiring from the sport. Watson died in 1921, aged 64. At the plaque unveiling in Halifax, Dean Jones, head teacher at the school, said pupils had been able to connect to Watson's story. ""We are a really diverse school, so being able to champion your own heritage, to have a positive influence, to be excellent, students can relate to that. ""And to have a sporting icon associated with the school makes us all really proud."" Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North."

The Soyuz MS-26 space capsule carrying Pettit and his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner made a parachute-assisted landing in Kazakhstan's steppe at 06:20 local time (01:20 GMT) on Sunday. They spent 220 days on board the International Space Station (ISS), orbiting the Earth 3,520 times, the US space agency Nasa said. For Pettit - who has now spent a total of 590 days in space - it was his fourth mission.  Still, he is not the oldest person to fly in orbit - that record belongs to John Glenn, who aged 77 flew on a Nasa mission in 1998. He died in 2016. Pettit and the two Russian cosmonauts will now spend some time readjusting to gravity. After that, Pettit - who was born in Oregon on 20 April 1955 - will be flown to Houston in Texas, while Ovchinin and Vagner will go to Russia's main space training base in Zvyozdniy Gorodok (Star City) near Moscow. Before their departure from the ISS, the crew handed command of the spaceship to Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi. Last month, two Nasa astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, finally returned to Earth after spending more than nine months on board the ISS - instead of the initially planned just eight days. They flew to the ISS in June 2024 - but technical issues with the spacecraft they used to get to the space station meant they were only able to return to Earth on 18 March this year."

The project is an expansion of Maria 01, a co-working and event space for entrepreneurs and investors, as well as larger corporations that want to collaborate with tech start-ups. Its existing facilities across the street already house around 240 start-ups. They are spread across six buildings that used to make up the city's first hospital, founded in the 19th Century and notorious in Helsinki for treating patients with the plague. Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups. ""The whole place is really based on community,"" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. ""We bring people together so they can network… and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses."" There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna. ""We wouldn't be a proper start-up hub if we didn't have our own sauna here!"" laughs Ms Runeberg. While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region. It is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than €6m ($6.7m; £5.2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016. Ms Runeberg believes it will become the biggest start-up campus in Europe following the completion of three new buildings by 2028, adding a 50,000 sqm floor area. Later this year it is launching an accelerator programme designed to support and guide high-growth start-ups.  The hub's current and former members have already collectively raised over €1bn in funding. This represents around 40% of all early stage funding raised annually by Finnish start-ups. Ruben Byron is the Belgian co-founder of a start-up offering cloud services to AI developers. He has already scaled his business from a handful of staff using the hub's hot desks to a team of around 40 working from private offices in the former hospital, as well as remotely.  ""That has been a great experience, that we've kind of been able [to] be nurtured here in a way,"" he says. Although not as mature – or well known globally – as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Finland has been steadily making a name for itself in the tech scene over the last two decades. The small Nordic nation, which has a population of around 5.6 million, has spawned 12 unicorn businesses – firms worth a billion dollars or more – including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura, game developers Supercell, Rovio (the creators of the Angry Birds game), and food delivery platform Wolt. Last year, Startup Blink, a global index mapping more than 100 countries ranked Finland's start-up ecosystem the 7th best in western Europe, and 14th in the world. The index cites factors including hubs like Maria 01, alongside high levels of state and university support, and Slush - a huge annual non-profit gathering for global start-ups and investors. It also highlights Finland's transparent and open business culture. ""There is an authenticity with the Finns,"" says Jack Parker, a Helsinki-based founder originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, who runs a healthcare innovation start-up.  ""Ego doesn't really play a part. So if I reach out to somebody, it's quite likely eight out of 10 times that they will respond."" Finland's right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in its official government programme that it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem. ""It's not just about rankings,"" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation. In 2024 Business Finland alone invested €112m in start-ups, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year. ""The real goal is to create an environment where our ground-breaking start-ups can emerge and really tackle global challenges."" The agency hopes this will help drive growth in the Finnish economy, which went into recession in 2023 and is currently making a sluggish recovery, with the Bank of Finland forecasting an increase of less than 1% this year. The country is also trying to attract more global talent by offering start-up permits for international founders who want to grow their businesses in Finland. These entrepreneurs are eligible for a so-called soft-landing support package provided by Business Finland. ""They give you advice, support, sometimes grants to support the initiation phase,"" explains Lalin Keyvan, a Turkish-born entrepreneur at Maria 01 who says the scheme was one of the main reasons why she relocated to Helsinki. Business Finland's marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there's free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare. ""You don't really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,"" says Ms Ilmari. But whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe's more established start-up hubs is up for debate. Data suggests it still has a long way to go to catch up with neighbouring Sweden, long the Nordic darling of the European start-up scene. It is home to more than 40 unicorn businesses including Spotify, payments platform Klarna and game developer King. In Startup Blink's ecosystem ranking Sweden ranks second in Europe after the UK, and top in the EU. In the last decade it has attracted more than $29bn in funding compared to just over $8bn in Finland, according to the annual State of European Tech report by investment company Atomico. ""I love Finland's bold approach,"" says Charlotte Ekelund, deputy CEO of Sting, a non-profit organisation that helps develop start-ups in Stockholm. However she believes Finland is still years behind Sweden in terms of pulling in capital and developing its ecosystem. ""We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways."" Mikael Pentikainen, CEO of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, says the country's government is currently losing support amongst entrepreneurs despite its pro-start-up and pro-business approach. A recent survey for the organisation found 41% of small and medium-sized business owners are satisfied with the coalition's actions, down from 54% in June. One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a ""difficult but necessary"" move designed to stabilise public finances.  But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders. The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required to pass a test on Finnish society and culture if they want to settle long-term. Back at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he's confident Finland's start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs. ""The advantage of the ecosystem right now is this kind of 'small town, everybody knows each other' [feeling]. Scaling that up, there is the risk of actually losing that element of it."""

Rachel Reeves suggested that moving closer to the EU on trade was a bigger priority, despite her current focus on talks with the US. After her meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday, Reeves tweeted that both the UK and US want a deal that is ""in both our national interests"". Earlier this week, she signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports from their current 10% to 2.5% as part of a wider deal. The UK is preparing for a summit with the EU in May in an attempt to ""reset"" the relationship between the two. ""I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,"" she told the BBC. ""Obviously I've been meeting Scott Bessent this week whilst I'm in Washington, but I've also this week met the French, the German, the Spanish, the Polish, the Swedish, the Finnish finance ministers - because it is so important that we rebuild those trading relationships with our nearest neighbours in Europe, and we're going to do that in a way that is good for British jobs and British consumers."" A Downing Street spokesman said the chancellor's remarks had been ""a statement of fact that the EU is our largest trading partner"". The spokesman also highlighted comments that Sir Keir Starmer has made previously where he had said it was a ""false choice between the EU and the US"". Reeves said this week that the government is working ""flat out"" to secure a trade deal with the US. She has said she wants to see ""free and fair"" trade, and wants to deepen the relationship between the US and UK in areas such as technology. Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith told Sky News that his party would ""absolutely be seeking to prioritise"" a deal with the US over the EU. Griffith argued that the UK already had a tariff-free deal on goods with the EU, therefore the ""next best choice if you want to grow the economy after the chancellor's crashed it would be to get a deal with the US"". Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: ""The chancellor is absolutely right that our trading relationship with Europe is more important, but the government's approach so far shows these are little more than empty words. ""This government has bent over backwards to appease Donald Trump but barely lifted a finger to unleash growth by boosting trade with Europe."" Regarding the situation with the US, Reeves said she ""understands what President [Donald] Trump wants to address"" with his tariffs, ahead of talks with her US counterpart in Washington. Reeves said there were similarities with the way both the US and UK governments had come to power off the back of voter frustration with the economy. ""We're all grappling with this issue of tariffs but I think that there is an understanding why President Trump wants to address some of the global imbalances there are in the system,"" she said. Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US including from the UK. The UK also faces a broader tariff rate of 10% and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies – most of which are currently on pause until July. Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a ""good chance"" a trade deal could be reached with the UK. Reeves said she had also been working closely with European and Canadian counterparts to remove trade barriers, and that conversations around the table at G20 meetings this week had been difficult. ""Obviously there are strains. We are all following what's happening in our domestic bond markets, in our equity markets, and we all know that that uncertainty is bad for investment in the UK economy.""

An initiative to support the displaced Afghan players was announced by the ICC following its board meeting in Zimbabwe last weekend. However, as reported by ESPN Cricinfo,, external cricket's global governing body will not reduce or siphon off money earmarked for the ACB, even though part of the criteria for full membership of the ICC is to support women's cricket.  The ICC will support the Afghan women through a separate funding mechanism, while the ACB will continue to receive a payment believed to be in the region of £13m per year. All of that funding will go towards men's cricket in Afghanistan, with women's sport outlawed in the country since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. The ACB is the only full ICC member not to field a women's team. Instead, Afghanistan's women's cricketers will be funded by the ICC in conjunction with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), Cricket Australia and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). An Afghanistan Women's XI played an exhibition match in Melbourne in January and want to be recognised as a refugee team. But the ICC is understood to have acknowledged that the prospect of Afghanistan's women playing official international matches in the near future is a distant one as it would need to be sanctioned by the ACB. Afghanistan's women have been promised a robust high-performance programme offering ""advanced coaching, world-class facilities and tailored mentorship"" which the ICC hopes will ""help them reach their full potential"". Afghanistan's men's team have retained their Test status, reached the semi-finals of last year's T20 World Cup and participated in the Champions Trophy earlier this year. BBC Sport has approached the ACB for comment."

The international economic group said in its forecast for the world economy that global share prices have dropped ""as trade tensions flared"" and warned about an ""erosion of trust"" between countries. However, it stopped short of predicting a worldwide recession, saying ""our new growth projections will include notable markdowns, but not recession"". The comments come as leaders and businesses respond to US President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs announced on 2 April. Global stock markets plummeted following the announcement and many have not recovered since - with the FTSE 100 index of the largest firms listed in the UK still 4.6% lower than a month ago. Meanwhile, predictions of a global recession have risen as firms slash spending and investment amid the uncertainty and some countries respond to Trump with tariffs of their own. On Wednesday, the World Trade Organization (WTO) forecast that global trade will fall this year because of Trump's tariffs. It follows similar comments from the Bank of England, which has said that rising trade tensions from tariffs have ""contributed to a material increase in the risk to global growth"" and financial stability. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) said on Thursday it had reduced its key interest rate ""owing to rising trade tensions"". But the IMF's outlook is rosier by contrast. ""[This] is a call to respond wisely,"" said IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva on Thursday. ""A better balanced, more resilient world economy is within reach. We must act to secure it."" She added ""all countries must redouble efforts to put their own houses in order"" in response to the uncertainty. She specifically called on Europe to cut down on ""restrictions on internal trade in services"" and ""deepen"" its single market. She also said China needs to increase its social safety net so that there is less ""precautionary saving"" and said the US government needs to reduce its debt."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c4g975k4p3zo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The International Cricket Council is being lobbied to make T10 an officially recognised format in the future. Sources have told BBC Sport at least two full members are pushing for the ICC to consider granting List A status to T10 franchise domestic competitions. The inclusion of the format would enable the statistics from sanctioned T10 leagues and tournaments organised by full members to be included in a player's official averages. Discussions over the subject took place at the ICC's latest board meeting which is being held in Harare, Zimbabwe from 10 to 13 April. The issue was not listed as an official item on the agenda at the meeting, presided over by ICC chair Jay Shah, but was brought up on an informal basis. It was said to have gained little traction from the majority of those in attendance, but it is a topic which will be revisited should it garner further support. The ICC is responsible for the classification of official cricket, external and since 2007 has been responsible for the definition of List A, which is the limited overs format of the sport. Prior to 2007 the definition of List A matches and the application of the definition was overseen by the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. When approached by BBC Sport the ICC declined to comment. World Cricketers' Association chief executive Tom Moffat said the introduction of T10 as an officially recognised format was a ""likely natural progression for cricket"" but was ""not a priority issue"" for the global game. ""Cricket's leaders have the opportunity to make some holistic changes now to set our sport up for its future,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Our recently released global game structure report highlights and provides recommendations on the issues that we believe should be prioritised, based on player and other stakeholder feedback."" The first major T10 competition took place in December 2017 in the United Arab Emirates in what is now known as the Abu Dhabi T10.  The tournament has attracted some high-profile white-ball players since its inception and former England captain Jos Buttler participated in the 2024 edition. West Indies, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka have all staged domestic T10 tournaments. A men's T10 franchise tournament in Scotland was supposed be held last August but was called off after it was not cleared by the ICC. T10 has not been played at national team level by full member nations in either gender, but is seen as a valuable format for the growth and development of the game for those further down the ICC's rankings. The European Cricket Network, founded by Australia-born ex-Germany player Daniel Weston, have organised tournaments for representative national sides with matches streamed online."

""It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it. ""To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this work… it was just pulled."" Ms Deane's UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US. On Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta. This was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. ""We were obviously very excited about that,"" she says. So her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers. What added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months. Initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken. ""It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,"" she says. ""It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it."" Eventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page. In the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months. ""Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,"" says Ms Deane. According to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook. ""I would say that it is a massive problem,"" says Mr Borchgrevink. ""There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages."" His company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets ""10 to 15 clients per week"". ""But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort."" The BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined. However, it said in a statement, that ""we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details. ""We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure."" Hackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account. The final thing in that list happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows & Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US. He got locked out of the firm's social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta. Because his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (£900) to unlock the account. Unable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google. Thankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later. Mr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem. ""It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,"" he says. In fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse. He tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents. ""They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves. ""The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins."" He said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one. ""Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles. ""Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account."" The BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked. One small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone. Meanwhile, others, such as digital marketer Chetha Senadeera, say that Meta has wrongly closed business accounts. Last autumn he realised that a Facebook page he managed for a mobile bank had gone missing. ""It had just disappeared,"" he says. ""There was no notification to me or any of the team members. It was just gone. It was like it had been kidnapped, almost."" The page was a crucial gateway to customers across Europe for Lithuania bank MyTU. Mr Senadeera says that the customer support agents he spoke to at Meta, Facebook's owner, were baffled. He says they told him that they could see the page, but that it had been restricted, and that they couldn't unblock it. Six months later, and the page remains locked. Meta tells the BBC that the page had been removed for violating its scams policies, via a link on the page that was flagged by its systems as potentially harmful. Mr Senadeera disputes that the firm has ever posted any harmful or misleading content. He says that Meta needs to do more, and move more quickly, to help firms get their Facebook and Instagram pages back, whether they have been a victim of fraud or not."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrgpwg545o","Could South America benefit from Trump's trade tariffs?",2025-04-25,"Ione Wells","South America correspondent","When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief. Ten of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%. Only Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days. The exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US. Commentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers. While plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to. Here I'll set out this debate – starting with the potential upsides for the region. South America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production. The US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters. For example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US. There is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports. With the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat. These include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group. He tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was ""excellent for Brazilian agriculture"" as ""Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us"". However, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising ""bilateral barriers"" on commodities mostly just affects ""who sells to whom"", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally. So his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers. ""The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors… for example if there is a recession,"" he tells the BBC. Yet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US. Take the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports. Japan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America. Other Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market. Brazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia. Trump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US. This would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers. Meanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place.  The other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%. Uruguay's new President Yamandú Orsi has also said that Trump's tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America's bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality. He said that ""Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat"" in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners. You may have noted a lot of ""coulds"" and ""ifs"". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability. Whether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent. Firstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium. The US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%. Brazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  – bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry. Argentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers. ""We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,"" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald. Trump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export. Eduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a ""serious headwind"" for South America. Looking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump. After all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries. Mr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. ""If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil."" He theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America. So, calling Trump's tariffs a clear ""win"" or ""loss"" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%. As Mr Hallak says: ""It's very hard to predict where this is going."" Subject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods. But adds: ""I'm not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don't think so."" "
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c934qzd094wo","Asian stocks see their worst drop in decades after Trump tariffs",2025-04-07,"Peter Hoskins","Business reporter","Asia-Pacific stocks from Shanghai to Tokyo and Sydney to Hong Kong plunged on Monday by levels not seen in decades, as global markets continue to reel from US President Donald Trump's tariffs.   The Shanghai Composite was down more than 8% at one point, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped more than 13% and Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down by 7.8% - moves that one analyst described to the BBC as a ""bloodbath"". European markets too fell in early trading, with banks and defence firms seeing the biggest drops. This follows global slumps last week after Trump announced new tariffs between 10% and 46% on most countries.  This is a blow for Asia's manufacturing hubs that count the US as a key market for exports ranging from clothes to cars.  These include wealthy allies like Japan and South Korea, which face 26% tariffs, as well as developing countries like Vietnam that are bracing for a 46% levy - Trump called the fast-growing economy one of the ""worst offenders"".  Also on that unenviable list are Cambodia (49%), Thailand (36%) and China, which will face 54% tariffs in total.  Others like Singapore, New Zealand and Australia have already had a so-called baseline 10% tariff go into effect.  ""Asia is bearing the brunt of the US tariff hike. While there could be some room for negotiation, a new regime of higher tariffs is here to stay,"" Qian Wang, Asia Pacific chief economist at investment firm Vanguard. Asian economies are also particularly sensitive to fears that a global trade war could trigger a slowdown or even a recession in the US, the world's biggest economy. That, in turn, would further hurt Asian exports.  Slumps in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were exacerbated as investors caught up with the big falls seen in other markets on Friday as they were closed for public holidays. The Shanghai Composite closed 7.3% lower and Taiwan Weighted Index lost 9.7% - its biggest drop on record. The ASX 200 in Australia lost 4.2% and the Kospi in South Korea ended 5.6% lower. The Hang Seng closed 13.2% lower, its biggest drop since 2008.  ""Tariffs are feeding into expectations around inflation and a recession,"" said Julia Lee, head of client coverage at FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group. Goldman Sachs now forecasts there is a 45% chance the US will fall into recession in the next 12 months - up from a previous estimate of 35% - as the investment banking giant lowered its economic growth forecast for the country. Other Wall Street firms have also revised their recession forecasts in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a US and global economic downturn. ""This is negative to the global and Asia economy, especially those small open economies, both in the short term and long-term."" Countries from Vietnam to Bangladesh have become highly reliant on the US as an export market. Several major US brands produce goods in Vietnam, including Nike and Gap. Bangladesh exports $8.4bn (£6.5bn) of garments a year to the US, according to the trade body, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.  So Trump's announcement last week of a 37% tariff on Bangladesh is bad news for the South Asian nation. ""Asia is likely to feel a disproportionate brunt of this turmoil because Asia sends more exports to the US than to other markets,"" said Frank Lavin,  former undersecretary for international trade at the US Department of Commerce. Asia's biggest economy, China, has also hit back with its own tariffs, deepening the global stock market turmoil on Friday. All three major US stock indexes in fell by more than 5%, with the S&P 500 dropping almost 6%, capping the worst week for the US stock market since 2020. In the UK, the FTSE 100 plunged almost 5% - its steepest fall in five years, while exchanges in Germany and France faced similar declines. Ms Lee also highlighted that the global stock market rout looks set to continue: ""US futures trading lower point to another hard session on Wall Street tonight."" Global stock markets have lost trillions in value since Trump announced sweeping new 10% import taxes on goods from every country, with products from dozens of countries, including key trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam, facing far higher rates.

Born in the coastal resort of Acapulco, his parents took him to the US when he was just six months old. Growing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life. After his arrest in San Diego for gang activity, Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as President Trump was taking office, and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth. ""It was a shock. It still is,"" he admits. ""When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing.""  Alberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. ""Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],"" he reflects. In fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company – EZ Call Center – was looking for English-speakers. The work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved. ""I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,"" he tells me during a break between calls. Almost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz. He was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico. ""We are all dealing with culture shock,"" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls. ""We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too."" In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing. All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US. Daniel says that agents like Alberto – who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico – are among his most trusted employees. ""They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,"" he explains. Daniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions. As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation – called the Borderline Crisis Center – which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico. After his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls ""the largest deportation in American history"". He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California. Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees. So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing.  The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year.  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024. However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant ""encounters"" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years. The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors – from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador – may have acted as an effective deterrent. The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings. Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city. The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality. Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce.  With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys. ""What happened in the US stays in the US,"" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. ""We don't really do background checks on that."" Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate. ""We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,"" she explains. The ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start. He grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old. ""Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,"" Luis explains. While in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech. Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life. ""I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends."" For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with. ""From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,"" he adds. While the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months. If so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes. In Tijuana, many of them will find it at the end of a telephone line."

It comes as Xi is on a so called ""charm offensive"" trip across South East Asia, which will also see him visit Malaysia and Cambodia. Though the trip was long-planned, it has taken on heightened significance in the wake of a mounting trade war between the US and China. Vietnam was facing US tariffs of up to 46% before the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause last week. US President Donald Trump called Xi's meeting with Vietnamese leaders a ploy to figure out how to ""screw the United States of America"". According to state media outlet Xinhua, Xi told Vietnam's Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam to ""jointly oppose unilateral bullying"". ""We must strengthen strategic resolve... and uphold the stability of the global free trade system as well as industrial and supply chains,"" he said. Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, said Xi's comments were ""a very shrewd tactical move"". ""While Trump seems determined to blow up the trade system, Xi is positioning China as the defender of rules-based trade, while painting the US as a reckless rogue nation,"" he added. Speaking to reporters in the Oval office on Monday, Trump said he does not ""blame"" China or Vietnam but alleged that they were focused on how to harm the US. ""That's a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out, how do we screw the United States of America?"" said Trump.  The world's two largest economies are locked in an escalating trade battle, with the Trump administration putting tariffs of 145% on most Chinese imports earlier this month. Beijing later responded with its own 125% tariffs on American products coming into China. On Saturday, a US customs notice revealed smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices would be excluded from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China. But Trump later chimed in on social media saying there was no exemption for these products and called such reports about this notice false. Instead, he said that ""they are just moving to a different tariff 'bucket'"". Xi arrived in Hanoi on Monday, where he was welcomed by well wishers waving Chinese and Vietnamese flags. He then met top Vietnamese officials including the country's Secretary-General and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. Earlier on Tuesday, Xi visited the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum to take part in a wreath laying ceremony at the resting place of the former Vietnamese founder and Communist leader.  Despite Xi's visit, Vietnam will be careful to ""manage the perception that it is colluding with China against the United States, as the US is too important a partner to put aside,"" said Susannah Patton, Director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute think-tank. ""In many ways, China is an economic competitor as well as an economic partner for South East Asian economies,"" she added. Xi has now left Vietnam and will arrive in Malaysia later on Tuesday. He is expected to meet the country's King, as well as its Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. It comes as Malaysian mobile data service company U Mobile said it will roll out the country's second 5G network by using infrastructure technology from China's Huawei and ZTE. Ms Patton expects Xi to continue portraying the US as ""a partner which is unreliable [and] protectionist"". Meanwhile, he is likely to ""portray China in stark contrast as a partner that is there"", she added. ""Now is really a golden opportunity for China to score that narrative win. I think this is how Xi's visit to Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia will be seen."""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly517p1zgqo","US lays out plans to hit Chinese ships with port fees",2025-04-18,"Tom Espiner and Peter Hoskins","Business reporters, BBC News","The US has revealed plans to impose port fees on Chinese ships to try to revive shipbuilding in America and challenge China's dominance of the industry. From mid-October, Chinese ship-owners and operators will be charged $50 per ton of cargo with the fees increasing each year for the next three years. There have been concerns that the measures would further disrupt global trade after US President Donald Trump's raft of tariff policies, but the fee is less severe than originally suggested. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said the fees will raise prices for American consumers and ""will not revitalise the US shipbuilding industry"". The US Trade Representative (USTR) said: ""China has largely achieved its dominance goals, severely disadvantaging US companies, workers, and the US economy"". Fees on Chinese vessel owners and operators of ships built in China will be based on the weight of their cargo, how many containers they carry or the number of vehicles onboard. For affected bulk vessels, the fee will be based on the weight of their cargo, while the charge for container ships will depend on how many containers a vessel is carrying. The $50 per ton of cargo will rise by $30 a ton each year for the next three years. Fees on Chinese-built ships will start at $18 a ton or $120 per container and also rise over the next three years. Non-US built ships carrying cars will be charged $150 per vehicle. The fee will be applied once per voyage on affected ships and not more than five times a year. The USTR also decided not to impose fees based on how many Chinese-built ships are in a fleet or based on prospective orders of Chinese ships, as it had originally proposed. Empty vessels that arrive at US ports to carry bulk exports like coal or grain are exempted. Vessels that move goods between American ports as well as from those ports to Caribbean islands and US territories are also exempted from rules, as are US and Canadian ships that call at ports in the Great Lakes. The fees are much lower than a plan floated in February to charge up to $1.5m (£1.1m) for each American port a Chinese ship visits. The USTR said a second phase of actions will begin in three years to favour US-built ships carrying liquified natural gas (LNG). These restrictions will rise incrementally over the following 22 years. The announcement came as global trade is already being disrupted by Trump's trade tariffs, experts have said. Cargoes originally destined for ports in the US from China are instead being redirected to European ports, a trade group said. Businesses have warned this will raise prices for US consumers. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July. His administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. These tariffs have caused ""significant build ups"" of ships, especially in the European Union, but also ""significant congestion"" at UK ports, according to Marco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade. More containers are coming to the UK, he said. ""We've seen a lot of diversion of ships from China, that were due to head to the US, diverting and coming to the UK and into the EU."" In the first three months of 2025, Chinese imports into the UK have increased by about 15% and into the EU by about 12%. ""That's a direct impact of what President Trump is doing,"" he said, adding that uncertainty and increased disruption pushes up prices for consumers. Sanne Manders, president of logistics firm Flexport, said both tariffs and strikes at ports in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium in the first three months of the year had been ""clogging"" ports. Congestion in the UK ""is particularly severe in Felixstowe"", while in continental Europe Rotterdam and Barcelona are ""also pretty severe"". ""I do believe that if more cargo is going to be routed towards Europe, finding new buyers that will drive up the volumes even further, that could lead to more congestion,"" he said - although terminals would be open for more hours per day in the summer due to better weather. He said shippers were looking for new markets, but that also there may be a surge of goods to the US to try to take advantage of that 90-day window for goods from some countries. He said in the US, consumers would pay for the tariffs, but European consumers would not see ""much impact"". Companies would also probably start redesigning their supply chains, he said."

Ahmed Manasra, who is now 23, became a symbol of a wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence that began in 2015. Surveillance footage showed him and his 15-year-old cousin, Hassan, brandishing large kitchen knives in a Jewish settlement in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem. Hassan wounded a 13-year-old Israeli boy and an Israeli man before he was shot dead by police. Manasra's case has long been a focus of human rights groups. Amnesty International said he endured ""shocking ill-treatment"", including nearly two years of solitary confinement, causing him to develop serious mental illness. His lawyer, Khaled Zabarqa told the BBC he was freed after serving his sentence. Israelis saw the young age of Manasra and his cousin at the time of the attack as evidence that they had been indoctrinated by propaganda. After the stabbings, Manasra fled the scene and was hit by a car. A graphic video widely shared on social media showed him as he lay bleeding profusely on the street and an Israeli bystander jeered and heckled. This footage provoked outrage in the Arab world and many assumed the boy was dead. However, days later Israeli authorities published a photo of him being treated in hospital. Later, Manasra was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in jail.  Doctors say that he developed schizophrenia behind bars and tried to harm others and himself. Repeated legal appeals for his early release were denied on the grounds that he was convicted of a terrorist offence. Since his release, his family has declined to speak to journalists. ""Until now, Ahmed's health state is unknown, and the family's priority is to diagnose and treat him and follow up on his health situation to lessen the side-effects that Ahmed might face,"" Khaled Zabarqa said. Amnesty International and the Israeli NGO, Adalah, accuse the Israeli authorities of breaches of international law throughout Manasra's case. They point to his interrogation at age 13 - without a guardian or lawyer present.   Leaked video showed Israeli security staff shouting and insulting him as he became visibly distressed. ""Manasra's rights were systematically stripped since his imprisonment. He has only been allowed to see his immediate family through a glass wall, without any physical contact,"" Adalah said in a statement. ""He has been completely denied the right to education and stripped of other basic rights. His right to dignity was violated, including through two years spent in solitary confinement, and his right to health was disregarded due to ongoing medical neglect by the Israel Prison Service."" The prisons service says that all detainees are held in accordance with international law and that any allegations of abuse are investigated. Recently released Palestinian prisoners say that conditions inside Israeli jails have become much harsher since the deadly Hamas-led assault on southern Israel in October 2023, which triggered the Gaza war. Many of those freed during the recent ceasefire in Gaza appeared thin and sick, and some needed immediate hospital treatment.   They have described beatings, severe overcrowding, insufficient medical care, scabies outbreaks, and poor sanitary conditions. Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has boasted of ordering tight restrictions on security prisoners. Last month, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy from the occupied West Bank who was held in an Israeli jail for six months without charge died after collapsing, in unclear circumstances.  Walid Khalid Ahmed became the first Palestinian child to die in Israeli detention. An Israeli doctor who observed the post-mortem examination found that he was suffering from extreme malnutrition."

The University of Exeter said the scheme paired older people in Exmouth with international students. Dr Yuxi Heluo, assistant professor at the University of Exeter Business School, said the project aimed to get the elderly to share their ""life wisdoms and experience"", while the students helped them learn how to use items such as phones, tablets and laptops. She added: ""This helps the older people with things like checking NHS records or buying groceries online."" The government's University Mental Health Charter found that 90% of students in the UK considered themselves lonely. This was one of the reasons Dr Heluo set up the project. But, as well as fighting loneliness, it has had bonus outcomes, such as true friendships. Sue Wright said her student Jessie regularly went to stay with her. She said: ""Though we're generations apart, we have lots in common."" Two of the other members of the project, Christine Chittock and Pam Hampson, found it broke the stereotypes they held about students. Ms Chittock said: ""It gave us the opportunity to see that students aren't just always on their phones."" ""Or out drinking and partying,"" Ms Hampson added.  Members of the group said they had found this year to be a great success but would like to see the exchange taken further next time. Mary Latham and Natalie Leung were paired up for this academic year. Ms Latham said: ""Not only could she teach me about the computer, she could have cooked me a meal as well."" Ms Leung said Mary was going to cook her a Sunday roast as she as never had one. She added: ""I think it is really nice to share food."" Follow BBC Devon on X, Facebook and Instagram.

Answering questions in the Commons on Monday, Lammy twice stated Israel's 16-day blockade preventing humanitarian supplies into Gaza was a ""breach"" of international law. This led to the prime minister's official spokesperson reconfirming that the government's position is Israel was ""at risk"" of breaching humanitarian law. Lammy told Bloomberg it was a ""matter for the court"" to decide if international law had been broken. Asked if he regretted his statement, Lammy said it was ""difficult to see how denying humanitarian assistance to a civilian population can be compatible with international humanitarian law"". The row over his comments came as Israel launched its biggest wave of air strikes on Gaza since the ceasefire began.  The Hamas-run health ministry said over 400 people had been killed, with Benjamin Netanyahu warning it was ""just the beginning"". Since 2 March, Israel has stopped all food, fuel and medicine entering Gaza in an attempt to force Hamas into offering new concessions. Asked about the aid blockade by Labour MP Dr Rupa Huq, Lammy said on Monday: ""This is a breach of international law. Israel quite rightly must defend its own security. But we find the lack of aid – it's now been 15 days since aid got into Gaza -unacceptable, hugely alarming and very worrying. ""We urge Israel to get back to the number of trucks we were seeing going in - way beyond 600 - so that Palestinians can get the necessary humanitarian support they need at this time."" Lammy told MPs he was ""a little jetlagged"" having returned to the UK from a G7 meeting in the US only hours before his Commons appearance. Later in the same debate, ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pressed Lammy to call Israel's aid blockade and bombing of the Gaza Strip a breach of international law. Lammy said: ""I did say in my contribution that Israel is in breach of international humanitarian law.  ""The decision that I made back in September to suspend arms sales, which was largely because of that breach."" He was referring to the government freezing 30 arms export licenses to Israel after a review ordered by Lammy found a ""clear risk"" they could be used in violations of international humanitarian law. Asked about Monday's comments that appeared to go further, the prime minister's official spokesperson said: ""Our position remains that Israel's actions in Gaza are at clear risk of breaching international humanitarian law, and we continue to call the government of Israel to abide by its international obligations."" They added: ""The government is not an international court, and, therefore, it is up to courts to make judgments."" Asked whether the foreign secretary had mistakenly gone beyond official government policy, the spokesperson said: ""I'd refer to the Foreign Office on that, but there's no change in policy here."" Asked whether Lammy should apologise, they added: ""I'll leave that to the Foreign Office."" The BBC has approached Lammy for comment."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqj3z4g0e1o","Do we need cocoa-free chocolate and is it nice?",2025-04-10,"Chris Baraniuk","Technology Reporter","The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There's no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles. And as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don't get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn't chocolate. It's made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans. The selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring. ""The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,"" says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. ""In January just gone, it's shot up by 14%."" That's the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa – which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans – has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024.  ""I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now – I don't remember a big story like this on costs going up,"" adds Mr Caines. A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa. Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports. It means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year. Real chocolate could become a ""luxury"" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba. The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks. Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however – and not a very happy one. A New Yorker article claims a generation was ""traumatized"" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently. But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob ""really doesn't taste like chocolate"" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa. Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains. There could be health benefits to this. ""We can reduce drastically the sugar content,"" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa. German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices. Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva. ""We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,"" explains Dr Marquart. ""It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market."" ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France – though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva. When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm. I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty. The company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try – the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating. Overall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate. A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture. ""We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,"" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally – to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans. ""There's around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,"" says Mr Newton. It's early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year. Mr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company's product manages to include 24 of them – though in some cases at slightly different concentrations. The company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you'd expect, and very satisfying to chew. ""Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,"" says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat. He adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products – such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: ""The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable."" Should chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University. ""It's something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,"" she says. Cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world. Nukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don't aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls. Dr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees. Poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a study published in February. By shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years."

The firm currently directly owns and operates 151 restaurants, with another 154 operated by franchisees, mainly in the US. The company said its restaurants, which serve classic American bar food, will stay open during the process and operate ""in a business-as-usual manner"". Like many other casual dining chains, Hooters has struggled in recent years as it faces rising costs and wages, as well as customers spending less. ""Our renowned Hooters restaurants are here to stay,"" Sal Melilli, chief executive of Hooters of America, said in a statement. ""Today's announcement marks an important milestone in our efforts to reinforce Hooters' financial foundation."" The firm said it plans to sell all of its corporate-owned restaurants to a group of two existing Hooters franchisees, who operate 14 of Hooters' most popular outlets, around the Tampa, Florida, and Chicago, Illinois, areas. The group includes some of the chain's founders, who have promised to take the firm ""back to its roots"" and make it more family-friendly. Hooters did not reveal the value of the planned deal, which still needs to be approved by a US bankruptcy judge. It said the rescue plan is expected to be completed within the next four months. Hooters was founded in 1983 and is known for its serving staff, who are mainly young women - known as ""Hooters Girls"" - as well as its chicken wings. The form-fitting outfits worn by its waiting staff have become central to the chain's public image."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwydv40g892o","What is live shopping and will it take off?",2025-04-03,"David Silverberg","Technology Reporter","After graduating college Kelsey Krakora worked full time in a steakhouse, bartending and serving meals. She had dabbled with selling clothes online, but only part-time.  But in 2021 that all changed for Cleveland-based Ms Krakora. She switched to selling clothes on Whatnot and then Poshmark - online marketplaces where people can also use live video to sell items. ""My first live show with Poshmark was 27th November 2022. I sold zero things on my first show... but that didn't last long!"" Now she sells around 100 items per show, worth about $1,000 in sales (£773).  Her shows are on average three hours long and she does between two and three a week. ""These events are inclusive, welcoming, you can shop in your PJs, and there's no need to head to the shopping mall,"" says Ms Krakora. Live shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products. Live shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters.  But live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon. Also, as younger generations increasingly cut the cord and can't access cable TV, shopping channels don't hold the same relevance as they once did. It's estimated the live shopping market has reached $32bn, with the most active sectors being fashion, cosmetics and collectibles. A 2024 survey from digital commerce platform VTEX found that 45% of US consumers have browsed or purchased from live shopping events in the past 12 months.   Guillaume Faure, chief executive of LiveMeUp, which provides live shopping video software, remembers when interest in live shopping surged. ""When Instagram introduced Reels, and when YouTube launched Shorts, we saw live shopping really take off.""  He's noticed the popularity of tutorials and how-to videos in live shopping events, such as how hosts can teach shoppers how to apply a certain type of make-up, or arrange a variety of flowers to deliver the most evocative bouquet. However, some analysts think that live shopping is likely to have a limited appeal. ""Many companies have tried live shopping but it simply doesn't scale,"" says Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research. ""Maybe it works in China where they don't have the same kind of store density we have in the US, where it's better for consumers to go and try something on rather than watch a host try on a piece of clothing,"" she adds.  Jonathan Reynolds,  academic director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, University of Oxford, also highlights that the Chinese market is different. ""In China, so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs) like Li Jiaqi, the so-called 'Lipstick King, are well established,"" he says. ""Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,"" Mr Reynolds explains. Even Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream. For example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. ""I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,"" she says, ""and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like."" Bruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive.  ""Consumers may get addicted to the show or channel... and some consumers may not be able to stop watching and spending as they get caught up in the moment,"" he adds. Despite those potential pitfalls, major brands and platforms have jumped on the live shopping bandwagon. Nordstrom, Kit Kat, Samsung and L'Oreal have sold products during these streams as hosts showcased new or discounted products, and joining Poshmark as the host for these events are Amazon, eBay, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. ""Live shopping lets shoppers have a conversation with someone who knows the products being sold, and that generates a lot of excitement,"" says Manish Chandra, the chief executive and founder of Poshmark. ""It also creates a community where other shoppers are in the same show, and it's really a different experience than a traditional shopping trip."" For some brands live shopping has been a game-changer. High-end fragrance brand The House of Amouage partnered with Nordstrom in late 2024 to bring their live shopping events to the US. Oman-based Amouage was following up on the success they enjoyed in China. In the 140 live streams they hosted with Chinese influencers on the social platforms Douyin and Taobao in 2023, they sold more than 3,000 units. The firm's chief creative officer Renaud Salmon says it's helping the company learn about what its customers want.  ""In the past, we would have used customer satisfaction surveys,"" says Mr Salmon, ""but with live shopping, we get feedback right away and I bring that back to my team to help refine our products."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3qlz2y3gyo","How might tariffs change the price of Nike's iconic trainers?",2025-04-05,"Annabelle Liang","Business reporter","The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan. But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia – a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of ""ripping off"" Americans. Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain. Follow live updates So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer? It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for. Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%. Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a ""very productive"" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls. But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up. Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes. Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production. ""Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,"" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note. David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.  ""This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,"" he says. Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament. Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.  It had around $51bn (£39.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%. But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense. By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%. That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items. Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low. Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer. ""So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),"" he says. Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years. Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as ""still far from the final conclusion"". ""I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,"" he says. Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: ""Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?"" Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.  Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence. And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America. Sentiment in the US is a ""significant concern"" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.  But ultimately he says firms may be forced to pass the cost of the levies on to consumers. ""Nike is very likely to raise prices if the tariff war persists. There is no way for brands to absorb a 30% to 50% increase in sourcing costs."" He adds: ""How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact."" China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own. Part of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US. However, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon ""due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing"". That includes the time needed to ""consider a long list of factors when deciding where to source their products - quality, costs, speed to market and various social and environmental compliance risks"". Matt Powers from the Powers Advisory Group says the lack of American textile mills will make it ""difficult and expensive [for Nike] to pivot production back to the US"". Mr Powers added: ""This transition, if pursued, would take years and require significant investment."" Nike did not respond to BBC requests for comment for this article. We also contacted 30 suppliers in Asia but none responded. Additional reporting by Natalie Sherman in New York"
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c05nm241ddpo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kascie Weir scored her first international goal as Northern Ireland picked up a much-needed 1-0 win against Romania in the Nations League at Windsor Park. The 18-year-old Glentoran striker scored what proved to be the winner when she converted Keri Halliday's cross on eight minutes. After a frustrating 1-1 draw in Bucharest on Friday night, this was a much sharper display from Tanya Oxtoby's side, who remain second in Group B1 after a second win in four games. They will finish their campaign with a home game against Poland on 30 May and trip to Bosnia-Herzegovina on 3 June. Oxtoby made four changes to the side that started on Friday as Nadene Caldwell, Caragh Hamilton, Halliday and Weir were all handed starts. Despite the hosts dominating possession early on, Romania went close to scoring on five minutes. Maria Ficzay's free-kick deflected off Halliday and fell kindly into the path of Ana Maria Stanciu, who was unable to direct her header on target. Northern Ireland then went ahead after a well-worked move involving two of the young players brought into the starting team. Brenna McPartlan released Halliday down the right and she squared the ball for Weir to sweep home from six yards. Oxtoby's side continued to look dangerous every time they went forward but, like on Friday, they lacked the cutting edge in the final third to add to their advantage. Their sloppiness in possession allowed Romania back into the game and they nearly equalised three minutes before half-time. Ficzay floated in a free-kick which Jackie Burns could only punch out to Florentina Olar-Spanu and her fierce strike was cleared off the line by Ellie Mason. Burns then turned Olar-Spanu's looping effort over the crossbar after Stefania Vatafu found Romania's captain unmarked on the edge of the box, as NI were forced to dig deep to hold on to their lead heading into the break. Northern Ireland made a fast start to the second half with Mason forcing Andreea Paraluta to palm her powerful effort over the crossbar two minutes after the restart. They almost gifted Romania a goal before the hour as Hamilton, captain on her 50th appearance, gave the ball to Cristina Carp when trying to find Caldwell, but the Romania striker fired straight at Burns. After a lull in the game, Danielle Maxwell, who scored on Friday, had an immediate impact coming off the bench as she saw a shot blocked after a neat exchange with Simone Magill. Fellow substitute Connie Scofield squandered a chance to double their lead on 81 minutes as her first-time effort was beaten away by Paraluta after the ball fell to her in the box. The home side were indebted to Burns for preserving their lead in injury time as she thwarted Mihaela Ciolacu's volley from inside the box. They managed to see out the victory despite the late Romanian pressure as they moved on to seven points in the standings. Oxtoby's side will now have to battle it out with the Bosnia-Herzegovina for second place, after the Bosnians held group leaders Poland to a 1-1 draw on Tuesday to move within three points of Northern Ireland."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nplgm2kpo","A revolution is under way in India's trainer industry",2025-04-08,"Priti Gupta","Technology Reporter","It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products. Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year. So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.  Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers. The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: ""The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,"" he explains.  ""There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,"" Mr Panaruna added. The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports. To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.  Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility. ""These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,"" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.  But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.  Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.  Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.  Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.  ""Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,"" he says. ""Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them."" So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok? ""It's complicated,"" says Mr Sharma.  ""I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide. ""What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold."" Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands.  While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused. Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class. Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement. Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.  ""There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven. ""And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult."" Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate. It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing. ""This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,"" says founder Utkarsh Gupta. He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads. ""Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,"" he says. Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. ""The shift to high value is now happening."" ""Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,"" he adds.  Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry. ""The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry."" But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable. ""The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly. ""But I don't think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r8n3yx1x5o","Global executions at highest level since 2015, report says",2025-04-08,"Emma Rossiter","BBC News","The number of state executions around the world has reached its highest level in ten years, a new report by Amnesty International has said. More than 1,500 recorded executions took place in 2024 with Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia accounting for a combined 1,380 and the United States for 25, the charity found. Despite this rise, the report also found that the total number of countries carrying out the death penalty stood at 15 - the lowest number on record for the second consecutive year. Amnesty International's Secretary General Agnes Callamard said the ""tide is turning"" on capital punishment, adding that ""it is only a matter of time until the world is free from the shadow of the gallows"". While these figures are the highest they have been since 2015 - when at least 1,634 people were subject to the death penalty - the true overall figure is likely to be higher. Amnesty International says the figure does not include those killed in China, which it believes carries out thousands of executions each year. North Korea and Vietnam are also not included. Data on the use of the death penalty is classified as a state secret both in China and Vietnam, meaning that the charity has been unable to access statistics. Other obstacles, such as restrictive state practices or the ongoing crises in Gaza and Syria, meant that little or no information was available for those areas. The report, entitled Death Sentences and Executions 2024, cited that Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia were responsible for the overall rise in known executions. Iraq almost quadrupled its executions from at least 16 to at least 63, while Saudi Arabia doubled its yearly total from 172 to at least 345. Executions in Iran rose from at least 853 in 2023 to at least 972 in 2024. The report also said that the two main reasons for the spike in the use of capital punishment was down to ""countries weaponising the death penalty against protesters"" and for ""drug-related crimes"". The charity found that more than 40% of executions in 2024 were carried out for drug-related offences, which it said was unlawful under human rights law. In 2024, Zimbabwe signed into law a bill that abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes and, since September 2024, the world has seen two cases where death row inmates in Japan and the US have been acquitted and granted clemency respectively. The charity also said more than two thirds of all UN member states voted in favour of a moratorium on the use of the death penalty last year."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm257z1y2q9o","Trump to charge high tariffs on 'worst offenders' globally",2025-04-03,"Natalie Sherman","BBC News, New York","President Donald Trump has announced new import taxes on all goods entering the US, in the biggest upheaval of the international trade order since the aftermath of World War Two. His plan sets a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports, consistent with his proposal during last year's White House campaign. Items from about 60 trade partners that the White House described as the ""worst offenders"", including the European Union and China, face higher rates - payback for unfair trade policies, Trump said. Analysts said the trade war escalation was likely to lead to higher prices for Americans and slower growth in the US, while some countries around the world could be plunged into recession. But in Wednesday's announcement at the White House, Trump said the measures were necessary because countries were taking advantage of the US by imposing high tariffs and other trade barriers.  Declaring a national emergency, the Republican president said the US had for more than five decades been ""looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike"". ""It's our declaration of economic independence,"" Trump said in the Rose Garden against a backdrop of US flags. The White House said the US would start charging the 10% tariffs on 5 April, with the higher duties for certain nations starting on 9 April.   ""Today we are standing up for the American worker and we are finally putting America first,"" Trump said, calling it ""one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history"". His decision stunned many analysts.  ""He just dropped a nuclear bomb on the global trading system,"" Ken Rogoff, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, told the BBC.  Tariffs are taxes on imports. On the campaign trail last year, Trump said he would use them to boost manufacturing, promising a new age of US prosperity. He spent weeks previewing Wednesday's announcement, which followed other orders raising tariffs on imports from China, foreign cars, steel and aluminium and 25% on some goods from Mexico and Canada.  For now, the White House said the latest changes would not change anything for Mexico and Canada, two of America's closest trading partners, due to those existing measures. The White House said items, such as steel, copper and pharmaceuticals, which are already facing separate tariffs, threatened or announced, were also not affected by Wednesday's action. But other allies will face new tariffs, including 10% for the UK and 20% for the European Union, said Trump. The measure introduces a new 34% tariff on goods from China, on top of an existing 20% levy, bringing total duties to at least 54%. The tariff rate will be 24% on goods from Japan, and 26% from India. Some of the highest duties will hit exports from countries that have seen a rush of investment in recent years, as firms shifted supply chains away from China following tariffs in Trump's first term.  Goods from Vietnam and Cambodia will be hit with 46% and 49% respectively.  Higher levies will also fall on much smaller nations, with products from the southern African country of Lesotho facing 50%.  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned other countries not to hit back.  ""My advice to every country right now is, do not retaliate,"" Bessent told Fox News. ""Sit back, take it in, let's see how it goes. Because if you retaliate, there will be escalation,"" he said. ""If you don't retaliate, this is the high watermark."" Later however, China's commerce ministry said it ""firmly"" opposed the US's new tariffs and will take ""resolute countermeasures to safeguard its rights and interests"". European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen also said she was preparing to take further steps against the US in the event that negotiations failed. The new duties will affect trillions of dollars in trade, likely setting the stage for higher prices in the US on clothing, European wine, bicycles, toys and thousands of other items. Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at the Fitch Ratings agency, said the measures would bring the US tariff rate to what was in place in 1910. ""Many countries will likely end up in a recession,"" he said.  The US stock market was closed for trading by the time that Trump made his announcement, which he billed as ""Liberation Day"". But shares in the Asia-Pacific region opened lower on Thursday morning. Japan's benchmark stock index, the Nikkei 225, was down by 4% in early trading. Australia's ASX 200 was around 2% lower. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described the tariffs as ""worse than the worst case"" that investors had anticipated.  But he said he believed there would be negotiations and exemptions. Trump has described his measures as ""reciprocal"" - intending them as a retaliation for other countries' policies that he says fuel high trade imbalances. These include high tariffs, as well as Value Added Tax (VAT) or regulations that bar foods with traces of certain chemicals.  Trump also reinstated plans to end tax-free treatment for small packages from China as of May, a move that would hurt Amazon rivals such as Shein and Temu. He confirmed that a 25% tax on imports of all foreign-made cars, which he announced last week, would begin from midnight. "
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewvpkw7weo","The plans to put data centres in orbit and on the Moon",2025-04-09,"Emma Woollacott","Technology reporter","It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon. ""The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,"" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings. Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX. Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments. Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them. And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off. Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth. The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world. As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey. New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling. And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby. Putting data centres in space – either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts. Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground. Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results. The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results. It determined that deploying data centres in space ""could transform the European digital landscape"", and be ""more eco-friendly"". Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers. Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit. Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible. ""But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,"" he says. ""The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037."" However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition. ""Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,"" he says. ""Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars. ""Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity."" Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity. Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk. Dr Vicinanza adds: ""And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely. ""A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months."" Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. ""We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,"" says Mr Scott. Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026. Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station. ""It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,"" he says. ""You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access."" The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups. And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin. ""Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,"" he says. Lonestar already has customers lined up, including the state of Florida and the Isle of Man government."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qndqz41jxo","Tariffs 'hard to come back from', says US pharma boss",2025-04-03,"Simon Jack","Business editor","The boss of US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly has told the BBC there is no looking back from Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from the rest of the world.  In an exclusive interview, David Ricks described it as a watershed moment in US economic history, ""I think it's a pivot in US policy and it feels like it'll be hard to come back from here."" While Mr Ricks said he thought it may encourage some companies to relocate some manufacturing, he was doubtful it would also create hundreds of billions in additional revenue for the US promised by President Trump. He also added that the UK's status as a pharmaceutical and life sciences power was in decline. Eli Lilly is a pharmaceutical giant based in Indianapolis worth $750bn (£573bn; €676bn) with 50,000 employees across the US, Europe and Asia. Due to their complex supply chains and the often life-saving products they make, pharmaceutical companies along with microchip makers were temporarily exempted from the tariffs imposed on all products imported into the US. But Mr Ricks seemed in little doubt that tariffs will eventually hit and that this will  have damaging consequences for investment in new medicines. He explained drug prices were essentially capped in Europe and the US, which meant the impact of tariffs would be felt elsewhere. ""We can't breach those agreements so we have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade offs within our own companies,"" he said. ""Typically that will be in reduction of staff or research and development (R&D) and I predict R&D will come first. That's a disappointing outcome."" Mr Ricks said he did not support the imposition of tariffs but understood its intention and respected President Trump's political mandate. ""We don't support tariffs, to be clear. In pharma, about 70% of global R&D takes place in the United States. So we're creating the next generation of breakthroughs and cures. ""But the production is heavily weighted outside the US. And that's not unique to our industry. It happened with electronics and software and other things"". ""So I think what this administration is saying is we want both. We want the means of production and we want the research and development intellectual property generation."" Eli Lilly are in the process of building a new additional $800m facility in Ireland, where they employ more than 3,000 people. Mr Ricks said that development would proceed. ""There's plenty of demand outside the US so we'd have to look at the flow of goods because we wouldn't want to have to pay tariffs if we didn't need to, but I think for the moment that's fine."" But Mr Ricks said that its investment in the UK had been in decline and warned that slow regulation and poor uptake of new medicines threatened the UK's reputation as an important life sciences hub and that patients were missing out on new advances in medicine. Mr Ricks said he delivered some ""candid"" comments to senior ministers including the prime minister, health secretary and business secretary. ""The UK's advantage is slipping. If you look at the numbers there is disinvestment in research and development. It's been on a steady decline,"" he said. So is the UK complacent when it thinks of itself as a life sciences super power? ""That's one way to put it."" Mr Ricks said countries like Germany spend nearly double of their health budget on medicines. ""The UK is not a large market. But what it could be is an exceptional market. ""You need three things to make our industry work. A strong intellectual property system, and the UK is quite good. ""You need a regulator that's timely, efficient and predictable - pretty good there as well. ""But most importantly you need a commercial market that rewards innovation - and here there's been significant backsliding""."

A veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, he is one of a growing number of people in Canada, Europe, and other parts of the world, who are avoiding buying US products due to President Trump's tariffs and treatment of US allies. ""I have in my life served alongside American forces. It is just profoundly upsetting and disappointing to see where we are given the historical ties that our two countries have,"" says Mr Brayman, who lives in Nova Scotia. ""But I think right now it's time to stand up and be counted, and in my mind, that means buying local and supporting Canadian business."" Together with his wife, Mr Brayman has replaced all the American products he used to buy, including his previous wine of choice, with Canadian alternatives. ""Luckett Phone Box Red wine, which is from right here in Nova Scotia, is great,"" he says. Determining which products are Canadian isn't always easy however. ""Sometimes labelling can be misleading,"" adds Mr Brayman. To help, he now uses an app on his phone that can scan a product's barcode and identify where it's from. If the product is identified as American, the app suggests Canadian alternatives. The app, called Maple Scan, is one of numerous emerging in Canada to help people shop local. Others include Buy Canadian, Is This Canadian? and Shop Canadian. Maple Scan's founder, Sasha Ivanov, says his app has had 100,000 downloads since it launched last month. He believes the momentum around buying Canadian is here to stay. ""Lots of Canadians have told me, 'I'm not going back'. It's important that we support local regardless,"" he says. Canadians like Mr Brayman are boycotting American products in response to a raft of import tariffs introduced by Trump. These included tariffs of 25% on all foreign cars, steel and aluminium, and 25% tariffs on other Canadian and Mexican goods. Meanwhile, other European Union exports will get tariffs of 20%, while the UK is facing 10%. Trump says the tariffs will boost US manufacturing, raise tax revenue and reduce the US trade deficit. However, they have spooked global markets, which have fallen sharply over the past month. Trump has even expressed a desire for Canada to join the US as its 51st state, something the Canadian government was quick to strongly reject. Ottawa has also responded with C$60bn ($42bn; £32bn) in counter tariffs, as well as additional tariffs on the US auto sector. And there has been a substantial drop in the number of Canadians travelling to the US. Groups dedicated to boycotting US goods have also emerged in European countries. Momentum behind the boycott is particularly strong in Denmark, whose territory of Greenland Trump has said he wants to acquire. Denmark's largest grocery store operator, Salling Group, recently introduced a symbol, a black star, on pricing labels to denote European brands. Bo Albertus, a school principal who lives in Skovlunde, a suburb of Copenhagen, says joining the boycott was his way of taking action. ""Statements that Trump made about wanting to buy Greenland, that was just too much for me,"" he says. ""I can't do anything about the American political system, but I can vote with my credit card."" One of Mr Albertus's first moves was to cancel his subscriptions to US streaming services, including Netflix, Disney Plus and Apple TV. ""My 11-year-old daughter is a bit annoyed about it, but that's the way it is. She understands why I do it,"" he says. Mr Albertus is the administrator for a Danish Facebook group dedicated to helping people boycott US goods. In the group, which has 90,000 members, people share recommendations for local alternatives to US goods, from shoes to lawnmowers. Mr Albertus says: ""It's a movement that is quite a lot bigger than just our little country, so it all that adds up."" Mette Heerulff Christiansen, the owner of a grocery shop in Copenhagen called Broders has stopped stocking American products, such as Cheetos crisps and Hershey's chocolate, in her store. She is substituting them with Danish or European products where possible. Ms Christiansen is also swapping out products she uses at home. She's finding some easier to replace than others. ""Coca-Cola is easy to substitute with Jolly Cola, a Danish brand,"" she says. ""But technology, like Facebook, that's totally difficult to avoid."" She believes the boycott movement in Denmark is helping people to channel their anger at Trump's policies and rhetoric. ""I think it's more for the Danish people to feel good that they are doing something,"" she says. Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, who specializes in the history of US trade policy, believes the economic impact of the boycott may be limited. ""It is hard to judge how economically significant the consumer boycotts will be in terms of reducing trade with the United States,"" he says. ""In the past, boycotts have not lasted long and have not achieved much. It starts as a hostile reaction to some US action but tends to fade with time,"" he says. For now though, the rising Buy Canadian sentiment in Canada is boosting sales for many local brands. The CEO of Canadian grocer Loblaw posted on LinkedIn that weekly sales of Canadian products were up by double digits. Bianca Parsons, from Alberta in Canada, is behind an initiative to promote locally-made goods, called Made In Alberta, which she says has had a surge in interest since the tariffs were introduced. ""We're now getting over 20,000 hits [to the site] every two weeks."" Ms Parsons, who is the executive director of the Alberta Food Processors Association, adds: ""I've had producers reach out to us and say: 'I'm selling out at stores that I would never sell out before, thank you so much'."" Several Canadian provinces, including Ontario and Nova Scotia, have removed US-made alcoholic beverages from their liquor store shelves in response to tariffs, a move the boss of Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman has said is ""worse than tariffs"". Among the American businesses feeling the impact is Caledonia Spirits, a distiller based in Vermont, near the Canadian border.  Ryan Christiansen, Caledonia's president and head distiller, says his business had an order on track for shipment to Quebec cancelled directly after tariffs were announced. ""My sense is that everyone's just being a little too aggressive and, unfortunately, I think America started that,"" says Mr Christiansen. ""I do understand that the action America took needed a counter reaction. ""If it were up to me, I'd be at the table trying to resolve this in a friendly way, and I'm hopeful that the leaders in America take that approach."" Ethan Frisch, the co-founder of Burlap & Barrel, an American spice company based in New York, which also exports to Canada, says he's more concerned with the impact of the tariffs on his company's imports and rising inflation in the US than the consumer boycott. He says: ""I think there's this assumption that, if you boycott an American company, it's going to have an impact on the economy and maybe change the situation. I think that assumption, unfortunately, is not accurate. ""The [US] economy is crashing all up by itself. Businesses like ours are struggling without boycotts."""

Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region fell for a second day, hot on the heels of the US S&P 500, which had its worst day since Covid crashed the economy in 2020.  Nike, Apple and Target were among big consumer names worst hit, all of them sinking by more than 9%.  At the White House, Trump told reporters the US economy would ""boom"" thanks to the minimum 10% tariff he plans to slap on global imports in the hope of boosting federal revenues and bringing American manufacturing home. The Republican president plans to hit products from dozens of other countries with far higher levies, including trade partners such as China and the European Union. China, which is facing an aggregate 54% tariff, and the EU, which faces duties of 20%, both vowed retaliation on Thursday.  French President Emmanuel Macron called for European firms to suspend planned investment in the US. Tariffs are taxes on goods imported from other countries, and Trump's plan that he announced on Wednesday would hike such duties to some of the highest levels in more than 100 years. The World Trade Organization said it was ""deeply concerned"", estimating trade volumes could shrink as a result by 1% this year. Traders expressed concern that the tariffs could stoke inflation and stall growth.  In morning trading on Friday, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell by 2.7% and Australia's ASX 200 was down by 1.6%. The Kospi in South Korea was flat to slightly lower. Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong are closed for the Qingming Festival. On Thursday, the S&P 500 - which tracks 500 of the biggest American firms - plunged 4.8%, shedding roughly $2tn in value.  The Dow Jones closed about 4% lower, while the Nasdaq tumbled roughly 6%. The US shares sell-off has been going on since mid-February amid trade war fears.  Earlier, the UK's FTSE 100 share index dropped 1.5% and other European markets also fell, echoing declines from Japan to Hong Kong. On Thursday at the White House, Trump doubled down on a high-stakes gambit aimed at reversing decades of US-led liberalisation that shaped the global trade order. ""I think it's going very well,"" he said. ""It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on, and it's a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is."" He added: ""The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom."" Contradicting White House aides who insisted the new tariffs were not a negotiating tactic, Trump signalled he might be open to a deal with trade partners ""if somebody said we're going to give you something that's so phenomenal"". On Thursday, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said that country would retaliate with a 25% levy on vehicles imported from the US. Trump last month imposed tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico, though he did not announce any new duties on Wednesday against the North American trade partners. Firms now face a choice of swallowing the tariff cost, working with partners to share that burden, or passing it on to consumers - and risking a drop in sales.  That could have a major impact as US consumer spending amounts to about 10% - 15% of the world economy, according to some estimates. While stocks fell on Thursday, the price of gold, which is seen as a safer asset in times of turbulence, touched a record high of $3,167.57 an ounce at one point on Thursday, before falling back. The dollar also weakened against many other currencies.  In Europe, the tariffs could drag down growth by nearly a percentage point, with a further hit if the bloc retaliates, according to analysts at Principal Asset Management.  In the US, a recession is likely to materialise without other changes, such as big tax cuts, which Trump has also promised, warned Seema Shah, chief global strategist at the firm. She said Trump's goals of boosting manufacturing would be a years-long process ""if it happens at all"". ""In the meantime, the steep tariffs on imports are likely to be an immediate drag on the economy, with limited short-term benefit,"" she said. On Thursday, Stellantis, which makes Jeep, Fiat and other brands, said it was temporarily halting production at a factory in Toluca, Mexico and Windsor, Canada.  It said the move, a response to Trump's 25% tax on car imports, would also lead to temporary layoffs of 900 people at five plants in the US that supply those factories.  On the stock market, Nike, which makes much of its sportswear in Asia, was among the hardest hit on the S&P, with shares down 14%. Shares in Apple, which relies heavily on China and Taiwan, tumbled 9%. Other retailers also fell, with Target down roughly 10%. Motorbike maker Harley-Davidson – which was the subject of retaliatory tariffs by the EU during Trump's first term as president – fell 10%. In Europe, shares in sportswear firm Adidas fell more than 10%, while stocks in rival Puma tumbled more than 9%. Among luxury goods firms, jewellery maker Pandora fell more than 10%, and LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) dropped more than 3% after tariffs were imposed on the European Union and Switzerland. ""You're seeing retailers get destroyed right now because tariffs extended to countries we did not expect,"" said Jay Woods, chief global strategy at Freedom Capital Markets, adding that he expected more turbulence ahead.

The 61 year old died in October 2021 when his motorcycle was involved in a collision with a car in the Whitepark Road area of Ballycastle, County Antrim. Anne Broughton, 71, from the Whitepark Road in Ballycastle, confirmed she understood the single charge of causing death by careless driving against her at Coleraine Magistrates' Court on Thursday. She said she had no objections to the case being returned for trial at the Crown Court. Mr Tweed was a councillor for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) but left the party in 2007 over its decision to share power with Sinn Féin. He later joined the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV). In 2012, he was convicted on child sex abuse charges, which were quashed in 2016 due to the way the jury was directed in his initial trial, after he served four years of an eight-year sentence. His family have spoken out about the abuse. Following his conviction, he was expelled from the Orange Order and was suspended and then replaced by the TUV.

The firm says it has now resolved the IT problems caused by increased traffic on its website at the start of the week. But users have reported ongoing difficulties as they scrambled to protect their genetic information, health histories, and ancestry details. A number of those who have successfully removed their data have also told the BBC of their ongoing anxieties about 23andMe's future. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday in order to sell itself through a court-supervised process. ""If 23andMe is going to be sold, then my data can be sold, from what I hear,"" said 52 year old Danielle Landriscina of Maryland. Ms Landriscina signed up for 23andMe in 2018 to connect with members of her father's side of the family. ""What's stopping something like a health insurance company from buying my data and then using it to determine if I get health insurance or how much I have to pay for it?,"" added Ms Landriscina, who works in tech sales. For now, 23andMe ""will not voluntarily share your Personal Information"" with insurance companies, the company's current privacy statement says.  But the future is less certain. 23andMe's proposed May 14 auction of its assets could include the genetic data of its millions of customers. To protect herself, Ms Landriscina said she tried multiple times to log into her 23andMe account starting on Tuesday morning, both on her phone and through a web browser. She was among the many customers asked to complete the login process by email using two-factor authentication to verify her identity. She said she didn't receive a verification code until the evening, and only saw it after a ten-minute window to use the code had expired.  Earlier in the day, the company's online chat service advised her to try again later due to a surge in traffic to the website. It wasn't until Tuesday night that she was able to remove her account from the company's database.  ""If anyone has any issues in regards to accessing their account or deleting their data, they can go to our customer care site for support,"" a 23andMe spokesperson said in reply to a BBC inquiry. The company did not reply to subsequent emails detailing the customer complaints the BBC learned about. Pauline Long of Alabama also said she made multiple attempts to access her account starting early on Tuesday morning. ""This has been a nightmare and I am now going to be more cautious about doing anything online,"" Ms Long told the BBC in an email. She said she waited for two hours to chat with a customer service agent. She was finally able to delete her account by Tuesday evening but expressed scepticism about whether the company had actually deleted her information. ""I am concerned that 23andMe will hold onto data,"" Ms Long said. According to 23andMe, deleting an account and associated data will permanently delete the data associated with all profiles within the account. Attorneys General from multiple US states - including California, Arizona, South Carolina, and New York - have advised 23andMe customers to purge their information from the firm's database given the sensitivity of the material it has amassed during its years in operation. ""Every individual will have a different appetite for risk and will value their own private information differently,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta told the BBC by phone Monday.  ""It's up to them what they do, but I wanted to advise them of their right to delete."" On Friday, Mr Bonta issued a consumer alert offering users a step-by-step guide on what to do as signs of 23andMe's financial distress mounted.  ""It's exactly a moment like this when a reminder of the rights and protections you have is appropriate, so you can determine if and how you want to exercise those rights,"" Mr Bonta said. According to 23andMe, any buyer of the company will have to abide by laws that apply to how customer's data is treated, and any transaction will be subject to customary regulatory approvals. Customers who previously asked 23andMe to store a DNA sample can ask that it be destroyed. For users who opted into 23andMe's research programme, personal information will no longer be used in future research projects, the company said. 23andMe's said it would continue to protect customer data as laid out in its privacy policy.  But it acknowledged that if it was ""involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your Personal Information may be accessed, sold or transferred as part of that transaction."" It says its privacy statement will apply to personal information when transferred to the new entity. ""A new company would have to continue to manage customer data under the privacy policy,"" said Anya Prince, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law. But, Prince notes, the company also says it ""may make changes"" to its privacy statement ""from time to time,"" leaving the door open to a new company altering how it manages customer data. 62-year old genealogist Michele Lewis of Georgia said she found the process of deleting her data more straightforward than another attempt she made a few months ago when she was subjected to a waiting period. ""It was much easier and it was deleted almost immediately,"" Ms Lewis told the BBC in an email Tuesday. ""I have never really been too worried about privacy issues or hacking or anything, but this isn't the first time 23andMe has had issues."" In 2023, millions of 23andMe customer accounts were compromised in a massive data breach. The company reached a $30 million settlement stemming from the breach in September. Ms Lewis, who used a 23andMe test kit in 2008, said it wasn't hard to part with the company. ""I very rarely access 23andMe anymore anyways,"" she said. Some customers have said the experience offers a lesson. ""If I had to do it all over again, I would not have done this,"" said Ms Landriscina. ""The benefit does not outweigh what I think now is the harm of having my DNA out there having it possibly sold. It's very concerning."""

John Tavener's The Veil of the Temple will be performed by Edinburgh Festival Chorus, Monteverdi Choir and the National Youth Choir of Scotland. Other highlights include opera incorporating circus performers for a fusion of music and acrobatics in Orpheus And Eurydice, and Breaking Bach - where hip-hop meets 18th-century period instruments. Succession star Brian Cox also returns to the Scottish stage for the first time in a decade in Make It Happen - a satirical play exploring Scotland's role in the global financial crash of 2008. Cox will play pioneering Scottish economist and philosopher Adam Smith in the work by playwright James Graham. The programme this year is tied to the theme of ""truth"". It will see more than 1,700 artists from 42 nations, including 600 from Scotland, take to the stage in Edinburgh from 1 - 24 August. Scottish Ballet's Mary, Queen of Scots is a major new production from choreographer Sophie Laplane and co-creator James Bonas that draws on the complex relationship between Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I of England. A choral workshop with amateur singers is also set for the festival's closing concert, Mendelssohn's Elijah. Festival director Nicola Benedetti said the arts were in a position where they could separate fact from disinformation. She said: ""The arts are at an advantage with a problem like that, because what we're trying to get across is that talking about truth versus when you're talking about fact."" Violinist Benedetti, who was made an MBE in 2013 for her services to music and charity, said the opening show was one to watch. She said: ""It's a concert that's going to be an eight-hour performance with 250 singers featuring our festival chorus, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year. ""There'll be an incredible exploration into the essence of truth from perspectives around the world, looking at how all religions actually speak a common, universal truth, so it's breaking down some of that disharmony."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8je0xewlgo","Spain tackles housing 'social emergency' as rents double in a decade",2025-04-04,"Guy Hedgecoe","Business reporter","Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment. Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room. Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts. ""The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,"" says Blanca. ""Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent."" Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article. The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years. ""For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,"" says Blanca. ""It's not viable."" She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs. While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry. It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities. A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation. ""The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,"" says Juan Villén, of Idealista. ""Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast."" Mr Villén offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds. ""We need to build more properties,"" says Mr Villén. ""And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market."" The central government has described the situation as ""a social emergency"" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand. This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe. In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024. The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past. But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control. At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards ""want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like"". The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint. Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028. The Sánchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called ""high-tension"" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate. The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in ""high-tension"" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%. However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market. ""On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,"" says Mr Villén. ""Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market."" Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers. The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently. Gonzalo Álvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer. ""There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,"" he says. ""So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked."" His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent. ""The [central and local] governments are not setting any limits,"" says Mr Álvarez. ""So who is going to? We will have to do it."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7871277kjgo","Trump-endorsed news channel sees shares surge 2,200%",2025-04-02,"Annabelle Liang","Business reporter","Conservative TV company Newsmax has seen its stock market valuation surge by more than 2,200% since its debut in New York on Monday. The US firm's shares, which were originally priced at $10 (£7.75) each, stood at $233 at the end of Tuesday's trading session. That means it has a market value of almost $30bn, which surpasses Fox Corp - the owner of rival Fox News - and other media giants Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount Global. Newsmax is seen as friendly to US President Donald Trump and was promoted by him during his first term in the White House. The share price surge has made Newsmax's founder and chief executive Christopher Ruddy one of the richest people in the US, with a net worth of more than $9bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Analysts said retail investors drove gains, drawing comparisons to the soaring price of GameStop. The video game retailer's popularity among some investors during the pandemic helped coin the idea of meme stocks. The meme-stock phenomenon was part of a wider increase in trading by retail investors - people not working for investment houses or other private firms. Newsmax was founded in 1998 as an online platform. It launched its cable news channel in 2014. Its ratings were boosted in 2020 when it was endorsed by Trump, who had become increasingly angry at Fox News. Mr Ruddy, who is a friend of Trump, insisted at the time that he did not want Newsmax to become ""Trump TV"". Earlier this month, Newsmax paid $40m to settle allegations that it defamed voting machine company Smartmatic by reporting false claims that it helped rig the 2020 election for Joe Biden. It is the latest company with ties to conservatives to start selling shares on the stock market, joining Canada-based video platform Rumble Inc and President Trump's media venture, Trump Media & Technology Group."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg5wkk1g1go","Fragmented policing on small boats was exploited, says PM",2025-03-31,"Mark Easton","Home editor","People smugglers have exploited ""fragmented"" policing, border force and intelligence agencies to smuggle thousands of illegal migrants into the UK, the prime minister has said. Sir Keir Starmer said poor organisation had meant the UK was ""a soft touch"" on illegal migration, which smugglers took as an ""open invitation"". The prime minister made the case for tackling illegal migration like terrorism as he spoke at the first ever Organised Immigration Crime Summit in London -  attended by more than 40 countries alongside tech giants like Meta, X and TikTok. The Conservatives said the conference ""will make no difference"" and only Rwanda-style deportations would stop illegal migration. Sir Keir is keen for the UK to be seen as leading the global response to illegal migration - a key issue for the government politically, with both the Conservatives and Reform UK accusing Labour of failing to get a grip on the issue. Since winning the election in 2024, Sir Keir has pushed for treating illegal migration like terrorism, with increased cooperation across countries and enhanced police powers. The government has announced a series of agreements with other countries in an effort to tackle the number of illegal migrants entering the UK. But more than 6,000 people have crossed the Channel so far in 2025, making it a record start to a year for small boat arrivals. Sir Keir said joint cross-border criminal investigations involving UK authorities were ""beginning to bear fruit"". Since July, the government said more than 24,000 individuals with no right to be in the UK had been deported. Launching a two-day summit at Lancaster House, the prime minister said he was ""angry"" about the scale of illegal migration. ""It makes me angry, frankly, because it's unfair on ordinary working people who pay the price - from the cost of hotels, to our public services struggling under the strain,"" he said. Illegal migration was also ""a massive driver of global insecurity"" which ""undermines our ability to control who comes here"", Sir Keir said. ""And it's unfair on the illegal migrants themselves, because these are vulnerable people being ruthlessly exploited by vile gangs."" Officials from Vietnam, Albania and Iraq - countries from which many migrants have travelled to the UK - attended the summit at London's Lancaster House, alongside French, Chinese and US representatives. Representatives from social media companies Meta, X and TikTok also joined, alongside Kurdish leaders and Interpol to take part in discussions on how to disrupt a criminal trade worth an estimated $10bn (£7.7bn) a year.   Sir Keir told attendees: ""There has never been a bigger gathering of people on this issue, building a truly international effort to defeat organised immigration crime."" Labour campaigned on a promise to scrap the previous government's plan to send some migrants to Rwanda. On Monday, Sir Keir blamed the Conservatives for pursuing the scheme, while smugglers slipped through the cracks in services. ""We inherited this total fragmentation between our policing, our Border Force and our intelligence agencies,"" Sir Keir said. ""A fragmentation that made it crystal clear, when I looked at it, that there were gaps in our defence, an open invitation at our borders for the people smugglers to crack on. ""To be honest, it should have been fixed years ago."" Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Sir Keir's immigration plans ""already lie in tatters"".  He said: ""We are about to see 30,000 illegal channel crossings since the election reached this week, a 31% increase. ""This year so far has been the worst on record."" The spike in channel crossings was ""a direct consequence of the government cancelling the Rwanda deterrent before it even started,"" Philp said. ""Today's conference will make no difference,"" he added. ""Law enforcement alone cannot stop illegal immigration - you need a removals deterrent."" Ahead of the summit, the Home Office announced that £33m would be spent to disrupt people-smuggling networks and boost prosecutions.  Among developments aimed at tackling illegal migration ahead of the gathering: On Sunday, Tory shadow minister Alex Burghart told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that Labour should never have scrapped the Rwanda deportation plan. Earlier, Cooper told the show that plans for new checks on unauthorised working would help cut levels of illegal migration.

It includes multiple cameras, eye-tracking technologies and electronics that work together to simulate scenarios from high stakes military operations. ""Everything has to be perfect,"" says the production specialist. ""So many different things can affect other things that can affect the final product in such a massive, massive way."" Mr Barrientos works for Varjo, one of a growing number of companies in Finland developing innovations that can assist military forces and governments in preparing for or reacting to conflict. The Nordic nation, with a population of just five million, has 368 defence tech companies, according to research for Tesi, a state-funded venture capital company, released last September. Around 40% of these are start-ups and scale-ups, with many growing at rates of 30% to 40% if their tools are dual-use technologies that can also be used in other industries. Helsinki is now among the top five cities in Europe for defence, security and resilience investments, according to a separate report released in February by tech data platform Dealroom, in collaboration with the Nato Innovation Fund, an independent venture capital fund launched in 2023 with funding from 24 Nato allies. Varjo says its headsets are being used to provide 80 simulation programmes to Nato forces in the US and Europe. In simple terms, its products are more advanced versions of the virtual reality headsets used in gaming. But they combine synthetic artificial content with views of real-world environments. This ""mixed reality"" experience ""squeezes the training continuum"" for fighter pilots, says the firm's CEO Timo Toikkanen, because they no longer have to travel long distances to complete war simulations in giant aircraft hangers, which are expensive to power and run. ""You can do 99% of the same [training] inside of the headset."" The start-up had already attracted heavy investment prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and started working with medical research companies and car manufacturers. But Mr Toikkanen says the start of the conflict and Finland's admission to Nato a year later ""just kind of put everything on steroids"" in terms of interest in its defence offering. Since March 2022 the company has raised more than €50m (£42m; $54m) in additional funding.  Mr Toikkanen says that before the war technologies that could be used by military forces used to be ""kind of a red flag"" for investors concerned about social and environmental responsibilities, and Varjo's executives would ""tiptoe around"" that side of the business when seeking funding. Now the opposite is now true. ""Investors are looking for companies that are active in the field of defence technology and it's not frowned upon anymore,"" he explains.  Following President Trump's return to office in January, Mr Toikkanen says there's been a renewed interest in its products from European militaries in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions. ""Suddenly, there's a new understanding that we need to prepare, and we can't only rely on Nato and the United States for our defence."" Listen: Business Daily - Finland's Defence Tech Other rapidly expanding Finnish start-ups in the defence and dual-use sectors include Iceye, which has developed fine-resolution microsatellite-based imaging and data services, and Re-orbit which supplies satellite software. Distance Technologies, a start-up backed by Google creates headset-free immersive technologies. In March it announced a collaboration with Patria, a Finnish legacy defence firm, which will trial the tech on its armoured vehicles. Finland shares around 1,340 km (830 miles) of its border with Russia, and the Finnish government spent a greater proportion of its budget on defence than many other European countries even before the war in Ukraine. ""There's a phrase I like to leverage, which is 'the tyranny of geography' - the closer you are to a threat, the more likely you are to perceive it as more apparent and indeed more existential,"" says Nicholas Nelson, a UK-based defence tech investor and visiting fellow at the University of Oxford. ""They also have a memory of the Winter War, which transpired during World War Two, where they were invaded by the Soviet Union."" The duty of Finns to defend their country is enshrined in the Finnish constitution, and there is mandatory military service for men. Mr Nelson believes this exposure may also have encouraged talented citizens to become founders or investors in defence tech, rather than other fast-growing industries in Europe such as renewable energy or financial technologies. At Maria 01, a former hospital turned startup campus in Helsinki, entrepreneur Janne Hietala opens his laptop to scroll through images of unmanned airships gathering data above snow-covered Arctic forests.  He is the CEO of Kelluu, a company that originally expected its technology to be used by climate researchers, but pivoted to becoming a surveillance platform targeted at cities, governments and research institutions in 2022. ""It was a very concrete, personal feeling that we need to also do something for the security situation,"" says Mr Hietala. He highlights national surveys which suggest at least 80% of the Finnish population are prepared to fight for their country, and agrees with Mr Nelson that this ""spirit to be ready to defend"" has trickled into start-up and business strategies, and is likely to fuel the sector's continued growth. Defence tech companies launching in Finland have also been boosted by a strong general tech scene in the country. Many of the country's tech alumni – including Mr Toikkanen at Varjo – honed their skills at Nokia, the former global mobile phone giant which has its roots in Finland.  It ran into financial difficulties following the launch of Apple's iPhone in the mid-2000s, but this encouraged a sizable number of former employees to launch or invest in new companies. Although not as mature as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Helsinki has spawned a handful of unicorn businesses, worth a billion dollars or more, including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura and game developer Supercell. There is also strong state support for the defence tech scene. Last year Business Finland, a government agency that promotes investment and innovation, launched a new defence and digital resilience programme which is directing €120m towards supporting research and development initiatives from small businesses and startups. ""Our current government… they are really enforcing this kind of public-private collaboration,"" says the programme's director Kirsi Kokko. ""I think they understand the urgency."" Despite the rapid growth of defence tech in Finland, the sector is facing a range of local and European-wide challenges. Mr Hietala, the founder of airship technology platform Kelluu, describes something of a ""culture clash"" between agile start-ups and large defence companies and governments that have typically required years of experimentation and prototyping before acquiring new technologies. ""That's really on the opposite side of the spectrum for start-ups, in which the DNA is that we will fail fast and rapidly, and you don't have every start-up succeed."" At Business Finland, Ms Kokko says the Nordic nation is also impacted by strong global competition for the software talent needed to grow defence tech and dual use businesses. But while Finland's compact size and long dark winters might put off some potential recruitments, she hopes the nation's reputation for innovation, flat working hierarchies and low crime levels can attract employees with the right skill sets - alongside its success in the sector so far. ""We need to have a good story,"" says Kokko. ""And I think we do."""

Shenzhen-based Tencent will own about a quarter of the new business, with Ubisoft holding the rest of the new subsidiary, which is valued at around €4bn. The unit will run some of the French firm's biggest franchises, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. Tencent, which is one of the world's biggest video games developers, is also known for its internet-based services, including the hugely popular messaging app WeChat. ""Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,"" Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft's co-founder and chief executive said in a statement. Tencent, which is China's most valuable company, is now Ubisoft's second biggest shareholder with a stake of just under 10%. ""We are excited to extend our longstanding partnership with Ubisoft through this investment,"" Martin Lau, President of Tencent, said. Ubisoft said it will now focus on its other marquee titles, including Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon and The Division. Ubisoft's stock market value has fallen sharply in recent years after delays to the launches of new games and falling sales.  That's despite its shares getting a boost earlier this month as investors welcomed  the launch of the latest instalment of the Assassin's Creed franchise. The much-anticipated Assassin's Creed Shadows had been delayed several times. It followed the disappointing performance of another of the firm's major titles, Star Wars Outlaws, and concerns from some onlookers about how Ubisoft is being run. ""Ubisoft has all these great games, like Assassin's Creed, that it's known for that recently haven't delivered so much for fans,"" video games journalist Shannon Liao told the BBC. ""There are reasons for why that business is now up for grabs and for Tencent it's an opportunity for them to cash in on these franchises that are so beloved, that have so much street cred for gamers out there."" The Assassin's Creed series has sold more than 200 million copies worldwide and, according to a Ubisoft earnings report published last year, generated about €4bn revenue in the decade up to 2024."

Trump's comments came as he prepares to unveil a massive slate of import taxes on Wednesday, in what he has called America's ""Liberation Day"". These will come on top of Trump's recent import taxes on aluminium, steel and cars, along with increased levies on all goods from China. The tougher stance from Trump has increased nervousness about a trade war hitting the global economy. Trump has offered conflicting signals about the scope of the expected tariffs, which have helped drive steep declines in the US stock market over the last month.   Last week, he had raised the possibility that many countries could receive ""breaks"". But over the weekend, he appeared to be leaning toward a more wide-ranging plan.  ""You'd start with all countries,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. ""Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about."" The UK has said it expects to be affected by US tariffs and is not ruling out retaliating. The prime minister's official spokesman has said talks on an economic deal between the two countries have been ""constructive"", but are likely to last beyond Wednesday. Other jurisdictions, such as the European Union and Canada, have already said that they are preparing a range of retaliatory trade measures. Concerns about the impact of the measures have unsettled markets and reignited fears of a recession in the US. In the US, the S&P 500 share index of the largest firms has fallen almost 10% since mid-February, making March the worst month for the index in years.   The Nasdaq is down more than 10%, its worst quarter since 2022.  With significant uncertainty remaining about the 2 April announcement, shares in the US opened lower but ultimately held their ground on Monday.  The Dow closed up 1%, while the S&P ended up 0.5% and the Nasdaq slipped just 0.1%. Earlier on Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark share index closed more than 4% lower, while the Kospi in South Korea ended down 3%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index fell nearly 0.9%, while Germany's Dax index closed down nearly 1.3% and France's Cac 40 fell roughly 1.6%.   Gold, which is often seen as a safer investment when the economic backdrop is unstable, rose to another record high, hitting $3,128.06 an ounce.  Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth, told the BBC there could be ""quite a lot of uncertainty"" for a while given that previous tariff announcements have seen a lot of changes subsequently. Japan, which is a big player in exports, is among those countries most at risk from the changes, Ms Keleman said. ""They have a lot of automakers and also a very big presence in the semiconductor market, something that hasn't really been targeted yet but that could change,"" she noted.  Trump sees tariffs - which are taxes imports - as a bargaining chip to get better trade terms, while also raising money and protecting the American economy from unfair competition. A White House fact sheet published last week also suggested that a 10% tariff on every import could create nearly three million US jobs. Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has estimated that all the planned tariffs could raise $600bn annually, about a fifth of the value of total goods imports into the US. Many firms have said they expect the cost of the new tax to be passed onto customers in the form of higher prices.  But that could lead to lower sales and fuel inflation in the US, a problem Trump had pledged on the campaign to tackle.  Conversely, if companies decide to absorb the cost, it will hit their profits.  Will Butler-Adams is chief executive of Brompton Bicycle, which makes folding bikes and relies on the US for about 10% of its sales.  Brompton's products are not facing additional taxes yet.  But Mr Butler-Adams said tariffs would make his bikes less competitive and force him to re-think his presence in the US.  ""We won't continue to invest in the same way that we are now,"" he said. ""We may even shrink; in the extreme, we might pull out."" Mr Butler-Adams said it had been hard to figure out the impact of tariffs that have already gone into effect, which require detailed accounting of how much steel in each item comes from outside the US.  ""The reality is we don't [know] actually and the people who are on the borders importing goods into the US don't actually entirely understand how some of these tariffs might be put in,"" Mr Butler-Adams said. Separately, Trump said a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the  app would be agreed before a deadline on Saturday. He set the 5 April deadline in January for the short video platform to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the US on national security grounds. It had been due to take effect that month to comply with a law passed under the Biden administration. Additional reporting by Dearbail Jordan and Mitchell Labiak"
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cx2xed9mxveo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Officials lobbying for golf to include a mixed competition at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are ""optimistic"" the proposal will be accepted by the International Olympic Committee. A meeting on Monday will hear golf's submission to include a two-day mixed event, which would be staged between the men's and women's individual tournaments. Golf's return to the Games has been judged an overwhelming success. Justin Rose won men's gold for Great Britain in Rio in 2016 in the first Olympic golf tournament for 112 years. In Paris last year world number one Scottie Scheffler snatched a thrilling victory in the men's event, while New Zealand's Lydia Ko claimed the women's title to complete a personal set of gold, silver and bronze medals. But critics said the sport was missing a trick by not having a combined mixed team competition. The International Golf Federation (IGF) has signalled its desire to add an event where one pair from each competing nation would compete in a two-day tournament to be held in the gap between the 60-player individual tournaments. ""We're one of many submissions, but we're hearing very positive things and support from LA28, and also strong support from rights holding broadcasters like NBC for us to have that event,"" IGF executive director Antony Scanlon told BBC Sport.  ""Hopefully, with that support, the submission will be seen in the right light next Monday. ""I've been optimistic the whole time. I wouldn't want to be wasting anybody's time on this. ""It's got fantastic merit, especially coming out of Paris and the great support we've received from all the athletes, male and female."" Ko and Shane Lowry, who carried the Irish flag at the Paris opening ceremony, are among players who are backing the bid. ""It's very compelling as to why we should be part of the programme,"" Scanlon said. ""Even beyond the social and sporting aspect, there's the financial aspect as well - two extra days in LA with minimal operational expense and a big upside in terms of ticketing and revenues from merchandise etc."" To accommodate the extra event, the 72-hole men's tournament would move forward a day and begin on Wednesday and finish on Saturday of the first week of the Games, which are scheduled to begin on 14 July 2028. ""On the Sunday we'll tee up with the mixed and we'll have foursomes, alternate shot. So it's not as taxing on those players that have been playing the day before. On the Monday (of the second week) we'll have fourballs. ""It may sound like a lot of golf, but for an extra medal I think the male and the female players will certainly be up for it."" The women's tournament would begin on the Wednesday. With only one pair per country in the mixed tournament, there will be room for female players not involved to practise on the Riviera Country Club course that will host the tournaments. Scanlon believes the opportunity to win extra medals will be attractive to competitors interrupting their usual schedules to compete at the Games. ""It will showcase just how good our female players are when they're with their male partners,"" he said. ""It will then have the tours start to look at how they can cross-pollinate as to individual events and team events where you have a mixed format. ""If we get it, there will be some positive momentum flow out of that for the sport itself."" The earlier date for the LA Games provides a headache for golf's leading administrators because it clashes with the traditional mid-July spot in the schedule for the last major of the year, The Open. A date and venue for the championship in 2028 has yet to be announced. ""We're working towards a good outcome on that now,"" Scanlon said. A decision on whether golf will have a mixed tournament in 2028 is expected on 9 April. Golf will be one of at least 36 sports to be contested in LA. Five sports - flag football, squash, baseball, cricket and lacrosse - have been added to the schedule."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m90jjewd7o","Three big unknowns ahead of Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs",2025-04-01,"Natalie Sherman","BBC News","Donald Trump says tariffs are coming. That message from the US president has been consistent. But what tariffs and when? Import taxes have come so thick and fast since he took office that it can be hard to keep track.  Trump has already raised duties on Chinese imports, as well as steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico. Higher levies on cars are due to go into effect this week.  We're now waiting for Trump to unveil the details of his plan for a wider set of tariffs, which his team has spent the last few weeks developing.  The White House is calling it ""Liberation Day"". So what might we learn on Wednesday? The White House has not said how high the tariffs could go, although various possible rates have been floated by analysts.  On the campaign trail last year, Trump backed a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports coming into the US, sometimes suggesting that could be 20% - even 60% on imports from China.  Once in office, he introduced the idea of ""reciprocal"" tariffs, suggesting the rates could vary country by country.  ""Very simply, it's if they charge us, we charge them,"" he said in February, shortly before he ordered officials to develop such a plan.  The White House almost immediately complicated the picture, noting that their recommendations would reflect not just tariffs but also other policies they believe are unfair to US businesses, like Value Added Tax (VAT). It has a led to a scramble, as businesses and political leaders try to get a sense of how big a new tax their products might be facing; and how whatever is announced on Wednesday will interact with other duties, such as those on steel and aluminium, already put into effect by Trump. Officials in Europe, for example, are preparing for a double-digit tariff on their exports. Trump earlier this year said he planned to hit goods from the bloc with a 25% import tax. The Trump administration has not confirmed which countries will be hit, although it has trailed Wednesday's announcement as a sweeping one. On Sunday, the president said the new tariffs could apply to ""all countries"", suggesting a possible return to the across-the-board tariff he backed in the campaign. It dashed hopes in some countries, such as the UK, that thought they might float under the radar, though many are still hoping eventually to work out some sort of deal. But it is still unclear to what extent the tariffs will be universally applied or more targeted. Last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said efforts were focused on the ""Dirty 15"" - the 15% of countries that account for the bulk of trade with the US and impose tariffs or other rules that put US firms at a disadvantage. The Office of the US Trade Representative, as it prepared to craft recommendations, identified the countries in which it was  ""particularly interested"". They were Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the UK and Vietnam. Trump himself has reserved some of his harshest criticism for historic allies and major trade partners, such as Canada and the EU. ""Friend has been, oftentimes, much worse than foe,"" he declared last week. Tariffs are taxes on imports. So the big question is, who will pay? Technically, there is a simple answer: the US firms bringing in the goods are the companies that will face the bill, especially if the White House starts levying the tariffs ""immediately"", as spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt suggested on Tuesday.  But the larger the tariffs are, the more firms will be looking for ways to offset those costs, either by changing suppliers, pushing business partners to share the burden - or by raising prices for Americans. Many firms have said they are already preparing for that step. But it is a risky game because if companies raise prices too much, buyers will simply stay away.  The dynamics have raised the risks of an economic recession both in the US - and far outside its borders, where many firms rely on US sales. Trump says companies looking to avoid tariffs can simply do their business in the US, but that's not an immediate, or easy fix, given the high costs of hiring and setting up factories.  Introduce currency swings and retaliation by other countries into the mix, and the repercussions of Trump's bid to reset global trade balances are likely to prove hard to predict long after Wednesday's announcement.

In an X post Friday, Musk said the all-stock transaction values xAI at $80bn (£61.8bn) and X at ""$33billion ($45B less $12B debt)"" Musk added. Musk paid $44bn for Twitter in 2022. ""xAI and X's futures are intertwined,"" Musk wrote on X Friday. ""Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent."" The move may be aimed at protecting investors, who helped him buy X, from losing money. Both X and xAI are privately held and share some major investors. They also share significant resources. ""The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge,"" Musk wrote. XAI has used data from social media posts on X to train its models, and its chatbot Grok is a prominent feature on the platform. ""The move appears sensible, considering the current trend of increased investments in AI, data centres, and computing,"" said analyst Paolo Pescatore, founder of PP Foresight.  Mr Musk has been locked in a legal battle with OpenAI, the company he founded in 2015 with CEO Sam Altman. Last year, Mr Musk sued OpenAI and Mr. Altman for straying from the company's original mission and pushing to transition the startup to a for-profit model. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI was finalizing a $40bn funding round with the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. The outlet also reported the funds are contingent on the company completing its restructuring to a for-profit entity. OpenAI did not respond to a BBC inquiry about the arrangement. Critics say Mr Musk is suing the ChatGPT makers because he wanted to control it. Earlier this year, a consortium led by Mr Musk made an unsolicited $97.4bn takeover bid for OpenAI, which Mr Altman rejected, saying the company is not for sale. The business manoeuvring is happening as Mr Musk has taken more of an interest in politics, now serving as President Donald Trump's right-hand.  He has spearheaded the administration's push to slash federal spending and is spending the weekend in Wisconsin where he has contributed millions to a state Supreme Court race. Wisconsin's attorney general asked a court Friday to block Mr Musk from distributing $1m  checks to voters there ahead of the election. "

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm8vxevyplo","Are Trump's Asia tariffs a 'full-frontal assault' on China?",2025-04-03,"Annabelle Liang","Business reporter","As US President Donald Trump laid out tariffs on virtually every one of America's trading partners on Wednesday, he had strong words for Beijing. ""I have great respect for President Xi [Jinping] of China, great respect for China, but they were taking tremendous advantage of us,"" Trump said during his roughly hour-long address. Holding up a chart listing countries and territories that he said had put up trade barriers to US goods, Trump said: ""If you look at that... China, first row, 67%. That's tariffs charged to the USA, including currency manipulation and trade barriers."" ""We are going to be charging [them] a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34%,"" he added. ""In other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge them less. So how can anybody be upset?"" But China's Commerce Ministry immediately called the move ""a typical act of unilateral bullying"" and pledged to take ""resolute countermeasures to safeguard its rights and interests"". And state news agency Xinhua accused Trump of ""turning trade into an over simplistic tit-for-tat game"". Experts believe Beijing has good reason to be upset. For one, the latest announcement is an add on to existing tariffs of 20% on Chinese goods. Secondly, by imposing heavy tariffs on other South East Asian countries including Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, it has 'slammed the door shut' on how China rejigged its supply chains to get around the tariffs imposed on Beijing during Trump's first term. There were five Asian nations in the 10 countries and territories hit with the highest tariffs.   Trump has imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports since returning to the White House in January, ratcheting up levies to 20%. In less than a week, these tariffs will jump to 54%, apart from on products like cars, steel and aluminium, which will be subjected to lower tariffs. Beijing has also been on the receiving end of other Trump trade salvos. Earlier on Wednesday, the President signed an executive order to end a provision for low-value parcels from China. This had allowed Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu to ship packages with a retail value of under $800 (£617) to the US, without taxes and inspections. Close to 1.4 billion shipments entered the US under the provision in the last financial year, according to customs data. The removal of the exemption could force some Chinese firms to pass the extra cost on to customers, making their goods less competitive in the US. When taken together, this is a worrying picture for Beijing, said Deborah Elms from the Hinrich Foundation consultancy. ""I don't think the new tariffs are necessarily aimed at China. But when the United States stacks tariffs on top of each other, specifically towards China, the numbers become eye-watering quite quickly."" ""China and the Chinese will have to retaliate. They are not going to be able to sit back and watch this,"" she said. Trump also imposed heavy tariffs, ranging from 46% to 49%, on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. This represents ""a full-frontal assault on Beijing's extended supply chain,"" said Stephen Innes from investment firm SPI Asset Management. ""Vietnam... and others in the periphery are collateral damage in what is shaping up to be the most aggressive realignment of US trade policy in a generation,"" he added. ""This isn't tit-for-tat - it's strategic containment via tariff warfare."" Laos and Cambodia, which are among the poorest countries in the region, are heavily dependant on Chinese investment in supply chain infrastructure. The high tariff rates are expected to hit both countries hard.  China is Vietnam's largest trading partner. It was one of the key beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term. In 2018, Trump hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam. This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure. ""Vietnam was clearly targeted [by Trump] due to its role as a conduit for China's circumvention of previous tariffs"", former US trade negotiator Stephen Olson told the BBC. While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data. Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year. Pushan Dutt, a professor at the INSEAD business school, said the new taxes on South East Asia will be ""prohibitive"" for China. ""China has a problem with demand and in the last Trump administration their firms had nimbly reacted to tariffs by rejigging supply chains and moving them to [South East Asian nations]. This door has been slammed shut,"" he added. But Trump's taxes on the region will also impact US companies that manufacture goods in South East Asia. For instance, American businesses including technology giants Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike have large factories in Vietnam. A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed. There is the question of what China can do to respond to the new tariffs, given it only has days before they are due to take effect. Mr Olson said he expects Beijing to have a ""forceful"" response with tariffs and other measures making it more difficult for US companies to operate in China. With the Chinese economy already facing challenges, Beijing faces ""tough choices"" in the days ahead, said Professor Dutt. ""Exporting to other regions threatens de-industrialisation in these destinations - and political leaders there are unlikely to accept this. That means China has to finally unleash domestic demand and the Chinese household,"" he added. The tariffs could also push China to try and build alliances with other Asian nations who have been on the receiving end of the tariffs.  Wang Huiyao, a former China Communist Party member who works with the Center for China and Globalisation think tank, called on Asian countries to ""work together to go through this difficult time and fight protectionism"".  ""In the end, the US could be losing all the influence and isolate itself,"" he added. Some discussions are already underway. China, South Korea and Japan recently held their first economic talks in five years. They agreed to speed up talks for free trade agreement - which was first proposed over a decade ago. The new tariffs could give them added incentive to do so.  However, Beijing could face some short-term pain while talks with Washington take its course. ""Ultimately, the US and China are headed for a negotiating table where they'll try to reach some type of a grand bargain on a wide range of issues,"" Mr Olson said. ""That won't necessarily happen soon and I expect things to get worse before they get better,"" he added."

Trump also said he was willing to extend a 5 April deadline for a non-Chinese buyer of the platform to be found. In January, he delayed the implementation of a law passed under the Biden administration to ban TikTok. The legislation, which was signed into law in 2024, cited national security grounds for the sell or be banned order. ""With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that,"" Trump told reporters on Wednesday. ""Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,"" he added. Trump also said he expected at least the outline of a deal to be reached by the 5 April deadline. In response to the comments, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry said Beijing ""has repeatedly stated its position. China's opposition to the imposition of additional tariffs has always been consistent and clear"". Trump made the comments after announcing new import taxes of 25% on all cars and car parts coming into the US in a move that threatens to widen the global trade war. The BBC has contacted TikTok for comment. The biggest sticking point to finalising a deal to sell the TikTok business, which is worth tens of billions of dollars, has always been securing Beijing's agreement. Trump has previously tried to use tariffs as leverage in the negotiations. On his first day back in the White House, on 20 January, the president threatened more import duties on China if it did not approve a TikTok deal. The hugely popular app is used by around 170 million Americans. Trump, who called for TikTok to be banned in his first term as president, now has an account on the platform.  He has more than 15 million followers and has said he received billions of views on the app during his presidential election campaign. Separately, the US increased levies on all imports from China to 20% this month. That doubled the tariffs Trump imposed on the world's second largest economy on 4 February. On 10 February, China responded with its own tariffs, including a 10-15% tax on some US agricultural goods. Beijing has also targeted various US aviation, defence and tech firms by adding them to an ""unreliable entity list"" and imposing export controls. The 10% levy doubled to 20% on 4 March. China has urged the US to return to dialogue with Beijing as soon as possible."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx1rl8dk2o","The Swedish city fined for missing an environmental target",2025-03-31,"MaryLou Costa","Business reporter","Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line. Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a ""sustainability linked loan"" or SLL. This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks. Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods. Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; £8,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount. In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner. However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined. Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set ""ambitious"" targets. ""You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030. ""We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things."" The improvements to the city's poorest areas – and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness. Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations. Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously. ""For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,"" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall. ""We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us. ""I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything."" But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase. ""What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?"" she says. ""What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes."" Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas. ""People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,"" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child. Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved. Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg. Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL. He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one. ""It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,"" he says. ""You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job. ""It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy."" One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed £10m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world. Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs. By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer. ""If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment. ""It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals."" Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make. ""Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,"" he says.

"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250228-how-italy-and-chile-foiled-an-1m-international-smugglers-cactus-heist","Operation Atacama: The $1m cactus heist that led to a smuggler's downfall",2025-03-10,"Sofia Quaglia","","After thousands of rare Chilean cacti were found in the house of an Italian collector, a years-long trial slowly unravelled how they got there – and is setting a precedent for dealing with crimes of this kind. At first sight, orange and off-white shards of rocks surrounded by dust and dirt are all you can see for thousands of desolate kilometres in the Atacama Desert of Chile. This is one of the driest places on Earth. Looking around, it feels impossible that any speck of life could survive. But reaching out of nooks in the cracked crust along the desert's coast, there lie thousands of Copiapoa cacti. A cactus group made up of more than 30 species, Copiapoa are found only in Chile. They grow a mere centimetre each year in scorching, breathtaking desert conditions by absorbing the local evening fog, known as camanchaca. These rare, aubergine-shaped succulents exemplify life's ability to adapt to extremes – one of the traits that has made them highly sought after by plant collectors. They've also just been at the heart of a landmark trial over an international cactus heist that might revolutionise how biodiversity crimes are dealt with the world over. Ranging from dark grey to blueish-green, and from the size of a coin to that of a small car, Copiapoa have thick dark spines along their geometrical ridges. Their fluffy friars head flowers white, yellow and sometimes orange once a year. While they might look unassuming at first, their beauty, resilience and rarity have certainly not been lost on Andrea Piombetti. A well-known personality in the Italian plant world, Piombetti has been cactus collector and trader for decades and is said to take great pride in his unique knowledge of the realm. His Facebook profile picture is a rugged backpack sitting on top of a cluster of cacti in the field. His WhatsApp status reads: ""The King of the Cactus Pirates"". He's been spotted clad in a jacket with ""The King of Chile"" printed on its back. When called on his mobile number for this story, though, he refused to comment and hung up without saying a word. His lawyers were also contacted, but refused to comment. In 2013, customs at Milano Malpensa Airport intercepted an unusual shipment of 143 cactus plants with visibly suspicious forged phytosanitary documents directed straight to his house in Senigallia, Ancona. Upon further inspection, police found even more boxes of cacti at his home and the home of a friend in a town nearby. The team's botany expert was able to rapidly identify the cacti were Copiapoa, many of older than Piombetti himself. Soil forensics soon found they had been illicitly extirpated from their natural habitat in Chile and had no business in this man's home. Police issued an internal police warning across Europe about the discovery and the Italian government initiated prosecution. The case's statute of limitations, however, expired before the case verdict. The case was dropped, and Lt Col Simone Cecchini, chief of the trade of endangered species unit of the local police force, believed any illicit trading had ceased. But when Cecchini returned to Piombetti's home again in February 2020, after receiving a complaint the collector had allegedly snuck out a rare sapling from a local nursery owned by botanist Andrea Cattabriga, Piombetti was resistant to letting the police into his home. He barricaded himself for about 10 minutes, says Cecchini. Police did not find the rare sapling there, but once they gained entry what they found started a ""much more interesting"" case, says Cecchini. More than 1,000 Copiapoa cacti sat on Piombetti's veranda and in another locked room that he initially told police he'd lost the key for, together with other rare cacti. ""It was by chance,"" says Cecchini of the discovery. Piombetti also said he'd lost his passport, but police soon found it had been slid on top of his wardrobe. ""He'd maybe thrown it there in a rush,"" says Cecchini. The document confirmed he'd visited Chile five times between 2016 and 2019. Records found on his laptop and mobile helped police identify a close local accomplice, Mattia Crescentini, as well as a network of 10 other illegal plant traders and 10 regular buyers. The plants were usually sold online through specialised auction websites and bought by people with private ornamental collections all over the world. Crescentini posted his cactus on an Instagram account called Cactus_Italy. A Japanese buyer who works in the fashion industry, for instance, had been sending Piombetti sums of €2,500 (£2,100/$2,600) each month. Piombetti was also buying plants himself for hundreds of dollars. The stolen plants discovered on that day were valued by the police at higher than €1m (£800,000/$1.1m). Pictures of the crime scene were sent for plant identification – including to Cattabriga, who is local cactus expert. ""These were incredible plants, they were ancient plants, hundreds of years old,"" says Cattabriga. Piombetti is known for having a keen, selective eye for high-quality specimens and precise collective methods, Cattabriga says. ""They were perfect."" Forensic botanists from the botanical garden of Milan ran soil analyses to confirm that about 1,000 Copiapoa plants had been illicitly extracted straight from the Atacama Desert, and several hundred smaller, juvenile plants had been grown and propagated from seeds collected during those extirpation stints. While seed collecting in the wild is not illegal in Chile, removing and exporting plants without proper documentation is. In Italy, importing plants into the country without documentation is illegal, while Copiapoa are also protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites). The cacti had been shipped from Chile to Greece and Romania, then to Italy. Another seizure in November 2020 found more illegally traded cacti from the United States, Mexico and Argentina. The case was dubbed Operation Atacama and has become known as one of the largest illegal cactus operations to date in Europe. As a result, the Italian government initiated a new prosecution against Piombetti and his accomplice in 2020 for breaking the Cites convention. The ensuing five-year trial, which ended in January 2025, resulted in many firsts in the history of biodiversity crimes. For one, after being seized by the police, about 840 of the stolen Copiapoa were sent back to Chile. ""This is biodiversity patrimony, and it should go back to Chile. It wasn't even a question for me what should have been done with the plants,"" says Barbara Goettsch, co-chair of the IUCN SSC Cactus and Succulent Plants Specialist Group. She helped design a protocol for the plants to be safely repatriated, quarantined and safeguarded. ""I don't know of any other case where plants have been sent back to their country,"" says Goettsch. ""I think it was definitely a success."" The cacti are now in an Atacama Desert greenhouse managed by the National Forest Corporation of Chile (Conaf), although some local reports suggest some of the plants may have gone missing. Conaf did not respond to a request for comment about their status, and said it could not grant the BBC access to the greenhouse until April 2025. Despite their extreme resilience – having survived trips to the other side of the world and back – the confiscated plants will never truly return home. They cannot be reintroduced into the wild as there are no records of which areas they came from in the first place. They will likely be used for genetic and botanical research and propagation experiments. In the meantime, Goettsch's team has developed the nation's first Copiapoa conservation action plan to strategise future safeguarding efforts in the wild, set for official publication in March 2025. After hours of walking in the Atacama Desert, it becomes almost difficult to breathe. Yet Mauricio Gonzalez and Rodrigo Castillo, two middle-aged men each with a slight limp in their walk, are climbing the huge desert hills questing for their beloved Copiapoa. ""This one is maybe 100 years old,"" Gonzalez says, pointing at a girthy cactus leaning crooked to the left, sprouting out of a crack in the chapped land. Gonzalez and Castillo are part of the Caminantes del Desierto (desert walkers) a group of volunteer educators who spread awareness of desert flora and fauna in the Chilean region of Antofagasta. Copiapoa is one of their favourite cacti to encounter. ""They've evolved over years and years and years to adapt to this territory,"" says Gonzalez, the president of the group. Piombetti is far from the only cactus connoisseur with an interest in these rare succulents. The Caminantes say many less-experienced locals get contracted online by international collectors and get sent to rob the Copiapoa in bulk. They can end up eradicating any and all plants they find along the way, often leaving some uprooted ones on the path behind them. At least three or four times a year, the Caminantes find some of their favourite trails have been wiped out completely. Whenever they post a picture from one of their walks, they field hundreds of ill-intentioned messages on social media.  ""There are trends, this year Copiapoa atacamensis is the most fashionable,"" says Gonzalez, whose usual trail includes sightings of the species atacamensis, cineria and the rarer solaris. ""We see it very clearly, once somebody has it, everybody else wants to have it too. Sometimes the volunteers hide their favourite plants under rock slates to conceal them from potential poachers. Since the cacti tend to have highly localised endemisms with small populations found only in specific sites, poachers can wipe out a whole species with a couple of flicks of a chisel, they say. An increase in road construction and irregular housing has allowed more and more people to access the harsh and secluded desert habitat where Copiapoa live. ""You open the window for poaching,"" says Pablo Guerrero, a cactus researcher at the Universidad de Concepción in Chile. Social media has also made it easier for collectors to find each other, while regulation and enforcement are much slower to catch up. ""Most countries in the world are very naive in the face of this kind of poaching,"" says Guerrero. ""They say, 'They're plants, who cares, they're cacti, they all look the same'."" Poaching is not the only threat facing Copiapoa. Most of the cacti we encounter on this daytime expedition are dying. They are shrivelling up, collapsing onto themselves and turning black like ash due to the desert's rising temperatures, fluctuations in rainfall patterns and rapid changes in moisture patterns along the coast. The camanchaca fog is changing trajectory, and Copiapoa is now becoming a legacy of millennia when the environment was different from today's. Changes in land use and the expansion of the local mining industry also pose a threat to the plants. The Caminantes organise yearly cactus watering tours, but it's little in the face of the desert's extended droughts. ""Yeah this one is dying,"" says Castillo, nudging a dark, deflated sack of spines. ""This one too."" Research by the scientists Guerrero and Goettsch found that 76% of all Copiapoa species are endangered due to climate change and illegal trafficking. ""They are in very rapid decline,"" says Guerrero ""Some will go extinct in the wild soon, it is very dramatic."" The raid and ensuing court case didn't stop Piombetti. In September 2024, while still pending judgement in Italy, he flew to Chile one more time. He was arrested at the airport upon landing in Santiago, as he was now also wanted for illegal wildlife trafficking in Chile. Cecchini says a Chilean prosecutor reached out to him personally on WhatsApp after hearing about the repatriation of the smuggled cacti in February 2024, and as a result he initiated a case against Piombetti. The collector underwent a fast-tracked trial in an Atacama court and Chilean authorities fined him 5,000,000 pesos (£4,200/$5,300) and banned him from entering the country for 10 years. Such ban from the country is likely the most effective deterrent from future smuggling, Cecchini says. On 31 January 2025, the Italian court issued a first-instance decision, seen by the BBC, against Crescentini and Piombetti. It sentenced Piombetti to 18 months' imprisonment and a fine of €25,000 (£21,000/$26,000) and Crescentini to 12 months' imprisonment and a fine of €18,000 (£15,000/$19,000). The verdict was published on 14 February and the defendants now have 30 days to appeal. For biodiversity experts, though, the court case also produced another ground-breaking outcome. The court recognised that Piombetti's crime wasn't just against the law; it was against nature. The cactus conservation organisation Associazione per la Biodiversità e la sua Conservazione (ABC), founded by Cattabriga, was included in the case as an affected civil party. Piombetti and his accomplice now have to pay an additional €20,000 (£17,000/$21,000) in civil remedies to ABC as reparations for the damage done to their conservation work. The funds will be directly invested into cacti research, awareness and conservation, according to Cattabriga. ""We're giving to plants a right, a right to not be destroyed, because they are beings,"" says Cattabriga. More like this: • The rewilded golf courses teeming with life • Why some animals thrive on being alone • The farmers protecting Nepal's snow leopards Too often nature itself doesn't get any justice in crimes against biodiversity, says Jacob Phelps, a lecturer in tropical environmental change and policy at Lancaster University and co-founder of the biodiversity law organisation Conservation-Litigation.org, which consulted on the case. The case outcome sets a precedent to create a system of retribution for the harm caused to the environment, he says. Some similar verdicts have been reached in the past. For instance, in 2019 a French national park received compensation for ecological harm caused by fish poachers, and in 2021 an Indonesian environmental non-profit sued a local zoo for keeping protected species at its zoo without legal permission. ""But they are rare,"" says Phelps. There is an under-explored option to have biodiversity organisations ""act like the Lorax and speak for the trees"", says Phelps, who wrote a paper describing these legal frameworks in the journal Conservation Letters. ""These types of legal provisions exist in loads of countries, but they've never been used, or if they've been used, they've been used erratically… This case is really important because it shows us that we can do this."" In an effort to replicate such success, Phelp's team already has similar cases under development at various stages in Uganda, the Philippines and Indonesia. ""It's slow to convince the government to have the courage to use this,"" says Phelps. ""But we think of this as a new wave of green litigation."" But Gonzalez and Castillo, as they patrol the desert as volunteer custodians of the Copiapoa, are hesitant about its future. ""I don't believe in fairytales,"" says Gonzalez, lighting himself another cigarette halfway through the trek. ""I tell it how it is."" While the volunteers hope the trial's outcome can help raise awareness of the dangers of wildlife poaching, they know the verdict is far from a silver bullet. During our afternoon trip in the desert, we only meet four other cars. Anybody could hop out of their vehicle and slice up millions of years of species evolution, adaptation and resilience. They'd go unnoticed. And droughts will continue to shrink up the plants from their insides no matter how many times the Caminantes walk out into the open desert with their watering cans. Still, there is excitement in their eyes as the sun starts to set and they reach their final destination of the day. In a dip between two hills of the coast, where the camanchaca fog is so thick above us it feels like the sky has dropped closer to the Earth, there are Copiapoa everywhere. This whole Western slice of land is freckled with the rare succulents. Some have up to 20 thick, water-filled branches and others flaunt small baby ones just a couple of years old. Several have flowered in the past couple of days and others are on the brink of their next bloom. ""We've found one,"" says Castillo, pointing to a Copiapoa being pollinated by a small red ant, right as we peek inside its blossom. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

The idea of Butterflies is to allow human and AI personas to interact. Mr Springett's online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection. He said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation. ""I didn't engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,"" Mr Springett told BBC. ""It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn't pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching."" A host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants. According to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X's daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024. And it's not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb. A report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago. Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground. Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X. Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization. Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community. Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the ""popular with friends"" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about. It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield. He ways it will have to strike a balance between ""generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done"". Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that. It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (£23m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky. ""Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,"" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, ""but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest"". A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads. The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services. Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law. They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.  Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them. Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance. Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms. It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol. But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech. ""One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,"" says Mr Berjon. At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents. In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped. One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all. Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person. ""Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,"" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson. Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices. He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube. ""In the end,"" says Mr McCue, ""it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more."""

International pro-vice chancellor Caroline Baylon said the current funding model of universities in the UK relied on students from overseas. Home Office statistics show 14% a drop in student visa applications in the 2023/24 year compared to the previous 12 months. The Department of Education said the government had taken ""tough decisions to bolster universities' financial sustainability"" but immigration also needed to be reduced. There is no cap on charges for students from overseas so fees can be much higher and they have become a vital income stream. But student visa rules were tightened by the last Conservative government to try to reduce immigration and that led to a fall in applications last summer. ""We wouldn't be able to run on just the funding that we receive from the government and UK tuition fees,"" Ms Baylon said.  ""We wouldn't be top 200 if we couldn't attract top talent from around the world. ""University of Reading is still a British university - 80% of our students are from the UK but having that mixing of culture on campus brings such a different experience."" She explained international students positively impacted Berkshire's local economy.  ""We would lose greatly if we didn't have that post cultural investment but also financial investment,"" she said. Ms Baylon said that the university worked with agents and had offices and colleagues working to encourage international students to come to the UK through bursaries and scholarships.  ""The vast majority [of students] go back after two years of graduating,"" she said. ""As the years go, more and more go back home and those who stay are usually in full time employment."" According to Universities UK, nationally nearly two-fifths return home immediately after graduating.  A Universities UK spokesperson said: ""The UK is a top destination for international students, and this reflects the strength of our sector and its global reputation for excellence. ""International students bring enormous economic, social and cultural contributions to the UK, and enhance our influence around the world."" Ms Baylon said: ""Our [international] students, once they finish studying with us most of them return back home and become great allies to the UK and for our institution."" The Home Office said: ""We have been clear that international students will always be welcome.""  But a spokesperson added that net migration levels in recent years had been ""unacceptable"" and they want to ""restore order to our broken immigration system"".

The movie has taken an estimated $87.3m (£67.5m) globally during its opening weekend, according to Box Office Mojo. Almost half of that figure came from North America. But it is below expectations for a film that reportedly cost more than $270m. The reworking of the 1937 feature length animation had seemed like a surefire hit before running into a series of controversies ahead of its release. The revamp of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs became a flashpoint for social and political divisions, even before it reached cinemas around the world. That included some criticism of the casting of Rachel Zegler, who is of Colombian descent, as the heroine. There was also a backlash about Zegler's pro-Palestinian comments and about pro-Israel comments by Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen.  And there is an ongoing debate about whether there should have been dwarfs in the film at all, live or computer-generated imagery (CGI). In mainland China, Snow White ranked outside the top five movies in cinemas, according to EntGroup's China Box Office website. In the country of more than 1.4 billion people, it brought in less than a $1m in its first three days in cinemas. ""I suspect that the multiple controversies have dulled the film's appeal,"" entertainment industry consultant Patrick Frater told the BBC. ""That and the waning impact of many Hollywood productions in Asia which we have seen since the beginning of the pandemic.""  On the reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Snow White has a critics' score of just 44%, although the audience reaction 'Popcornometer' stands at 73%. The Observer’s chief film critic Wendy Ide described it as “toe-curlingly terrible”, but the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film ""mostly captivating"". With its creepy CGI dwarfs and muddled tone, Disney's latest live-action remake is ""not calamitous"" but is ""a mind-boggling mash-up"",  the BBC's Nicholas Barber said."

The company will now attempt to sell itself under the supervision of a court.  23andMe said in a press release that it plans to continue operating throughout the sale process and that there ""are no changes to the way the company stores, manages, or protects customer data."" The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data protection watchdog, said on Monday it had notified the company of its intent to hand down a £4.59m fine over a 2023 data breach. The ICO, which launched a joint investigation with Canada's data watchdog into the genetic testing company last June, said the findings were provisional. And deputy commissioner Stephen Bonner said the regulator was aware of the company's bankruptcy filing in the US and ""monitoring the situation closely"".  ""As a matter of UK law, the protections and restrictions of the UK GDPR continue to apply and 23andMe remains under an obligation to protect the personal information of its customers,"" he said. The Attorney General in 23andMe's home state of California issued a consumer alert on Friday advising customers to delete their data from the site given the company's ""reported financial distress."" 23andMe's saliva-based test kits were once celebrated among customers and investors, who helped to push the company's value as high as $6bn (£4.6bn). But it has been struggling for survival. Founded in 2006, the company went public in 2021 but has never turned a profit.  In September, the firm settled a lawsuit alleging that it failed to protect the privacy of nearly seven million customers whose personal information was exposed in a 2023 data breach.  In some cases, hackers gained access to family trees, birth years and geographic locations, by using customers' old passwords. The data stolen did not include DNA records, according to the company. Two months after the settlement, it cut 200 employees, amounting to 40% of its workforce.  23andMe said its finance chief, Joe Selsavage, will take over as interim chief executive.  Ms Wojcicki will continue to serve as a member of the board. She had tried to take the company private but was not open to a third-party takeover. 23andMe - which once had high-profile endorsements from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria, and Snoop Dogg - struggled to redefine its business model.  Customers did not have much to return for once they had paid for a DNA report, and an effort to launch a subscription service proved unsuccessful.  Efforts to use its massive trove of data to move into drug development also faltered. All of the company's directors, except for Ms Wojcicki resigned last summer, saying in a letter they were quitting after not receiving a satisfactory buyout offer from her.  In its statement on Sunday, 23AndMe's board chair Mark Jensen said the company is ""committed to continuing to safeguard customer data and being transparent about the management of user data going forward"". He said it would be ""an important consideration in any potential transaction"". But this may not ease concerns of some users about what happens to the DNA they  shared with the company. In the UK, it is considered special category data under data protection laws. This provides legal protections if a firm goes bust or changes hands. When a DNA testing company called Atlas Biomed appeared to have ceased trading  last year, some customers were left with more questions than answers about what it meant for them. Prof Carissa Veliz - author of Privacy is Power - previously told the BBC it is arguably the most valuable personal data you have. ""If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,"" she said.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e728zelxko","Numbers drop in overseas student applications",2025-03-24,"Simon Spark","BBC News","The University of Lincoln is joining other universities across the country calling for the government to reconsider its decision to impose visa restrictions on international students. The restrictions, introduced at the start of 2024, prevents some students from bringing their families with them to the UK. The government said the new rules were part of measures to curb immigration. The university said it had seen a 51% drop in allocations from international students since the changes were applied. Student Raha Fazlollahei, from Iran, said it was ""really heartbreaking"" to be so far away from her family, but said it was also an opportunity to be independent. She said: ""It helps me to grow to be independent and I really like this. I'm 22 right now and at this age I can be on my own."" It is costing her more than £30,000 per year to study creative writing here, but said it was worth it to build her dream life. The university, like most, said it relied on international student fee income to compensate for the freeze on home tuition fees. It said international student applications fell from 2,995 in 2023-24 to 1,460 in 2024-25. Nationally, Home Office figures showed the 393,125 visas that were granted in 2024 represented a 14% drop on the figures from 2023, but that it was still 46% higher than in 2019. ""Removal of the dependents visa has made the UK a less attractive study destination overall in a competitive global marketplace for student recruitment, particularly for international masters students,"" the university said. ""We support sector calls for a more evidence-based approach to international students in national immigration policy, which recognises the need to manage true migration without jeopardising the economic and societal benefits of the UK's standing as a global study destination."" Godswill James, from Nigeria, is studying IT and said although the changes ""had impacted"", there were other contributing factors, such as initial course fee deposits and the cost. It is costing him between £25,000 and £30,000. Fellow student Sibghatullah Karimi, from Afghanistan, believed those figures represented a ""big challenge"" to some countries. He said: ""The students from Asian and African countries, their currency difference is too high, so if we convert that currency, it would be in the millions."" Tsuy Tuong, from Hanoi, Vietnam, said she had dreamt of studying in England since she was 15 and had fallen in love with the British culture. She felt being on her own without family was both a good and bad thing. As well as bolstering the university's income, international students are also important to the local economy, according to Michael Stacey, who is the general manager of Craft bar, which attracts a lot of students. He said: ""They're a massive economic benefit and a massive social benefit. They improve everything. ""I think immigration is what makes our country fantastic. Multiculturalism brings something different and I think if we bunker down and single into our one-lane we're never going to broaden our horizons, we're never going to learn anything new."" It is estimated one in seven at the university are international students. The government has been contacted for comment, but has previously said international students ""will always be welcome but the net migration levels seen in recent years have been completely unacceptable, and we have committed to reducing those numbers substantially"".

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwjxz1e92o","Trump threatens tariffs on buyers of Venezuelan oil",2025-03-24,"Natalie Sherman","BBC News","President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on US imports from countries that purchase oil from Venezuela. Trump described the move as a ""secondary tariff"" aimed at punishing the Latin American country ""for numerous reasons"", including allegedly ""purposefully"" sending gang members to the US. Separately, Trump suggested he was softening his plans for tariffs on imports from other countries, saying he ""may give a lot of countries breaks"". Markets ended the day higher after the comments, which appeared to confirm reports that he was narrowing the taxes he plans to announce on 2 April.  Trump has previously said he was looking to impose ""reciprocal"" tariffs on countries around the world, outlining plans for a system whereby ""they charge us, we charge them"". But on Monday he suggested the White House might be ""nicer than that"" when it came to the new tariff rates. ""We may take less than what they're charging because they've charged us so much, I don't think they could take it,"" he said, while also acknowledging that some countries might be spared from the measures. Leading share indexes in the US, which have fallen steeply in recent weeks following Trump's tariff threats, all rose on Monday.  The S&P 500 closed 1.7% higher, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.2% while the Nasdaq finished 2.2% ahead. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by the company that is buying the goods as opposed to the overseas business that is selling the product.  Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly used tariffs - or the threat of them - in an attempt to gain leverage in a range of disputes, only some of which are related to trade.  He said on Monday he still planned to impose tariffs on specific products, including cars, lumber and computer chips, claiming the possibility of such measures were already helping to spur investment in the US.  His latest threat against Venezuela is expected to raise pressure on current buyers of oil - which include China, India and Spain - to reduce their dealings in the country, which have provided a critical financial lifeline to the Venezuelan government.  Trump has already raised tariffs on Chinese imports to at least 20% since February.  He told reporters he intended the latest announcement to be added on top of existing levies. For Venezuela, China is a major buyer of its oil. But Venezuela is not a big source of crude for China, which imported more than 11 million barrels per day last year.  The US is a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, as a result of exemptions from economic sanctions granted to US oil firm Chevron.  The Trump administration has previously signalled its intention to end those exemptions. On Monday, the administration updated its order, giving Chevron until 27 May to wind down its operations in Venezuela, extending the deadline by two months. Chevron declined to comment.  Oil prices rose more than 1% after the announcement."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1jpjp5506xo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Celtic goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel is set for a spell on the sidelines after injuring his shoulder on international duty, boss Brendan Rodgers has confirmed. The 38-year-old picked up the knock during Denmark's Nations League quarter-final second-leg loss in Portugal, but Rodgers is unsure of the extent of the injury. The Danish captain, who has 81 caps, played on in Sunday's 5-2 loss which meant the Portuguese progressed 5-3 on aggregate. Asked if Schmeichel's season could be over, Rodgers replied: ""Don't know. We don't know how long he'll be out.  ""We're still waiting to hear on that. He's obviously got some issues with his shoulder."" Schmeichel's display in Portugal, which included saving a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty, attracted flak over his fitness in the Danish media, some of which led to complaints from the country's players' union. ""All I know is the reason I brought him here, knowing him so well, is because he's still a top-class keeper,"" said Rodgers. ""If you look at his performance level for us over the course of the season, he's been absolutely brilliant. In big games, he's made big performances. And for me, he still has that hunger and that desire to play. ""When criticism comes as a coach, manager, player, sometimes it's not civil. Sometimes, it's personal, sadly. ""But I know his character and mentality, and I know how determined he'll be to come back."" Viljami Sinisalo, signed in the summer from Aston Villa around the time Schmeichel arrived from Anderlecht, will deputise at home to Hearts on Saturday. The Finland international has made only one cup appearance for Celtic so far. Of Sinisalo, Rodgers commented: ""He's a very talented young goalkeeper. He was very, very good pre-season. ""He's been outstanding in training in what we've seen. I've seen him grow and develop. I've got no qualms of putting him in."" Callum McGregor missed Celtic's last game, the 3-2 home loss to Rangers, but the captain and fellow midfielder Paulo Bernardo as well as winger James Forrest and defender Auston Trusty are back in Rodgers' squad. However, defender Liam Scales is not quite ready to return following a recent surgery."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy83djkz2n1o","Why are tech stocks so volatile?",2025-03-27,"Jonty Bloom","Business reporter","We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar? No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter ""A"". We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same. A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector. Tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls. A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run. ""If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,"" says Prof Dimson. ""But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying."" Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares. Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits. As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: ""Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements."" But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on ""not jam today but jam tomorrow"". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future. So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse. On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends. That means as Prof Dimson puts it, ""that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value"", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time. ""You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,"" he says. ""This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared."" Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the ""magnificent seven"" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla. So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq? Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals. There is simply no guarantee that today's ""magnificent seven"" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms. Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors. Meanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals. The instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing. AI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right. Or as Prof Dimon puts it: ""At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough."" And not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. ""AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on."" That means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead. Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the ""booming"" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks. In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last. It is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile."

Emma-Rae travelled to Belfast from Newry to take part in a march for International Women's Day. The 13-year-old and her friends from the Yew Gen youth group in County Down waved banners with 'empower women' slogans and Chappell Roan lyrics. She told BBC News NI that she wanted to help spread the word that ""women's rights are human rights"". She said learning self-defence had made her feel ""a lot safer"" in a world that felt unsafe for women and girls. Ending violence against women and girls was one of the main messages of the rally in Belfast, which was calling for peace across the globe, as well as closer to home. Helen Crickard, of Reclaim the Agenda, which organised the march, said: ""We want women not just to feel safe, but to be safe."" She said one of the aims of the march was to call on people to recognise, call out, and change bad behaviours towards women. Angus was among the many hundreds who took part.  He said he wanted to do whatever he could to show his support. ""I have a lot of friends who don't feel safe going out at night or going into the city because they're afraid of being attacked or being harassed,"" he said. Meanwhile, Ani Kanakaki from the Imagine Peace Barriers Project in north Belfast said poverty was another issue that affected women ""disproportionately"". ""Poverty is a kind of violence against women because it affects them disproportionately,"" she told BBC News NI. ""Women in working class areas need investment. We need more education programmes; we need more funding; more training opportunities; childcare; we need more resources to help support women to grow and survive."" Janice Beggs, from north Belfast said it was important for people to gather for the march to ensure women don't ""suffer in silence"".  ""Together we are stronger,"" she said."

The Shenzhen-based firm says revenue rose by 29% to come in at 777 billion yuan ($107bn; £83bn), boosted by sales of its hybrid vehicles. This topped the $97.7bn reported by Elon Musk's Tesla. BYD has also just launched a lower-priced car to rival Tesla's Model 3, which has long been the top selling EV in China. It comes as Tesla faces a backlash around the world over Musk's ties to US President Donald Trump, while Chinese carmakers have been hit with tariffs in Western countries. BYD sold around the same number of EVs as Tesla last year – 1.76 million compared to 1.79 million, respectively. But when sales of the Chinese company's hybrid cars are taken into account it is much bigger, selling a record 4.3 million vehicles globally in 2024. On Sunday, BYD announced a new model to take on Tesla. Its Qin L model has a starting price in China of 119,800 yuan, while a basic version of Tesla's Model 3 is priced at 235,500 yuan. It comes as Chinese consumers are cutting spending in the face of economic challenges, including a property crisis, slowing growth, and high local government debt. Last week, BYD's founder Wang Chuanfu announced new battery charging technology, which he said could charge an EV in five minutes. That compares with around 15 minutes to charge a Tesla using its supercharger system. In February, BYD announced that its so-called ""God's Eye"" advanced driver-assistance technology would be available free in all its models. Shares in the firm, which is backed by veteran US investor Warren Buffett, have jumped by more than 50% so far this year. A backlash against Musk and his carmaker has gathered momentum since he was appointed head of the Trump administration's Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been tasked with slashing federal government spending. Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, including giving his backing to far-right party Alternative für Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election and criticising UK politicians such as Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Meanwhile, China's EV manufacturers have been targeted with tariffs in large parts of the world, including the US and the European Union."

The allegation was part of a legal case filed in a US court by Ben & Jerry's that says Unilever violated a merger agreement by trying to silence its ""social mission"". It comes a month after the ice cream company accused Unilever of demanding that it stops publicly criticising US President Donald Trump. A Unilever spokesperson said it is ""disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public"". It said it had made ""repeated attempts to engage the [Ben & Jerry's] board and follow the correct process"". The filing with the US District Court for the Southern District of New York said Unilever had ""repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry's personnel, including CEO David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's efforts to silence the social mission"".  Ben & Jerry's has long been known for taking a public stance on social issues since it was founded in 1978 by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield. It has often backed campaigns on issues like LGBTQ+ rights and climate change. The ice cream maker was bought by Unilever in 2000 through a merger agreement that created an independent board tasked with protecting the ice cream brand's values and mission.  But Unilever and Ben & Jerry's have been at loggerheads for a while. Their relationship soured in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's announced it was halting sales in the West Bank. The dispute escalated over the last year as Ben & Jerry's advocated for a ceasefire in Gaza. In November, the ice cream company filed a lawsuit saying Unilever had tried to stop it from expressing support for Palestinian refugees. Last month, in another court filing, Ben & Jerry's said Unilever had tried to ban it from publicly criticising Donald Trump. Mr Stever has been with Ben & Jerry's since joining the firm in 1988 as a tour guide. He was appointed chief executive in 2023.

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cwygdvpl88ko",NA,NA,NA,NA,"World Athletics has approved the introduction of a test to determine if an athlete is biologically female. Those wishing to compete in women's competition will need to complete the ""pre-clearance requirement"" once in their career. While no timeline has been officially confirmed, the Press Association says that World Athletics is aiming to have it in place for September's World Championships in Tokyo. The move is among several recommendations that have been approved at the World Athletics Council meeting to tighten regulations over the eligibility of transgender and difference of sex development (DSD) athletes. Lord Coe, the governing body's president, said the decision was further evidence that World Athletics would ""doggedly"" protect the female category. ""It's important to do it because it maintains everything that we've been talking about, and particularly recently, about not just talking about the integrity of female women's sport, but actually guaranteeing it,"" he added. ""We feel this is a really important way of providing confidence and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition.""  World Athletics said it was now working to put in place the testing with the timeline to be agreed ""over the next few weeks"". The test will look for the SRY gene which is part of the Y chromosome and causes male characteristics to develop. A cheek swab test will determine if SRY is present, while a dried blood spot test could also be used to determine an athlete's testosterone levels. World Athletics said the test was ""a highly accurate proxy for biological sex"" that would need to be taken just once by an athlete during their career. During a consultation, the majority of stakeholders ""agreed that allowing only biological female athletes to compete in the female category was essential to maintaining fairness"", according to World Athletics. Two years ago, World Athletics banned transgender athletes who had gone through male puberty from competing in the female category in international competition. Last month, its working group recommended further steps. This was on the basis of fresh evidence which it said showed there was a ""significant performance gap before the onset of puberty"". In addition, World Athletics will also merge regulations for both DSD and transgender athletes after the working group said new evidence showed testosterone suppression ""can only ever partly mitigate the overall male advantage in the sport of athletics"". The current rules for DSD athletes required them to reduce their testosterone levels to a set level for at least six months to compete in any female category event internationally.  During their meeting in China this week, the World Athletics Council also approved a recommendation that the current sanctions on Russian and Belarusian athletes are ""adequate"". Competitors from the two countries have been banned from World Athletics events, including under a neutral flag, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Athletes have not been able to compete for Russia since November 2015 after state-sponsored doping was uncovered. The doping suspension was lifted in March 2023, but the nation remained banned because of the war in Ukraine. World Athletics said the sanctions ""do not need to be replaced, added to or varied unless either the current circumstances deteriorate significantly or there is a peace agreement"". It added: ""In anticipation of peace at some stage, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) continues to maintain Russian and Belarusian athletes in its International Testing Pool (ITP)""."

The response comes after Sir Keir cut foreign aid spending to fund defence commitments he said were necessary to protect the UK amid uncertainty over the future of the Ukraine war and its implications for European security."

Easton CE Academy, in Bristol is one of 19 schools in the city to have Sanctuary Status, which is awarded after a two-year training programme in supporting refugees and asylum seekers in education. A spokesperson for Bristol City of Sanctuary said the number of schools seeking sanctuary status has risen following unrest in the city last August after the killing of three young girls in Southport. All places of education can apply for the status, with 12 more Bristol schools currently working towards the award. Headteacher Clare Welbourne said lots of the families welcomed at the school have had to make difficult journeys from quite dangerous parts of the world. ""Some of them had professional jobs and nice houses in other parts of the world, but because of the situations of war, or danger, they've had to leave those places and come here and live in much less good situations. ""But those families are really aspirational for their children, they want their children to do well and work hard and that's what we see."" The school, which has around 400 pupils, gained sanctuary status four years ago. One student, from Sudan, said when she first arrived at the school, she would cry all the time and ""wouldn't dare to go into the classroom"". But with support from her teacher she now speaks English ""perfectly fine"" and has enjoyed supporting other students arriving at the school. ""Last year, I had a friend in the year below me from Romania. I didn't speak Romanian so I was friendly to her and used sign language to communicate and we became friends,"" she added. Another student in year 6 said when she first arrived she was ""so anxious and scared because I left my friends and spoke a whole new language"".  But after a short time said she settled in well and is ""very happy"" at school now. Key stage 2 teacher, and language lead, Fahima Miah said the school is unique in that ""every single adult in the school knows how to receive families and the children, who have zero English and is able to support them within the school setting"". The school's motto is ""being different and belonging together"", and the students are encouraged to support each other on their journeys and learn about each others cultures. She said they offer ""a sense of belonging, a sense of safety and hopefully help them feel integrated within their classrooms"", which gives them a strong foundation, particularly important for the times people have to move again with their families, and leave friends behind.  Ms Welbourne said it is a diverse school, it is lovely to work in, and all the children are ""part of our family"". Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The Women's World Group 1, Division B tournament is being staged at the publicly-run venue between 9 and 15 April. Great Britain will face teams from Italy, Latvia, Slovenia, the Republic of Korea and Kazakhstan. The incentive for the winner is promotion up the sport's ladder to Division A. Dumfries has been hosting international tournaments since 2012 which it has been estimated have generated more than £1m for the local economy. Andy French, the general secretary of Ice Hockey UK, said the partnership with Dumfries Ice Bowl and Dumfries and Galloway Council (DGC) over the past decade had been hugely successful. He said the latest contest also represented an important moment for the GB women's ice hockey team. ""I think it might be the time we need to move up a level,"" he added. One of the game's rising stars is North Ayrshire's Emma Lamberton who is hoping to earn her place in the GB squad for the forthcoming championships. She is looking to make the step up into the senior ranks after helping the British team win gold at the Women's Under 18 Championships in Riga in January. The 17-year-old from Ardrossan, who is a forward with Whitley Bay Beacons, will travel with the national squad to Dumfries. She said it would be a dream come true to make it into the starting line-up. ""I've got a one-in-four chance and have been playing well,"" she said. Emma is also keen to encourage more girls into ice hockey which she describes as a ""tough but very rewarding"" sport. DGC said it was ""genuinely thrilled"" to be hosting the event featuring competitors ""who have reached the pinnacle of their sports careers"". It added that it hoped the tournament could also prove ""beneficial economically""."

The US president's deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners will come just days after he hit foreign carmakers with 25% import taxes. Vietnam could be particularly vulnerable to Trump's latest salvo of levies. It has a large trade deficit with the US and has been a beneficiary of firms moving factories out of China to avoid measures announced during his first term in office. While some countries have hit back at Washington, Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Minh Chinh, has suggested that he may take a more diplomatic approach. Speaking in January, he said he was willing to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and ""golf all day long"" if it benefits his country, drawing laughter in the room. And that idea may not be too far-fetched. The Trump Organization is planning to invest billions of dollars in golf courses, hotels and real estate in Vietnam, according to the Reuters news agency. The first project will reportedly be a residential complex with three 18-hole golf courses, which will break ground in May.  The BBC has contacted the company and its Vietnamese partner for comment. But could golf diplomacy really work? Trump has previously said Vietnam was ""worse than China"" and ""almost the single worst abuser of anybody"".  But he has not yet specifically targeted Vietnam with tariffs, even though it has the third largest trade deficit with the US, after China and Mexico.  Analysts say Vietnam is doing well at engaging with Washington - but its efforts may still not be enough to avoid most of Trump's tariff plans. ""The Vietnam PM seems to be taking a page from the book of [former Japanese PM] Shinzo Abe, who built a close personal relationship with Trump over their shared love of golf,"" said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator. ""I would not however expect any special treatment of Vietnam from a policy point of view. Personal relationships are important to Trump, but in this case, I believe his desire to appear tough on trade will win out."" Vietnam has said it doesn't plan to ""restrict trade"" with the US, although it currently taxes some imports from there. The government said this week that it will allow SpaceX, which is owned by close Trump ally Elon Musk, to operate its Starlink satellite internet service in the country on a trial basis. Some analysts see this as one of the measures Vietnam has taken to avoid being hit with US tariffs. Hanoi also said it will lower tariffs on several US imports, including energy and cars, a move aimed at ""improving trade balances"". It came less than two weeks after Vietnamese and US companies signed more than $4bn (£5.4bn) in deals, in areas including oil and gas exploration. Steve Norris from the consultancy Control Risks said ""Vietnam is being careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non-cooperation on trade issues"". This strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach - known as ""bamboo diplomacy"". Like shoots of plants that sway with the wind, Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures. ""If the US were to increase pressure on Vietnam, the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries, undertake advanced machinery purchases, and – capturing the moment – consider access to Vietnam's rare earth minerals,"" Mr Norris said. One big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about China's influence. Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term. In 2018, he hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam.  This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure. Former US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said Vietnam has emerged as a ""destination for major Chinese investment"". While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data.  Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year. ""These are huge red flags for Trump. My expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs,"" Mr Olson said. However, tariffs on Vietnam could impact US businesses such as tech firms Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike, which have moved production lines from China to Vietnam. A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed. The US president believes the levies will boost his country's economy by encouraging more businesses to make goods in the US and bring in billions of dollars of taxes.  But many economists have warned that it could force up prices for American consumers and negatively impact global trade. Washington is also concerned about so-called ""trans-shipments"" - Chinese goods passing through Vietnam on their way to other countries.  US officials have been ""quietly stressing to Vietnam that it must reduce its trade surplus over time and combat the trans-shipment of Chinese goods through the country,"" Mr Norris said. Vietnam's prime minister has said he is confident that his administration can ""handle the relationship with the US"". Now that the South East Asian nation has cut some tariffs on US goods they may be more attractive to Vietnamese consumers, increasing America's share of trade with the country. And then there is golf - playing a game with Trump had worked for the late Japanese leader Shinzo Abe. Abe and Trump established a friendship, which included many golf games over several years. The friendship arguably helped Abe secure tariff exemptions for Japan's critical car industry at the time. For now, it is unclear if Vietnam would really give golf diplomacy a swing. The real test will come next week, when a new slate of Trump's taxes are set to take effect. "

The firm has blamed its financial troubles on a legal battle with its former partner Warner Bros (WB) and a ""failed and costly endeavour"" into the production of independent films and television series. In a bid to mitigate some of its financial problems, Village Roadshow is proposing to sell its extensive film library for $365m (£281m). The company's debts are estimated to be between $500m and $1bn, according to the court documents. Village RoadShow and WB produced and co-owned dozens of films over the years but their relationship soured in early 2022 after the release of the latest Matrix film - The Matrix Resurrections - on the streaming platform HBO Max. Village Roadshow alleged WB had shut it out of its rights to any sequels and prequels of the films the two companies had previously worked on together. ""The WB arbitration has caused the company to incur more than $18m in legal fees, nearly all of which remain unpaid"", chief restructuring officer Keith Maib said in a court filing. That legal battle, according to Mr Maib, has ""irreparably decimated the working relationship"" between the two companies, ultimately ending ""the most lucrative nexus"" for Village Roadshow's historic success. The other issue faced by Village Roadshow was a costly studio business launched in 2018. None of the films or television series independently produced as part of that endeavour delivered any profits. Like other film companies in the US, Village Roadshow also struggled with a slump in demand from the pandemic and the disruption from the strike action by Hollywood actors and writers, which started in May 2023. In December, the Writers Guild of America banned its members from working with Village Roadshow over the company's alleged failure to pay its contributors."

The plan includes a new $5.8bn steel plant in the southern state of Louisiana. Hyundai also said it will expand its American vehicle production and invest billions of dollars in new technology including autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI).  ""This investment is a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work,"" Trump said during the event at the White House on Monday. He added that more tariffs on vehicle imports are likely to be announced this week. Hyundai said the new steelmaking facility will produce more than 2.7 million metric tons of steel a year and create more than 1,400 jobs.  It is expected to make steel for Hyundai's plants in Alabama and Georgia. The announcement also included plans to invest $9bn to boost the firm's production in the US to 1.2 million vehicles a year by 2028. Hyundai also said it had earmarked $6bn to expand partnerships with US firms to develop technologies including self-driving vehicles, robotics and AI. On Wednesday, Hyundai Motor is set to hold an opening ceremony for a new $7.59bn car and battery factory in Georgia. It already has a manufacturing facility in Alabama and its affiliate Kia has a factory in Georgia.  When fully operational, the three plants will have capacity to make a million vehicles a year, the company said. Hyundai also said it would buy $3bn worth of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US. Since Trump's return to power several companies have announced plans to make major investments in the US. But some of the announcements have been reiterations of previously publicised plans. During the Biden administration, Hyundai said it would invest about $10bn in new technology by 2025. The latest announcement came a little over a week before 2 April, when Trump has said he will impose reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world. The new round of import taxes could potentially target Hyundai's home country South Korea, which has a large trade surplus with the US. Last month, Trump ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US. He also extended the levies to include hundreds of metal products from nuts and bolts to drinks cans. In recent weeks, US carmakers, including General Motors and Ford, have been calling on the US president to exempt imports of cars and vehicle parts from new tariffs."

The Welsh government has confirmed the event will happen in Newport on 1 December. Growing the economy was her ""top priority"", the first minister said, and she promised a ""different emphasis"" to previous Welsh Labour leaders. The Welsh Conservatives said Labour, which has led the Welsh government since devolution in 1999, had ""hamstrung"" the economy. Plaid Cymru called the summit a ""gimmick"" to disguise Welsh Labour's lack of economic vision. More than 170,000 people in Wales work for companies that are owned overseas, but Morgan told BBC Wales: ""I think we can get more of that. And that's what this summit is about."" ""I am very ambitious in terms of what I'm hoping to get out,"" she added.  ""I am looking for billions of pounds of investment to come in and thousands of jobs to be delivered. ""This is a process that is going to happen over a number of years, but we are talking to the companies that we want to come already so that we can work up what our ambition is in relation to their investment."" Morgan, who picked up the reins after Vaughan Gething's resignation last summer, said voters had told her they wanted more quality jobs. ""I'm taking my lead from the public because that's what they want to see,"" she said. Asked if it represented a change of direction from helping the least well off, she said standing by people who struggle ""is fundamental socialism which is core to my beliefs, but I think that can go with a jobs and growth agenda"". ""Every leader is going to bring a different emphasis to the role and my emphasis is very much on producing quality jobs because that's how people pay their bills,"" she said. The summit will be at Newport's International Convention Centre (ICC Wales) and the Celtic Manor Resort. The Welsh government is also spending £2.5m to help US technology company Cadence Design Systems open a new base Cardiff, creating 100 jobs. Conservative shadow economy secretary Samuel Kurtz said: ""While Welsh and UK Labour hamstring businesses with a multitude of new taxes from both ends of the M4, the Welsh Conservatives are committed to fixing the Welsh economy, by delivering high-quality education, world-class skills and meaningful support for businesses."" Plaid Cymru economy and energy spokesperson Luke Fletcher called the investment summit a ""gimmick"" to disguise Welsh Labour's lack of economic vision, describing business support in Wales as ""fragmented and dysfunctional"".  ""We need a new, one stop shop for both investors and domestic Welsh businesses to access the information, support and finance they need to grow,"" he added."

The firm said in a statement that its stores and website in the US will remain open as it ""begins its process of winding down"". Forever 21 was once a favourite of young women around the world, but it has struggled to attract customers to its shops because of rising prices and the growing popularity of online shopping. The company filed for bankruptcy protection for the first time in 2019, but a group of investors ended up buying it through a joint venture. ""We have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast-fashion companies... as well as rising costs, economic challenges impacting our core customers,"" Brad Sell, the company's chief financial officer said in a statement. The firm said it would conduct liquidation sales at its stores and that some or all of its assets would be sold in a court-supervised process.  ""In the event of a successful sale, the Company may pivot away from a full wind-down of operations,"" the firm's statement said. Chapter 11 protection postpones a US company's obligations to its creditors, giving it time to reorganise its debts or sell parts of the business.

The fast-fashion retailer was founded in Los Angeles in 1984 by South Korean immigrants.

The technology giant confirmed it had ""reached a resolution"" but rejected the allegations made against it. The case filed in 2021 by former Google employee, Ana Cantu, said workers from Hispanic, Latino, Native American and other backgrounds started on lower salaries and job levels than their white and Asian counterparts. The settlement has been given preliminary approval by Judge Charles Adams of the Santa Clara County Superior Court in California. The case brought by Ms Cantu against Google relied on a leaked internal document, which allegedly showed that employees from some ethnic backgrounds reported lower compensation for similar work. The practice of basing starting pay and job level on prior salaries reinforced historical race and ethnicity-based disparities, according to Ms Cantu's lawyers. The class action lawsuit was filed for at least 6,632 people who were employed by Google between 15 February 2018 and 31 December 2024, according to Reuters news agency. Cathy Coble, one of the lawyers representing them, praised the ""bravery of both the diverse and ally Googlers who self-reported their pay and leaked that data to the media"". ""Suspected pay inequity is too easily concealed without this kind of collective action from employees,"" Ms Coble added. The technology giant denied that it had discriminated against any of its employees. ""We reached a resolution, but continue to disagree with the allegations that we treated anyone differently, and remain committed to paying, hiring, and levelling all employees fairly,"" a Google spokesperson told the BBC. Earlier this year, Google joined a growing list of US firms that are abandoning commitments to principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in their recruitment policies. Meta, Amazon, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walmart and others have also rolled back their DEI programmes. It comes as US President Donald Trump and his allies have regularly attacked DEI policies. Since his return to the White House, Trump has ordered government agencies and their contractors to eliminate such initiatives."

The family of a Boeing whistleblower who took his own life last year has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company. The complaint alleges that John Barnett was subjected to a campaign of harassment, abuse and humiliation after he raised concerns about safety issues. It claims that the conduct of the company was ""the clear, foreseeable cause"" of Mr Barnett's death. Boeing said it was saddened by Mr Barnett's death and extended its condolences to his family. The former Boeing manager was found dead from what police described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the car park of a Charleston hotel on 9 March last year. The 146-page lawsuit has been brought by his mother, Vicky Stokes, and his brothers Rodney and Michael on behalf of his estate. It was filed on Wednesday in the US District Court of South Carolina. It attributes his death to Boeing's actions, including what it describes as a retaliatory campaign by his managers that amounted to a ""hostile work environment"".   ""Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that Boeing's conduct would result in PTSD and John's unbearable depression... Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death,"" it says. It describes Mr Barnett as a dedicated, idealistic worker who ""took his role seriously in protecting the flying public"" and ""believed that he had a personal, legal and moral obligation to ensure… that every possible defect was identified, documented and remedied."" It describes how he was allegedly harassed, denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn and contempt, as well as being removed from investigations he was working on and blacklisted from transferring to other quality control positions within the company. Mr Barnett took early retirement from Boeing in March 2017, at a time when the claim says he had been suffering from symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, and knew he was going to be fired. The lawsuit alleges the company continued to put pressure on him, for example by preventing friends who continued to work there from having any contact with him. Among the exhibits put forward in support of the claim are an email, in which he says, ""Boeing has completely destroyed my outlook on life"" and his handwritten final note, which says ""I can't do this any longer!! Enough!!"" John Barnett worked for Boeing for 32 years.  From 2010, he was employed as a quality manager at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility builds the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes. During his time at the factory, Mr Barnett raised a number of concerns with management about violations of safety procedures, as well as about defects in aircraft on the production line. He later took his concerns to the media. In 2019, he told the BBC that: Boeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns. It established that the location of at least 53 ""non-conforming"" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action. On the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had ""identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly"". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft. Safety standards at Boeing have come under a harsh spotlight since an incident last year in which a disused door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max aircraft shortly after takeoff.  The incident, which came five years after two previous catastrophic accidents involving the 737 Max, brought intense scrutiny of the company's quality control procedures and conditions in the factory.  The company appointed a new chief executive last year, industry veteran Kelly Ortberg, and has produced a detailed action plan to address concerns raised by regulators about issues on the factory floor. In response to the lawsuit being filed, Boeing issued a brief statement.  ""We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family,"" it said. Previously, however, the company has pushed back against the allegations made against it, telling the BBC: ""Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety."" It also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law. It added: ""We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously."" If you have been affected by the issues in this story, you can find support from the BBC's Action Line."

London Higher said one cohort of international students generated £9.6bn for the capital's economy.  Home Office statistics indicate there was a drop of 14% in student visa applications in the 2023/24 year compared to the previous 12 months. So why are students finding London less attractive than they used to? At the Docklands campus at the University of East London (UEL), groups of young people relax in the crisp spring sunshine. Ten thousand international students attend the three sites in Newham, representing 160 different nationalities. Studying in London often represents a substantial investment for their families, and  international students typically pay far higher fees than UK students. Some said high fees and the cost of visas outweigh the positives of London's diverse culture and high earning potential. In London, study-related visas account for nearly 40% of all immigrants, with the highest proportion of international students come from China, India and Nigeria. Joanna Fayemi is from Nigeria and in her final term at UEL. She said she and some of her fellow students are paying fives times more than they would in their home country to get these degrees, ""so it's definitely not an easy process"".  She said it's worth it ""because it's great to have an international degree to my name because back in my home country, international degrees are well-respected."" International students are entitled to apply for a two-year graduate visa after they finish their course. The cost can run into thousands of pounds. Akanksha Kumar stayed in London after her course at City St Georges, part of the University of London.  She is now an account manager for a marketing company, but she said job-hunting had been ""disheartening"" because offers would be retracted once employers found that she needed a sponsored visa. Ms Kumar said: ""A lot of companies have specific quotas for sponsoring visas, which is completely disproportionate to the number of international students who do come into the country."" Net migration - the number of people coming to the UK long term, minus those leaving, includes international students. In an effort to reduce immigration numbers, the government reformed student family visas at the start of the year.  Now, most students are not permitted to bring family members with them to the UK and Home Office figures show student family visa applications fell by 85% from 2023 to 2024. Another alumnus of City St George's, Samson Folarin, returned to Lagos after his Masters degree, to take a job as an editor at a popular Nigerian newspaper. He described himself as ""a passionate Nigerian"". ""I'm passionate about my country, I'm passionate about my journalism job - all I needed to do was to acquire the knowledge, the skills, get the right tools to be able to hold my own government accountable as well."" He said the new rules about student family visas make studying in Britain more difficult. ""For most international students, coming into the UK for a Masters, they do their studying while the dependents work to raise funds to support them.  ""When the UK decides that we don't want dependents, we just want the students, you are taking away the support system."" Between 2011 and 2016, sponsored study visa grants to foreign students were relatively stable at around 200,000 per year. After 2016 the numbers steadily increased, reaching 268,674 in 2019.  Following a fall in numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of visas issued increased sharply, reaching a peak of 498,068 in the year ending June 2023.  The number of visas issued has been decreasing gradually since, falling to 393,125 in 2024. London has the largest concentration of higher education institutions anywhere in the UK, so there is concern the economy will be impacted. Dr Diana Beech, CEO of London Higher said if international student numbers decline in London and the rest of the UK, it could have a detrimental effect on university finances. ""International student fees are a core part of the cross-subsidy towards our world-leading research sector and towards courses that are maybe less popular with home students."" There may also be a more subtle impact - on students gaining soft skills. Vanessa Varvas from UEL said that ""ensuring our classrooms reflect a global economy is really important, so that our students have different life experiences from different cultures from all over the world."" In addition, fewer international students may mean a reduction in trade connections to entrepreneurial countries with young populations, such as India and Nigeria. Ms Varvas said, those that return to their home countries ""become ambassadors for the university"", which can generate future business, trade and investment.  The mayor of London's growth plan states: ""London's universities are critical in providing a pipeline of world-class talent.  ""We will back them to continue to attract international students, as well as supporting a stabilisation in their funding."" Meanwhile the government is under continued pressure to reduce net migration."

Somalian national Ahmed Hirsi, 46, garnered the attention of customs officers at Newcastle International Airport when he arrived on a flight from Dubai with a large amount of luggage, Newcastle Crown Court heard. They found 61 kg of khat, an African plant which is a Class C drug in the UK with a street value of up to £18,390. Hirsi, who has lived in the UK for 21 years, was jailed for eight months suspended for a year after admitting importing illicit drugs. Hirsi landed in Newcastle on 11 October 2023 having started his journey in Johannesburg, the court heard. He told border officials he had been holidaying in South Africa but they were suspicious of the large number of bags he had. They discovered khat, which an expert said was a flowering plant native to Africa which, when consumed, can cause ""excitement, loss of appetite and mild euphoria"". The court heard Hirsi, of Circular Road in Neasden, London had five children and a partner back in Somalia. He was jobless and in receipt of about £36,000 a year in benefits due to having a hip injury, with the rent on his one-bedroom flat also paid for him, the court heard. Recorder Thomas Moran said he did not believe the claims Hirsi had made to officers that the drugs were for personal use or that he did not know it was illegal in the UK. ""I'm in no doubt you were recruited to do this by somebody much more sophisticated than you,"" the judge told Hirsi, who was assisted in a court by a Somali interpreter. Recorder Moran said criminals picked people like Hirsi who were ""unemployed, in poor health and probably desperate for money"". Hirsi must also comply with a six month electronically-monitored curfew between 19:00 and 07:00 and was ordered to pay £150 prosecution costs.

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cgm1kvkner0o",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kirsty Coventry will become the first woman to hold the most powerful role in sport, having been elected the 10th International Olympic Committee (IOC) president at a meeting in Greece.  The Zimbabwean sports minister and double Olympic swimming champion is also the first African and, at the age of 41, the youngest person to take up the position. But her victory is controversial as well as groundbreaking. BBC Sport looks at why. Despite predictions of a close race between the seven candidates and expectations of multiple rounds of voting, Coventry secured an overall majority of the secret ballot after just one round, winning 49 votes out of a possible 97.  Despite being widely seen as the pre-vote favourite, Spanish rival Juan Antonio Samaranch Jnr trailed behind with 28 votes. Lord Coe meanwhile - the highest profile candidate with a CV that boasts overseeing London 2012 and running World Athletics - could only muster a meagre eight votes. Before the vote he and his team had seemed confident that he could secure the job he said he had been in training all his life for. Had they been naive, or had some members told them one thing and done another? A year after Paris 2024 set a milestone as the first Olympics to achieve full gender parity, Coventry's triumph sends a powerful message.  Up until 1981 there were no female members of the IOC and Coventry is only the second woman to run for the presidency.  Her background and relative youth also helps the IOC project a progressive and diverse image at a time when it is trying to ensure the Games remain relevant to younger generations.  As well as being a seven-time Olympic medallist and competing at five Games, Coventry has been an IOC member since 2013, where she has held a number of significant roles. But the nature of her victory - despite a low-key campaign - has led to questions over how it was achieved. IOC insiders that BBC Sport spoke to at the luxury resort of Costa Navarino in Greece, where Thursday's vote took place, all said that Coventry was the preferred candidate of outgoing president Thomas Bach.  The German denied suggestions that he had been directly lobbying on her behalf, and insisted that the process had been fair. On Friday, he said he was ""very much relieved"" to see the result of the vote, calling it ""a demonstration of the IOC as a global organisation with the highest good governance standards"". Whatever the reality, Coventry's success has been widely portrayed as a win for continuity and patronage at the IOC, and for her long-time mentor Bach, and evidence of his influence over an organisation he has ruled since 2013, and with its membership - most of which he has appointed. The result will also intensify scrutiny of the IOC's secretive and highly restrictive election process.  The exclusive organisation - made up of royals, heads of state, former athletes and figures from business and politics - seems resistant to the change that candidates like Coe stood for.  The double Olympic champion was the reform candidate, but his pledge to shake up the IOC clearly did not appeal to many.  At World Athletics, Coe had taken a tougher stance than the IOC on Russian doping and gender eligibility, and introduced the idea of cash for gold medals at Paris 2024, a move that antagonised Bach. The rules require the IOC hierarchy to remain neutral in any presidential election. Coe was magnanimous in the immediate aftermath of defeat, but it was telling perhaps that when I asked him if it had been a fair fight, he simply answered, ""Oh, it's an election."" Coventry has pledged to introduce a blanket ban on transgender women competing in female Olympic competition, insisting that she will protect women athletes and that fairness and safety are paramount. But critics have pointed out that she was also a member of the IOC's executive board when it allowed two boxers who had reportedly failed gender eligibility tests to compete in the women's boxing competition at the Paris 2024 Olympics. While the IOC insisted the fighters were women, and questioned the credibility of the tests, the controversy led to intense scrutiny of the organisation's rules, and threatened to engulf the Games. Coventry's career has been intertwined with politics for years. In 2008, she accepted a $100,000 reward from Zimbabwe's authoritarian leader president Robert Mugabe - given to her in a suitcase - for winning four medals at the Beijing Games. The gift came at a time of severe food shortages and inflation, and the swimmer announced she was giving some of the money to charity. Mugabe's later years in power were marked by violent repression of his political opponents and Zimbabwe's economic ruin. Although at the time Coventry did speak out about the need for change in Zimbabwe, as an athlete she tried to avoid being drawn into politics. In 2018 however she became sports minister for Mugabe's successor - controversial president Emmerson Mnangagwa - known as 'The Crocodile' for his ruthlessness and political cunning. Mnangagwa - who has congratulated Coventry, external - is associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling party since independence in 1980.  In 2023 campaign group Amnesty said his government had ""failed to live up to its promises for change and break with Mugabe's brutal human rights legacy"" and said authorities had ""systematically supressed peaceful dissent"". Last year the United States imposed sanctions on Mnangagwa and other senior officials for corruption and human rights abuses.  Coventry has also faced criticism for her record as sports minister. In 2020 Zimbabwe's stadiums were banned by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) from hosting all international games for substandard facilities. And in 2022, during Coventry's tenure, football's world governing body Fifa banned Zimbabwe from international fixtures over governmental interference in the running of the game.  Coventry's close ties with Mnangagwa will inevitably lead to questions over her suitability to lead the IOC, but last month she defended her role when interviewed by BBC Sport. ""I don't believe you can really create change if you don't have a seat at the table"" she said. ""It's not been the easiest thing but I have had incredible support and we are making a difference. Having to navigate very sensitive issues has definitely given me extra 'armour' if I can put it that way for what [the IOC] will face in in the future, and we're going to have to navigate difficult leaders that have different opinions on things."" Coventry's diplomatic skills are about to be put to the test. She will assume her new role in June at a critical time for the Olympic movement, and amid a tense geopolitical landscape in which sport has become increasingly weaponised. Major challenges could include the potential reintegration of Russia which was banned following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and building a relationship with US president Donald Trump before the next summer Games in Los Angeles in 2028. There are just eight months until the next winter Games in northern Italy, and a host for the 2036 Olympics must be chosen.  Long-term issues include gender eligibility, climate change, doping, and ensuring the Games remain relevant going forward amid a rapidly-changing media and entertainment landscape. Many in Africa will hope that Coventry's success could increase the continent's chances of hosting the Games for the first time.  In November the IOC said it welcomed interest from South Africa, external in hosting the 2036 Games. Competition is expected to come from India and the Middle East. Speaking to the BBC on Friday Michael Payne, the former IOC director of marketing, said: ""There is no doubt that the influence of Africa in world sport will grow because of this appointment."""

Question at heart of Caribbean legal dispute",2025-03-24,"Jacob Evans","Business reporter•@__jacobevans","Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican? That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called ""Jamaica rum"". In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited. The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton and New Yarmouth (which are owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, and Worthy Park Estate. The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets – the EU and the US. It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location. But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business. This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders – the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird). The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI. It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries. And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April. The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard. ""What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,"" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA. Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants. Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that ""we were a little bit puzzled"" by the NRJ's objection. The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism. Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment. The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford. ""The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard."" This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds. The second reason is ""they anchor production in that region"". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese. Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and ""opens up other aspects of history and geography"", citing France's successful wine tourism industry. Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham. Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme. Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur. Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas. The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. ""We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,"" he says. Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded. Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. ""It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,"" he says. And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history. In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms ""with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand"". It concluded: ""When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand."""

The executive order, which uses cold war era legislation, instructs government agencies, including the defence department, to prioritise mining projects as well as providing technical and financial support to boost critical mineral production. It comes as a trade war escalates with China, which has overwhelming control over the supply chain of some critical minerals. Last year, Beijing banned the sale of some critical minerals to the US, forcing American firms to look for other sources of the vital materials. ""Our national and economic security are now acutely threatened by our reliance upon hostile foreign powers' mineral production,"" the executive order said.   ""It is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent."" The order also calls for the speeding up of permits for mining and processing projects as well as instructing the US Department of the Interior to prioritise mineral production on federal land. Despite having some critical mineral deposits, the US relies heavily on other countries for its supplies. Trump's tariffs on a wide range of imports have sparked trade tensions with some of its main suppliers like China and Canada. Critical minerals are vital to the production of key technologies ranging from batteries to advanced weapons systems. Trump has also been eager to gain access to Ukraine's critical minerals. He said on Thursday that a deal will be signed ""very shortly"". ""We're also signing agreements in various locations to unlock rare earths and minerals and lots of other things all over the world, but in particular Ukraine"". Aside from Ukraine, the US is negotiating a potential deal with the Democratic Republic of Congo over its mineral resources.  The US President Trump has also talked about taking over the semi-autonomous Danish territory of Greenland, which is rich on rare earths."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvgp5z0rvvjo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"International managers ordinarily have fewer games in which to prove themselves than coaches at club level, but a lack of matches is not a problem Scott Wiseman has to worry about. The 39-year-old has been in charge of the Gibraltar women's team since 2023 and recently oversaw the first competitive international fixtures in their history in the 2024-25 Nations League. Then, earlier this month, former Gibraltar defender was appointed interim manager of the men's side after his long-standing predecessor Julio Cesar Ribas stepped down because of personal reasons. Wiseman - who played for teams including Rochdale, Barnsley, Preston North End and Salford City before ending his career at Gibraltar club Lincoln Red Imps - now has to juggle the demands of the men's World Cup qualifying openers and the women's team's next set of Nations League group fixtures. The men begin their qualifying campaign for next summer's tournament with games against Montenegro and Czech Republic on 22 and 25 March, while the women face Slovakia and Faroe Islands on 4 and 8 April. Far from being overawed, however, the Hull-born coach is relishing the challenge. ""It's fantastic,"" the former right-back, whose 38 appearances for Gibraltar included their first game as a Uefa member, told BBC World Service.  ""It's a privilege to do one [job], let alone be given the opportunity to do two. ""It's no different than a coach who's working day in, day out in England. There are games on a Saturday and Tuesday sometimes, and the preparation for staff and coaches there is very difficult. ""This is no difference in my eyes, except it's two different national teams on different schedules. ""[My wife] was hoping for a bit more 'me time' after I retired. Fortunately, she's very understanding."" Wiseman started his coaching career with Gibraltar's elite development teams while still playing for Lincoln Red Imps and went on to coach the women's Under-19s as well as the men's Under-16, Under-17s and Under-19s. The majority of Wiseman's coaching team with the women's senior side - with whom he says he has a ""good working relationship"" - have joined him in his new role with the men's senior team. Preparations have been further simplified by promising displays by the women in their opening Nations League fixtures against Moldova and Faroe Islands last month. Both games ended in a 1-0 defeat, but Wiseman saw plenty of positives. ""We exceeded expectations massively,"" he addedd.  ""Yes, we lost both games, but the strides the women have made is fantastic. ""We left that on such a high, we have less work to do in our next [games], to a certain degree. We've managed to box a lot of that preparation off."" As for the men, their reward for a second-place finish in League D of the Nations League is a two-legged play-off with Latvia in March next year, the winners of which will be promoted to League C. Wiseman, who was eligible to play for Gibraltar through his mother, says the upcoming World Cup qualifying campaign should be seen as a foundation and ""bounce-board"" for the ties with Latvia. ""The expectation for the next 12 months has to be leading towards the Nations League play-offs,"" he said.  ""We've picked a very young squad - one of the youngest squads I've been a part of. ""We've never had a point in Euro or World Cup qualification, so we could really use this campaign as a foundation for the younger boys coming through and get the international experience we're going to need."" Wiseman is however not certain whether he will still be in charge for that play-off. ""I'm not sure,"" he said when asked about his future.  ""This is something we haven't discussed yet. [Ribas' resignation] was very close to this international window, so we had to be very reactive. ""It was an easy fit for the association. Past these games, we haven't discussed it.""

Indian Police said Darshan Singh and Sunil Devi face charges for causing the death of Harshita Brella by subjecting her to cruelty under what is locally known as the ""dowry death"" law. The investigation is separate to one being led in the UK by Northamptonshire Police, who believe the accused parents' son, Pankaj Lamba, murdered Ms Brella, 24, who lived in Corby, before fleeing the country in November. Mr Lamba, 23, whose whereabouts are unknown, was known to officers before Ms Brella's death and was the subject of a domestic violence protection order. The arrest of Mr Singh and Ms Devi followed a complaint by Ms Brella's parents.  Her father Satbir Singh told the BBC that after months of waiting, he felt some progress was being made in the case. According to the Indian legal code, a dowry death is when ""burns or bodily injury occurs"" to a woman within seven years of marriage. It must also be shown, soon before her death,  that she was ""subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry"". A person who is found guilty of dowry death will be imprisoned for at least seven years, but they could be imprisoned for life. Northamptonshire Police named Mr Lamba as the prime suspect following the discovery of his wife's body in Ilford, London, in November and believed he had fled the UK. It said it had submitted its findings to the Crown Prosecution Service and was waiting for a decision on charges. Ms Brella's family said she and Mr Lamba, 23, had entered into an arranged marriage, with a legal wedding held in August 2023. The couple had their traditional Indian ceremony on 22 March 2024, before they left for the UK around 30 April, settling in Corby."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn52rglxr62o","Subsea fibre cables can 'listen out' for sabotage",2025-03-18,"Chris Baraniuk","Technology Reporter","The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch. He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching. ""He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,"" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. ""The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance."" Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months. So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called ""Baltic Sentry"", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones. The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.  Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.  So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable – by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed. It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year – not a real attempt at sabotage – that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm. The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles. And, the team tested whether their cable could ""hear"" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water. When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself. Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example. AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence. ""You see every single footstep,"" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge. With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times. It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, ""dark"" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds. There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable. AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but ""usually not several kilometres away"". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further. ""People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,"" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems. Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful – one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves. That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset. Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea. Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: ""We do see the number of requests increasing."" Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm. Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening. Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also ""armoury wire"", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. ""On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,"" says Mr Priess. But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says – such is the force of the collision or pulling action.  While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres. ""Cables break all the time,"" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. ""The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,"" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period. Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service. Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: ""It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up."" And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. ""The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,"" Says Benner."

After all, when she bought the property in 2021, she was told by the estate agent that a previous flood the year before, which had reached but not affected the property, was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that flooding measures to protect the properties on the cul-de-sac would be put in place. However, when Storm Babet tore through the UK two years later, Ms Sneddon's home flooded after several days of rain. ""We knew there would be water on the cul-de-sac but no one expected it to flood internally again. However, water entered the property for five hours,"" she says. ""It reached to the top of the skirting boards. We had to have all the flooring, woodwork and lower kitchen replaced, which took nearly 12 months.""  Their final insurance bill was around £45,000.  She says they were fortunate to have qualified for a government scheme providing affordable insurance for homeowners in areas of high-flood risk. Although she loves the area, her neighbours and the house, the weather is now a cause of stress. ""We constantly worry about the weather, if it is going to rain longer than a couple of days, or there is a named storm.  ""We do wish we had taken more steps to understand the risk. The survey showed that the property was in a medium flood zone, but there wasn't much detail other than flood zone maps."" Climate change is increasing the likelihood and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, wildfires and hurricanes. While it might be too late for Ms Sneddon and other homeowners, new tools are being developed to help people and companies assess climate risk.  Last December, the UK Environment Agency updated its National Flood Risk Assessment (NaFRA), showing current and future flood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water for England. It used its own data alongside that of local authorities and climate data from the Met Office. It also brought up to date the National Coastal Erosion Risk Map (NCERM). They were both last updated in 2018 and 2017 respectively. The new NaFRA data shows as many as 6.3 million properties in England are in areas at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea or surface water, and with climate change this could increase to around eight million by 2050. ""We have spent the last few years transforming our understanding of flood and coastal erosion risk in England, drawing on the best available data... as well as improved modelling and technological advances,"" says Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency. ""When we account for the latest climate projections, one in four properties could be in areas at risk of flooding by the middle of the century."" The Environment Agency plans to launch a portal where users can check their long-term flood risk.  Similar resources exist for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales through the ABI. ""We can no longer rely on historical data,"" says Lukky Ahmed, co-founder of Climate X.  The London-based climate risk firm offers a digital twin of the Earth, which simulates different extreme weather events and their potential impact on properties, infrastructure and assets under different emissions scenarios. It combines artificial intelligence with physics-based climate models. ""While many climate models might tell you how much rainfall to expect, they don't say what happens when that water hits the ground,"" he says. ""Our models simulate, for example, what happens when the water hits, where it travels and what the impact of the flooding will be."" While banks and other lenders are testing their product, property companies are currently using their services when considering new developments. ""They log into our platform and identify locations and existing building stock and in return they receive risk rating and severity metrics tied to hazards,"" says Mr Ahmed. Many parts of the world have much more extreme weather than the UK. In the US in January, devastating wild fires tore through parts of Los Angeles. Meanwhile Hurricane Milton, which landed last October, is likely to be one of the costliest hurricanes to hit west Florida. To help insurers manage those costs, New York-based Faura analyses the resilience of homes and commercial buildings. ""We look at the different elements of a property to understand how likely it is to survive and pinpoint resilience and survivability of a property,"" says Faura co-founder Valkyrie Holmes. ""We tell companies and homeowners whether their property will still be standing after a disaster, not just whether a disaster will happen in an area,"" he adds. Faura bases its assessments on satellite and aerial imagery and data from surveys and disaster reports. ""Insurance companies technically have the data to be able to do this but have not build out the models to quantify it,"" says Mr Holmes. Other services are popping up for homebuyers. For the properties it markets, US firm Redfin, estimates the percentage chance of natural disasters, such as flooding and wildfires, occurring up to the next 30 years across each property. ""If people are looking at two homes with the same layout in the same neighbourhood, then climate risk will make or break [their decision],"" says Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather. As for Ms Sneddon, following her personal experience, she now works for flood risk company The FPS Group. ""Flood risk is only going to get worse over the coming years so it is essential to find out as much as you can about the flood risk to a property,"" she advises. ""Flooding has a huge impact on communities and mental health. You are supposed to feel safe in your home, it shouldn't be a place of worry and anxiety."""

Construction of a new facility to test and build ""trackless trams"" is set to begin in July at Teesside Airport. It is hoped the vehicles will be used to move luggage from aircraft to baggage handling facilities and as passenger shuttles. Tees Valley Combined Authority's (TVCA) Andrea Reacroft said the vehicles would be rolled out in a ""phased approach"" and, if successful, they could be used in town centres in Teesside by the end of 2027. Ms Reacroft, TVCA's digital transport programme delivery manager, said the phased roll-out would allow testing to be carried out in a ""controlled environment before wider deployment"". She said revised legislation was expected to come into force in 2027 which would allow CAM (Connected and Automated Mobility) technology to operate on roads without a safety driver. Before then, a licence is needed for trials to take place at Teesworks, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The facility at Teesside Airport will be one of eight government-funded CAM testbeds in the UK. A feasibility study into the tram project is nearing completion and, if approved, this will be followed by a six-month procurement period. Testing on the vehicles will then start at the end of 2025 or beginning of 2026. A second pilot phase will then be carried out at the airport in the third quarter of 2026. At a meeting of TVCA's transport committee, concerns were raised about whether the driverless vehicles would affect jobs. Head of transport Alan Weston said although the trams would not need a driver, staff would be needed to service the vehicles and to work in the control room.

SJE Arts has become known for its International Piano Series, which had previously been held at St Stephen's House's main chapel - St John the Evangelist Church. The auditorium at St John's College in the city will now host the concerts, which are due to take place this autumn. The college said the move to the ""intimate and acoustically rich setting"" would ""enhance"" the series' ""reach and impact"" while ""maintaining its tradition of excellence"". Michèle Smith, SJE Arts director, said: ""We are really looking forward to moving to the delightful auditorium at St John's, with its lovely Steinway D piano, and are already making plans about whom to invite for the first St John's series."" This year marks the 12th edition of the series, which Ms Smith said was ""very popular"" and had a ""strong and enthusiastic following"". She previously told the BBC the news that St Stephen's could no longer resource concerts in its chapel was a ""really sad loss"". In a statement, the theological college said it could no longer resource the event ""in a way that is within both our means and our charitable ends"". The concerts will now relocate to St John's College, which was founded in 1555 and is one of Oxford's largest. Prof Jason Stanyek, performing art fellow at St John's, said the college was ""thrilled"" to host the concerts.  He said the announcement ""strengthens our vision of making the college a leading centre for exceptional musical experiences"". ""The presence of internationally renowned pianists will undoubtedly inspire both students and audiences alike,"" he added.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly41yx9w88o","The slow but steady advance of driverless vehicles",2025-03-21,"Ian Rose","Business reporter","Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral. To get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on. But he got much more attention than he bargained for.  Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on. The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch. Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers. ""Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?"" Mr Johns filmed himself asking. Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control. Waymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem. The company says its driverless system is ""better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports"". Nevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action. Last year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole. And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles . The road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services. In December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise. GM attributed the change of strategy to ""the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business"". In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured. Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding. Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020.  But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla. Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida. So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed? ""Three things - people, money and process,"" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy. He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach. ""They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe."" So what's next? Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey. That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans. ""Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,"" Mr Kampshoff says. He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing. ""Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,"" he says.  It will be a slow process.  ""It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,"" says Mr Beiker.  ""You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,"" he adds.  And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.  ""This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,"" says Mr Kampshoff. For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry. ""Safety is the number one concern that we work on,"" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania. ""Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,"" says Mr Liu. ""Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,"" Mr Liu explains. ""A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed. ""So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance."" To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China.  In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu. Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers. ""There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,"" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova. Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles. ""One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem."""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz61vwjel2zo","Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk",2025-03-20,"Theo Leggett","International Business Correspondent","Listen to Theo read this article ""This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream,"" says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y. Ben is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go – because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees. ""I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,"" he says. ""There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement."" Ben is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending. Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer. For some who do not share his views, it has all become too much.  There have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal.  Although most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire. In the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps. US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as ""domestic terrorism"". Musk has also been unequivocal in his response. ""This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,"" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. ""Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks."" What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.  And if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm? Two decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical. Musk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence. ""Tesla was the pioneer,"" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. ""They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness."" It is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth. Nowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless ""robotaxis"". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus. Like the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts. But recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges. Although its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million. The decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down. This year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February – although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% – as well as in Australia.  Meanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month. In early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day – adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year. Sales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y – with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada – although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets. In the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: ""Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago."" Tesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales. But experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO. To start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market. ""If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,"" says Ms Valdez Streaty. ""They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there."" Prof Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: ""We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem."" Competition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars. At the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology. ""China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,"" says Ms Valdez Streaty. ""You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well."" The extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes – significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network. Musk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles. In January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time. In 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's ""Full Self Driving"" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a ""hands-on"" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times. ""Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,"" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy. Arguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket. Asked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded ""with great difficulty"". ""It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,"" says Prof Wells. ""If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly."" Ever since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake – currently worth more than $95bn. That is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes. For those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation. Today, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings – a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth. ""Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles – which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers – or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,"" says Mr Nagley. None of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment –  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down. But analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. ""A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,"" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research. ""It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand."" ""I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment."" says Prof Wells. ""I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business. ""It needs a significant change of direction now.""

"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250319-the-un-declared-2025-as-the-year-of-glacier-preservation-visit-one-safely","The UN has declared 2025 as the year of glacier preservation. Here's how to visit one safely",2025-03-21,"Anna Fiorentino","","With glaciers disappearing at an alarming rate, 2025 has been named the Year of International Glacier Preservation. Here's how and where to see one responsibly before it's too late. On an exceptionally warm July day in 2022, certified mountain guide Andrea Milani took a lunch break from rock climbing near the Italian Dolomites' Passo Fedaia ascent. As he ate pizza with two friends, helicopters circled and ambulance sirens wailed in the distance. A massive chunk (80m wide and 25m high) had just broken off nearby Marmolada glacier, triggering an avalanche of ice, snow and debris. Milani's two friends who'd finished that descent just hours before meeting him were the lucky ones: 11 climbers tragically died that day. ""Now more than ever, climate change is making glacier travel more dangerous. Rising temperatures mean the snow covering crevasses and seracs becomes less reliable, increasing the risk of hidden hazards,"" says Milani, who guides climbers, skiers, bikers and hikers of all levels safely across Northern Italy with Dolomite Mountains tours.  The reality is that one-third of glaciers could disappear from climate change by 2050 – and for Marmolada, it's 2040. This is why the United Nations has declared 2025 the International Year of Glaciers' Preservation. It has also set 21 March 2025 as the first annual World Day for Glaciers in partnership with Unesco and the World Meteorological Organization. The initiatives aim to mobilise governments and organisations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implement climate adaptation strategies to protect the planet's 200,000 glaciers as the Earth warms faster than ever before.   ""Worldwide, human-caused climate change has melted so much ice from glaciers that the meltwater has raised global sea level 8cm since 1900,"" says Patrick Gonzalez, former principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service and assistant director for climate and biodiversity of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Sadly, scenes like the one at Marmolada have played out across the planet time and again. Over the past two decades, Bolivia's 18,000-year-old Chacaltaya glacier, once the world's highest ski resort, has melted completely. Italy and Switzerland were forced to redraw their shared borders last autumn due to the melt of the Matterhorn in Zermatt. And at Muir Glacier in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park, climate change has melted away a layer of ice as tall as New York's One World Trade Center. These slow-moving, fast-retreating dense masses of ice, snow and rock that have accumulated in the mountains over centuries on every continent except Australia are glaring evidence that man-made climate change exists. If all glaciers were to melt today, sea level would increase by a half a metre, leaving entire cities underwater, devastating ecosystems and depriving two billion people of drinking water. But travellers can still visit glaciers like Marmolada safely – they just need to know how. In fact, research has shown that seeing a glacier in nature can prompt us to protect the planet. Glaciers are now a symbol of its fragility, reminding us how, through simple cost-effective solutions like walking, biking and purchasing solar and wind energy, we can help limit global warming. While 91% of glaciers are in Antarctica, many can be found in more accessible parts of the world, so go visit one; it's easier than ever, just make sure you proceed with caution. Mountaineers, skiers and nature lovers from all over the world flock to the Canadian Rockies for irresistible high alpine terrain, and that includes the Columbia Icefields. Straddling the majestic Banff and Jasper national parks on the Continental Divide, it's all that's left of an ice mass that once enveloped most of western Canada's mountains. Ride the Ice Explorer to the Athabasca Glacier to walk the glass-floored Columbia Icefield Skywalk with sweeping views over the waterfalls coming from the Sunwapta Valley's glacier and the famous mountain goats of Glacier Lookout along the cliffs. If you are bold enough to climb the glacier, go with an experienced Yamnuska Mountain Adventures guide. You'll learn about glacier dynamics, route finding and risk management on one of the largest icefields in North America. It's an adventure that demands respect and preparation, says Yamnuska mountain guide Jesse de Montigny. ""The primary danger is crevasses – deep, often hidden cracks in the ice that can be difficult to detect, especially when covered by snow,"" says de Montigny. ""Weather conditions can change rapidly, creating whiteout conditions that make navigation difficult. Proper rope systems, glacier travel techniques and crevasse rescue knowledge are essential for mitigating risk in these environments."" Mendenhall is one of more than 100,000 glaciers in what's appropriately called the ""Glacier State"". Inside the Tongass National Forest, 19km from Juneau along the Alaska-Canada border in south-eastern Alaska, is the Juneau Icefield. It's also one of Alaska's only glaciers that can be reached for viewing by car or shuttle; start your adventure at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center. More like this: • Visiting Antarctica or the Arctic? Here's how to minimise your impact • Why humans are drawn to the ends of the Earth • Antarctic tourism: Should we just say no? Since it has been melting excessively in recent years, rather than joining a helicopter tour (a major source of carbon emissions), get a good look at the face of glacier on a kayak tour with Mendenhall Lake Kayaking Adventure. (The glacier's ice caves are no longer safely accessible.) Note: As of 13 March, the majority of the glacier's Forest Service park rangers and staff were laid off due to federal cuts, despite the tourist season commencing in April. Meanwhile the Juneau Icefield is melting five times faster than it was in the 1980s. It's worth overcoming your fear of heights for the ""Queen of the Dolomites"", located within Northern Italy's 12 interconnected Dolomiti Superski resorts. Take the cable car up, and whether you ride back down or ski the glacier, make a stop at Europe's highest museum to learn about World War One tunnels dug by Austro-Hungarian soldiers who lived there for months in their glacier ""Ice City"". If you decide to brave mountaineering or climbing, be sure to hire a guide. Miliani always tells his Dolomite Mountains tour groups to stay aware and read the environment. ""Glacier mountaineering isn't just about skill; it's about preparation, experience and respect for the environment, he says. His advice? Distance yourself from the next climber (by 8-12m) moving along the rope at a steady pace and avoid sudden movements that could throw off your balance. Check the map and the weather (the colder the better), and most importantly, the avalanche forecast. Wear the right gear, pack a self-rescue kit, GPS, compass, altimeter and radio or satellite phone. And don't leave home without taking a first-aid course.  ""Crevasses can be sneaky, hiding under thin layers of snow, so knowing how to spot and test them is crucial,"" he adds. ""If you're crossing a snow bridge [an arc formed by snow across a crevasse] make sure it's stable before stepping onto it. And let's not forget seracs and avalanche zones – don't hang around under them longer than necessary."" It's just got easier to visit Chamonix's Mer de Glace (also known as Montenvers), only second in size in the Alps to Switzerland's Aletsch Glacier. This iridescent ice aqua glacier – transmitting a blue wavelength and absorbing all the other colours – has become harder to view after losing 6m of thickness a year. Since last year, though, visitors' can now see Mer de Glace via a new gondola from a 1,913m-high panoramic platform. There's an on-site restaurant, coffee shop, museum and even an ice cave that visitors can still walk through – originally cut into the glacier in 1992 by high mountain guides and now re-dug every summer because, like icebergs, glaciers are always moving, more than ever now. Access the gondola by taking the train up the mountain from Chamonix town centre. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."

The sport was not part of the programme for the next Olympics when the schedule was first announced in 2022. But the IOC granted provisional recognition for World Boxing as the sport's global body last month before voting for its inclusion at the ongoing session in Greece. ""I thank you for the approval of having boxing back. We can look forward to a great boxing tournament,"" outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach said. Boxing has featured at every Olympics since 1904, except 1912, but the IOC has run the sport at the past two Games after the International Boxing Association (IBA) was suspended in 2019 over governance, finance, refereeing and ethical issues. The Russian-led IBA was then stripped of its status in June 2023 over a failure to implement reforms. The IOC and the IBA clashed during last year's Olympics in Paris over the participation of two boxers, Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting. The IBA banned the fighters during the 2023 World Championships saying they had failed gender eligibility tests, but the IOC allowed them to compete and both won gold medals in their weight classes. World Boxing was formed in April 2023 and now has 84 members across five continents, including Great Britain.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1zv5d54ko","How did Nasa's Suni and Butch fill nine months in space?",2025-03-18,"Tim Dodd","Climate and science reporter","Voting, enjoying Christmas dinner and keeping fit in zero gravity - that's just some of what has kept Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams busy during their prolonged stay on the International Space Station (ISS). After nine months, the pair are finally making their way home in a SpaceX Dragon capsule. So what has life been like for the Nasa astronauts orbiting 250 miles (400km) above us, and how have they passed the time? Of course there was a lot of serious space stuff to keep them occupied.  Suni, 59, and Butch, 62, have been helping ongoing missions at the station with maintenance and experiments, and have conducted spacewalks. Suni ventured outside in mid-January with fellow astronaut Nick Hague to perform repairs on the craft. She and Butch went out together later in the month.  Their tasks included repairing equipment that governs station orientation, adding light filters on the NICER X-ray telescope, and replacing a reflector device on an international docking adapter. Butch and Suni have taken the situation in their stride, saying in a news conference in September that they have been trained to ""expect the unexpected"". They have definitely had opportunities for reflection about life back home - and for watching a lot of sunrises and sunsets. As the space station makes 16 orbits of Earth every 24 hours, it travels through 16 sunrises and sunsets, treating those on board to a sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes. Living with such a unique view of the Earth gives plenty of room for contemplating it, something Suni has acknowledged. ""It opens up the door to making you think a bit differently. It's the one planet we have and we should be taking care of it,"" she said. ""There are so many people on Earth sending us messages it makes you feel right at home with everybody."" Butch and Suni and the two other Americans who were on board with them, Don Pettit and Nick Hague, each had the opportunity to vote in last year's US election.  ""It's a very important duty that we have as citizens,"" Suni said to reporters. Butch said Nasa had made it ""very easy"" for them to be included in elections. To facilitate their voting, the Mission Control Center in Houston sent ballot papers via encrypted email to the ISS. The astronauts then filled them out and transmitted them to satellites which relayed them to a ground terminal in New Mexico. From there, landlines transmitted the ballots to Mission Control, who then electronically sent them to the astronauts' county clerks for filing. For Butch, the day starts at 04:30, and as for Suni, she makes a slightly kinder 06:30 start. Both have said they enjoy the two hours or more of exercise they must do daily to combat the loss of bone density from living in space. ""Your joints don't hurt, which is quite nice,"" Butch has said. Three different machines help to counter the effect of living in zero gravity. The Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) is used for squats, deadlifts, and rows that work all the muscle groups. For treadmills crews must strap in to stop themselves floating away, and there is also a cycle ergometer for endurance training. At Christmas, astronauts on the International Space Station posted a festive message in which they wished their friends and family on Earth a merry Christmas. The team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers, throwing the slowly gyrating microphone to each other to speak while candy canes floated around their heads. It was a chance for the crew to let their hair down, though in Suni's case it was more a case of letting it 'up'. Zero gravity has given her a style that would take a lot of product to achieve on Earth. One of Butch and Suni's final duties on board the ISS was to make their replacements feel welcome. On 16 March a SpaceX capsule carrying a new crew arrived at the ISS. It was a deeply significant event for Butch and Suni, as it paved the way for them to come home. Butch rang a ceremonial bell as Suni handed over command to cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin. On Tuesday, they finally undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT)."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce8mjd4dp6zo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Louis Buffon, son of Italian World Cup winner Gianluigi, says his international future is with the Czech Republic rather than his father's country. The 17-year-old Pisa winger has been called up by the Czech Under-18s side for games against England, France and Portugal. Buffon qualifies for the Czech national team through his mother, model Alena Seredova. And the teenager, who made his professional debut for Pisa in the Italian second division earlier this month, says he will stay loyal to his mother's birth country. ""I talked to the family and we decided that playing for the Czech Republic would be best for my football career and my development,"" Buffon said in an interview for the Czech Football Association (FACR). It means he will not follow in the footsteps of his father Gianluigi, who was part of the Italy side that won the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Buffon Sr played a major part in that success as part of a stellar 28-year professional career which saw him win 176 senior international caps, 10 Serie A titles with Juventus, as well as Ligue 1 with Paris St-Germain and the 1999 Uefa Cup at Parma. But his son added: ""My mum was naturally very happy but my dad was excited too because it was my first national team call-up. He also advised me to play for the Czech Republic, because it's the best way I can evolve as a player."" Louis was first called up by the Czech Under-18s for a training camp in February, sparking worldwide media interest. ""Honestly, I didn't expect that, but I have grown up under a microscope with my parents since I was a child and I hope they have taught me what to do and say,"" he said. Louis would also not have a problem if he eventually played against Italy as he added: ""I was born and grew up in Italy, but I think that to be a 100% professional and do my job as best I can, I have to see each game as important, whether against Italy or another national team."""

The Real Madrid player, 32, is back in his country's squad for the first time since falling out with former Belgium manager Domenico Tedesco in June 2023, leading to him leaving a Euro 2024 qualifying training camp. Belgium were beaten by France in the last 16 of last summer's European Championship, with Al-Qadsiah goalkeeper Koen Casteels starting all four of their games in Germany. With Rudi Garcia now in charge of the national team, Courtois looks set to play in the upcoming Nations League play-off against Ukraine. On Tuesday, Courtois accepted he could have handled his fall-out with Tedesco better, and has taken time to explain matters to his fellow Belgium players. ""There were a lot of misunderstandings, half-truths, so I was able to explain what happened,"" he said. ""The team-mates were able to ask their questions. ""I'm relieved that we were able to talk everything out. Everything is clear and now we're looking ahead. I know I made my mistakes. At that time, I wasn't mentally 100% ready to play. ""After a long season, you sometimes have impulsive reactions and that was not smart of me - that was not the best thing for the team and the supporters. ""I still think the [Belgian] Football Association could have handled it better afterwards, but I also suffered a serious knee injury. I wasn't ready to play at the European Championship anyway. And when a relationship with a coach breaks down it's also difficult."" Reports at the time, external suggested Courtois left the training camp in 2023 after being overlooked for the captaincy in what would have been his first home game since winning his 100th cap. He added: ""A lot had been written that I left because I didn't get the captain's armband, but that's not true. That's the biggest disinformation. ""I understand it was hard for the fans at the time. I hope that they can accept me again.  ""I understand it's not easy, but I hope that they will support the team."" Belgium and Aston Villa midfielder Youri Tielemans said it was important Courtois explained matters. ""The most important thing is that he realises that some things went down badly with the group of players, but he said that he had not meant it that way,"" he said."

Robertson's fourth international goal came in stoppage-time against Poland in November, earning a 2-1 victory in Warsaw to clinch third place in Nations League Group A1. Now Scotland must prevail against Greece to remain in the tournament's top tier. According to the captain, the team made ""huge strides"" in their debut Group A campaign, amassing seven points from the final three games after losing the first three. ""The Nations League has been important for us and the aim was always to get to Group A,"" said Robertson. ""We then saw the rewards when we held our own against Portugal and Croatia. ""There was a lot of negativity after the Euros and rightly so. We believed we could get out of the group and we didn't perform to the levels we know we can.  ""There was a lot of talk around 'is this the end for this squad?' But I think we have bounced back really well.""

Belarus and the defeated side in the Nations League quarter-final between Portugal and Denmark are the other opponents, with matches beginning in September and concluding in November. Scotland have not been at the World Cup since 1998, when Robertson was aged four. He said: ""You look at the group and think 'can we compete?' Yes, that's a definite, but it's going to be tough. ""Hopefully, we have everyone fit and we can give it a right good shot. Playing at a World Cup would be the ultimate.""

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/64584534",NA,NA,NA,NA,"When Finn Russell and Gareth Anscombe commence an inevitable kicking duel during Saturday's game, spectators would do well to remember how far the game has come. It is more than 60 years since a game that holds a firm place in rugby infamy. The Murrayfield slugfest in 1963 is regarded as one of the dreariest matches ever played - and it changed the way the game was played forever. And one man was responsible for the 'spectacle' - Clive Rowlands. The Big Freeze of 1963 was among the harshest winters on record. Sporting fixtures across the country were cancelled, however the newly installed undersoil heating at Murrayfield and an army of volunteers with snow shovels ensured the February game between Scotland and Wales went ahead. However, many of the 60,000 who braved the bitter cold may have wished they had not. Wales won 6-0. Although at the time such a scoreline was commonplace, the aspect that had purists crying into their beer were the tactics employed that day by the visitors - tactics that yielded an astonishing 111 line-outs. The average for international rugby today is rarely more than 20. As Denis Busher of the Daily Herald wrote at the time: ""International rugby is in its death throes as a spectator sport. Wales won carrying 'modern' power rugby to its logical conclusion."" How rugby beat the 1963 Big Freeze, external Five things we learned from Slammed: The Seventies Rugby's 'greatest try' as you've never seen before Wales' recent head coach Warren Gatland was familiar with the critique, but 62 years ago it was the wily Rowlands who opted for brawn over brains. The Wales scrum-half and captain spotted an opportunity with some bedtime reading the night before the match. According to the matchday programme, the rival sets of forwards were evenly matched in terms of size. Rowlands, however, suspected differently.  After checking with a few of his forwards, who admitted to being a few pounds heavier than the official records, and given the conditions, Rowlands decided Wales would try to beat Scotland at their own game up front. At a time when there was no penalty for kicking the ball straight into touch, even outside the 25-yard line - now the 22m line - Rowlands set about hoofing the ball up field time, and time... and time again. The power of the Wales pack and the unrelenting barrage of kicks pinned Scotland back for all but the final moments of a game that also included more than 35 scrums. The Wales backs may have boasted speed and guile, but were reduced to spectators. It is said their supremely gifted outside-half David Watkins received just two passes from Rowlands all game. Quiz: Can you name Wales' Murrayfield try-scorers? Wales centre Brian Davies, who was dropped for the next match, said: ""I touched the ball twice and could hardly feel my hands in the cold."" Wales won at Murrayfield for the first time in 10 years, thanks to a penalty from full-back Grahame Hodgson and a stunning drop goal from Rowlands - the only international points he scored. Rowlands was carried from the pitch on the shoulders of travelling fans and was unrepentant about his tactics. ""It was not attractive and I felt sorry for the backs,"" he said after the match. ""But we were all out to win and we played to win. The pack did a great job. ""I was never at any time tempted to open the game up and let my backs make the running. That's what Scotland were praying we'd do."" Supporters may have been jubilant, but there were serious misgivings over where the game was heading. In the Daily Express, Pat Marshall concluded: ""This was power-rugby, brutally bludgeoned up and down the touchlines by two brutish packs with kicking scrum-halves yapping at their heels.  ""It has no part in the pattern of British rugby, where quickness of wit and fleetness of foot still counts for more than brawn supported by an educated boot. Rowlands won a tactical victory, but it was no victory for rugby."" Others followed suit and steadily the authorities were moved to adopt the 'Australian dispensation' and ban direct kicking to touch from outside the 25-yard line some years later. The irony is that the team that benefitted the most from the law changes was the great Wales team of the early 1970s - coached of course by Rowlands.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4k0d55q24o","Astronauts Butch and Suni begin journey home after nine months in space",2025-03-18,"Rebecca Morelle","Science Editor•@BBCMorelle","After an epic nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally on their way home. Their stay on the International Space Station (ISS) was only supposed to last eight days, but their mission was dramatically extended after the spacecraft that they arrived on suffered technical problems. The pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. They undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) . Their landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough. It will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy. The SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C. As it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity. Finally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean. Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it. ""They're experienced astronauts but they will feel fantastic to be back on Earth. The fresh air is the first thing that gets you,"" she told BBC News. The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024. They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing. But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home. Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return. So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September. It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now. The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return – and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end. The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space. They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station. And despite the astronauts being described as ""stranded"" they never really were. Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency. Speaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended. ""We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,"" he said. Suni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission. ""I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,"" she said. ""I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow."" The pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner. But Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs. Garrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission. ""It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,"" he told BBC News. ""And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars…. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'."" Once the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts. Long duration missions in space take a toll on the body, as astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight. It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets. Garrett Reisman has been in touch with his friend Suni while she's been in space. ""I had an email from Suni just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs, and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face,"" he told the BBC. ""It's the basic things about life here on Earth that you miss."""
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2kg804dxlpo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Former Northern Ireland captain Marissa Callaghan has announced her retirement from international football. Callaghan, 39, won 91 caps and led Northern Ireland to the Euro 2022 finals - the country's first women's major tournament. The Cliftonville midfielder has not featured for Northern Ireland after being left out of Tanya Oxtoby's squad for October's Euro 2025 play-off with Croatia. Callaghan's final cap came against Malta in April, a month before she relinquished the Northern Ireland captaincy. She made her debut in 2010 against Scotland and wore the armband for the first of 52 occasions against Georgia in 2016 - a game in which she scored two of her eight international goals. ""Putting on the green jersey is a feeling that you cannot explain, and it doesn't matter whether it's a friendly game, a game at the Euros or a competitive game,"" Callaghan told the Irish FA. ""When you walk out onto that pitch and cross that white line, it's just the feeling of immense pride. It's an incredible feeling and I'm so thankful that I got to do that 91 times."" Callaghan works as a women's and girls' football administrator with the Irish FA Foundation and helped Cliftonville to an unbeaten league campaign in 2024 as the Reds won the treble. She is set to continue playing for Cliftonville as they compete in the Champions League. Callaghan will also be a pundit for BBC Sport NI's coverage of the upcoming men's fixtures with Switzerland and Sweden. Marissa Callaghan will go down as one of Northern Ireland's greatest captains and players.  Her announcement comes as little surprise given she had fallen out of favour under current manager Oxtoby in the autumn and her last cap came almost a year ago. But it is only right that Callaghan should have the say on closing this chapter of her career. Qualifying for Euro 2022 was the undoubted highlight as Callaghan and Northern Ireland made history - and the midfielder even had to overcome an injury scare to feature in Southampton. Fittingly, it was Callaghan who netted the crucial goal in Belfast in the play-off against Ukraine that set Northern Ireland on their way to the finals and her influence was integral as a young squad defied the odds. She also led Northern Ireland out at Wembley to face England, which was another symbolic moment to show the progress that had been made in women's football in the country. Callaghan has been the face of women's football in Northern Ireland, and importantly, her contribution to football in Northern Ireland is not over yet and her impact in the sport will continue through her roles at the Irish FA and Cliftonville."

The 26-year-old earned two England caps during the Six Nations in February 2023 when he was a London Irish player. He moved to Tigers that following summer and it is in his second season with the East Midlands club that he earned an international recall, having featured for England A last month. He scored a try in the second-string national team's win against Ireland A, external in Bristol, adding to the 12 tries he has scored for Tigers across all competitions so far this season. ""My whole career has been me being a late bloomer, in terms of my maturity,"" Hassell-Collins told BBC Radio Leicester. ""I think, this season especially, I have just matured loads and I'm reading the game better."" Only Bristol Bears' Fiji international Kalaveti Ravouvou - with eight tries - has touched down more times than Hassell-Collins (seven) in the Premiership so far this season. While his haul of 12 tries across all competitions is the best Hassell-Collins has managed in any single campaign to date, he is yet to match the 10 league tries he grabbed in back-to-back campaigns with Irish that earned him his first England caps. ""I'm scoring tries, which is helping my confidence,"" he said. ""It's my job, and I'm doing my job and making line breaks and I feel like I've been defending well. ""It's all come together a bit."" And it is with that new-found belief that Hassell-Collins wants to step back on to the full international stage. ""If I was to go back in, then I think I'd be mature enough to go straight back in and adapt to what they are doing and show what I can do and get on the ball,"" he said. ""Last time I was probably a bit hesitant, and probably wasn't putting myself in the best light in terms of what I could do on the ball. ""If I got another opportunity, I'd be mature and confident enough to go in there and grab it with two hands."""

"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230927-what-a-long-term-mission-in-space-does-to-the-human-body","What does spending a long time in space do to the human body?",2025-03-18,"Richard Gray","@chalkmark","The record for a single trip into space currently stands at 437 days, but prolonged periods in orbit can alter an astronaut's body in some surprising ways, changing their muscles, brains and even their gut bacteria. Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore never expected to stay in orbit for nine months. Their initial trip to the International Space Station onboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was scheduled to last just eight days in June 2024. But after technical problems with the spacecraft meant it had to return to Earth without them, their stay in space has been longer than expected. Now they are finally making a return to Earth, the pair will have to acclimatise to the full tug of our planet's gravity on their bodies after so long away from home. Of course, neither are new to the rigours of space travel. They are both experienced astronauts. But any extended time in the strange, low gravity environment of space is likely to have affected their bodies. To understand how, we need to look at those who have stays in space have been longer.  The longest single spaceflight by an American to date was by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio after he spent 371 days living aboard the American-football-field-sized collection of modules and solar panels that make up the ISS. His time in orbit – which surpassed the previous US record of 355 consecutive days – was extended in March 2023 after the spacecraft he and his crewmates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak. He eventually came home in October 2023. The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km). Even so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human – Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s. And in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts – Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub – broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. The pair departed the ISS in the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft along with US astronaut Tracy Dyson, who had spent six months onboard. With a huge grin on his face, Kononenko gave a double thumbs up as he was helped from the re-entry capsule after it bumped back to Earth in a cloud of dust near the remote town of Dzhezkazgan on the Kazakhstan Steppe. He now also holds the record for the longest cumulative time in space – a total of 1,111 days in orbit. Kononenko and Chub travelled more than 158 million miles during their 5,984 orbits of the Earth in the latest mission to the ISS. But spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies, so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams. Rubio's own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long-duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present. He is the first astronaut to participate in a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body. While the results have yet to be published, it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to explore deeper into the Solar System. A return journey to Mars, for example, is expected to take around 1,100 days (just over three years) under current plans. The spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS, meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed. But problems keeping fit aside, just what does spaceflight do to the human body? Muscles and bones Without the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those muscles that help to maintain our posture in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps – in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks muscle mass can fall by as much as 20% and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%. Similarly, because astronauts are not putting their skeletons through as much mechanical strain as they do when subject to Earth's gravity, their bones also start to demineralise and lose strength. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of their bone mass every month they spend in space and up to 10% over a six-month period (on Earth, older men and women lose bone mass at a rate of 0.5%-1% every year). This can increase their risk of suffering fractures and increase the amount of time it takes to heal. It can take up to four years for their bone mass to return to normal after returning to Earth. To combat this, astronauts undertake 2.5 hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS. This includes a series of squats, deadlifts, rows and bench presses using a resistive exercise device installed in the ISS's ""gym"", alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike. They also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible. A recent study, however, highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size. It recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss. The lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly. This can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on Earth. During a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to Earth, Rubio himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening. ""I think my spine has extended just enough that I'm kind of wedged into my seat liner, so I shouldn't move much at all,"" he said. Weight loss Although weight means very little while in orbit – the microgravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely, including human bodies – maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit. Although Nasa tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods, including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station, it can still affect an astronaut's body. Scott Kelly, a Nasa astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long-term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for 340 days while his twin brother stayed back on Earth, lost 7% of his body mass while in orbit. Eyesight On Earth, gravity helps to force the blood in our bodies downward while the heart pumps it up again. In space, however, this process becomes messed up (although the body does adapt somewhat), and blood can accumulate in the head more than it normally would. Some of this fluid can pool at the back of the eye and around the optic nerve, leading to oedema. This can lead to changes in vision such as decreased sharpness and structural changes in the eye itself. These changes can start to occur after just two weeks in space but as that time goes on, the risk increases. Some of the vision changes reverse within about a year of astronauts returning to Earth, but others can be permanent. Exposure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems. The Earth's atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS, this protection disappears. While spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation, astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves. Neural shuffling After his long stay on the ISS, however, Kelly's cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother's on the ground. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home. A study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit. It found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function – in other words, movement – and also in the vestibular cortex, which plays an important role in orientation, balance and perception of our own motion. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down. A more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. Cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles (responsible for storing cerebrospinal fluid, providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste) can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size. Friendly bacteria It is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorgansims that live in and on our bodies. This microbiota can influence how we digest food, affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work. Researchers examining Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the very different food he was eating and the change in the people he spent his days with (we obtain a horrifying amount of gut and oral microorganisms from the people we live alongside). But exposure to radiation and the use of recycled water, along with changes to his physical activity could all also have played a role. (Find out more about how exercise affects your gut microbes.) Skin Although there have now been five Nasa astronauts who have spent more than 300 days in orbit, we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit. His skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station. Researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint. Genes  One of the most significant findings from Kelly's prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA. At the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as telomeres, which are thought to help protect our genes from damage. As we age, these get shorter, but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these telomeres. ""Most striking, however, was the finding of significantly longer telomeres during spaceflight,"" says Susan Bailey, a professor of environmental and radiological health at Colorado State University who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother. She has done separate studies with another 10 unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months. ""Also unexpected was that telomere length shortened rapidly on return to Earth for all crewmembers. Of particular relevance to long-term health and ageing trajectories, astronauts in general had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they did before."" Exactly why this happens is still being unravelled, she says. ""We have some clues, but additional long-duration crewmembers – like Rubio, who spent one year in space – will be critical to really characterising and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes."" One possible cause could be exposure to the complex mix of radiation while in space. Astronauts who experience long-term exposure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage, she says. There were also some changes in gene expression – the mechanism that reads the DNA to produce proteins in cells – seen in Kelly that may have been related to his journey into space. Some of these related to the body's response to DNA damage, bone formation and the immune system's response to stress. Most of these changes, however, had returned to normal within six months of his return to Earth. In June 2024, a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight. Using gene expression data from samples obtained from the crew of the SpaceX Inspiration 4 mission, who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of 2021, it identified changes in 18 proteins related to the immune system, ageing and muscle growth. Comparing their gene activity to those of 64 other astronauts on previous missions, the study found in the expression of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight. The men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight, with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to Earth. In particular, the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin-6, which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body, and interleukin-8, which is produced to gulde immune cells to sites of infection, were more affected in the men compared to the women. Another protein, called firbrinogen, which is involved in blood clotting, was also affected more in male astronauts. But the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight, but it could be related to their response to stress. You can hear Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below. With an accumulated 675 days in space, she has spent more time in orbit than any other American, although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has clocked up 878 days in space. Immune system  Kelly received a series of vaccines before, during and after his trip into space and his immune system was found to react normally. But Bailey's research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit. There are still many questions to be answered, however, about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal, big-brained species that evolved to live on Earth. As researchers pour over Rubio's medical tests, blood samples and scans following his 371 days in space, they will doubtless be hoping they will learn more. * This article was originally published on 27 September 2023.

The UK exports hundreds of millions of pounds worth of steel to the US every year, which will be subject to the 25% levy. The EU, facing the same tariffs, said on Wednesday it would impose counter-tariffs on €26bn (£22bn) of US goods, and Canada also responded with countermeasures, in an escalation of the wider trade war. Sir Keir said the UK was taking a ""pragmatic"" approach and was pushing for a trade deal, but opposition politicians called for a more ""robust"" response. When Sir Keir visited the White House last month, trade was high on the agenda, with the PM seeking a trade deal and exemptions to Trump's tariffs. Asked at the time if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said ""he tried"", adding: ""He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there."" It is understood tariffs were also discussed during a phone call between Sir Keir and Trump on Monday. However, as the latest tariffs came into effect, there were no exemptions for any country. European Union (EU) President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU's retaliatory tariffs were ""strong but proportionate"" and that the EU remains ""open to negotiations"". The EU tariffs will be imposed on ""products ranging from boats to bourbon to motorbikes,"" the EU said. They will be partially introduced on 1 April and fully in place on 13 April. Canada will impose C$29.8bn (£16bn) of retaliatory tariffs on US exports from Thursday, Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said. Alongside steel and aluminium, the levies will apply to computers, sports equipment, and cast iron products, LeBlanc said. Later on Wednesday Trump said he would ""of course"" respond to the retaliation, repeating his warning that he planned to impose ""reciprocal"" tariffs on countries around the world. ""Whatever it is, doesn't matter what it is, if they charge us, if they charge us 25% or 20% or 10% or 2% or 200% then that's what we're charging them,"" he said.  The US President said he was ""not happy"" with EU trade policies, citing concerns about legal penalties it has imposed on Apple and rules he claimed put US farm products and cars at a disadvantage. ""They're doing what they should be doing perhaps for the European Union but it does create ill will,"" he said.  Repeating his threat to hit European cars with tariffs, he added later: ""We're going to win that financial battle."" Tariffs could lead to US companies buying less from overseas. A knock-on effect could be more cheap steel flooding other markets, including the UK, as trade is redirected, putting additional pressure on domestic producers. Gareth Stace, director general at industry body UK Steel, said the US move was ""hugely disappointing"". Some steel company contracts have already been cancelled or been put on hold, he said. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham called on the government to ""act decisively"" to protect the steel industry. The Community union called for a UK tax on carbon-intensive steel, produced with a bigger environmental footprint, which would include exports from China and India. The UK exports a relatively small amount of steel and aluminium to the US, around £700m in total. However the tariffs also cover products made with steel and aluminium, worth much more, about £2.2bn, or about 5% of UK exports to the US last year. Sir Keir's comments at Prime Minister's Questions came in response to Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who called for the UK to be ""more robust"" with the US president ""like the Europeans and like the Canadians"". Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said Labour ""can't even get themselves in the room"" to negotiate with the US"". Sir Keir said: ""We are... negotiating an economic deal which covers and will include tariffs if we succeed, but we will keep all options on the table."" There have been frequent talks between ministers and US officials since the measures were first proposed in February, the BBC understands. The UK hasn't ruled out retaliation in the long term, but that seems unlikely for now. Trump hopes the tariffs will boost US steel and aluminium production in the longer run, but critics say in the immediate term they will raise prices for US consumers and dent economic growth. The EU estimated that the latest measures affect about 5% of its total exports to the US, while the US is the destination for roughly 90% of Canada's steel and aluminium exports. US share prices sank on Monday and Tuesday as traders and analysts expressed recession fears. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) lobby group said the tariffs would boost US steel manufacturing, create jobs, and close a system of exemptions, exclusions and quotas that allowed foreign producers to avoid tariffs. Others in the US do not support the tariffs. Michael DiMarino runs Linda Tool, a Brooklyn company that makes parts for the aerospace industry, said he was concerned prices for steel would rise. ""If I have higher prices, I pass them on to my customers. They have higher prices, they pass it on to the consumer,"" Mr DiMarino said. ""Does the consumer have the money to pay those higher prices, or do they reduce their demand?"" The American Automotive Policy Council, a group that represents car giants such Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said they were concerned tariffs on Canada and Mexico would add ""significant costs"" for car makers' suppliers. In 2018, during his first term as president, Trump imposed similar tariffs on metal imports, but carve-outs were eventually negotiated for many countries. On Tuesday, Trump rescinded his threat to double the tariffs on Canada specifically after Ontario agreed to suspend the surcharge it had placed on electricity.

Jason Roddis had argued with his partner during the night flight to Leeds Bradford Airport in June last year, Bradford Court Court heard.  Roddis, 37, from Bradford, had been drinking from a bottle of wine he brought onto the plane and told one crew member he would ""smash her face in"". He pleaded guilty to being drunk on an aircraft, common assault in relation to the cabin crew, racially aggravated harassment and criminal damage. Prosecutor Ben Sayers said Roddis was being loud and swearing on the flight, with the near-empty wine bottle taken away from him. He was then found to be drinking from another bottle of wine, the hearing heard, which was also confiscated.  Mr Sayers said a cabin crew member tried to give Roddis a disruption notice - a formal warning about their behaviour - but the defendant ripped it up and threw it back. The pilot considered diverting the plane to get Roddis off, the court heard, but the flight was only 30 minutes away from landing at Leeds Bradford Airport. Police arrested him once the plane landed, the sentencing heard. ""The defendant's behaviour lasted for over an hour,"" said Mr Sayers. Representing Roddis, barrister Rebecca Young said he had been in Turkey to look after his mother who had undergone a hip replacement operation. She said he had been drinking on the plane as he suffered from severe anxiety and depression and had not been able to get his medication. The court heard he had 42 previous convictions for 89 offences. Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North."

The firm said ""in a small number of cases"" Grenadier SUV doors are opening while cars are being driven ""increasing the risk of injury to passengers inside the vehicle"". ""Due to insufficient application of grease, an exterior door release button may remain in the depressed position, preventing the door from closing securely"", a spokesperson told the BBC. To fix the problem, Ineos said it will replace all door button assemblies on the affected vehicles, free of charge. The recall affects Ineos' Grenadier SUVs produced between 6 July 2023 and 19 April 2024. The door button mechanism on affected vehicles may have been assembled without enough grease in them, according to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) filing. ""This may allow the exterior door buttons to remain in the depressed position and prevent the door from fully latching,"" the document said. A company spokesperson said: ""We are undertaking a campaign to replace the door lock mechanisms on all affected vehicles as quickly as possible. Owners of all impacted vehicles are being contacted directly."" The recall is the latest issue faced by the car company, which last year had to temporarily pause manufacturing after one of its parts suppliers became insolvent.  Launched in 2022, the Grenadier was the first vehicle produced by Ineos Automotive. It is inspired by the iconic Land Rover Defender. Sir Jim's decision to start the car company was motivated by his disappointment over Jaguar Land Rover's decision to stop making the Defender. In 2020, the entrepreneur, who had campaigned for Leave in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum, announced that the vehicle would be assembled in France, putting an end to hopes that it would be made at a plant in Wales. According to the company, there are currently about 20,000 Grenadiers on the road in 50 countries around the world. Ineos Automotive lost more than 1.4 billion euros (£1.1bn, $1.5bn) before tax in 2023, according to a filing with the UK registry Companies House.

The recall affects Ineos' Grenadier SUVs produced between 6 July 2023 and 19 April 2024. The door button mechanism on affected vehicles may have been assembled without enough grease in them, according to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) filing. ""This may allow the exterior door buttons to remain in the depressed position and prevent the door from fully latching,"" the document said. A company spokesperson said: ""We are undertaking a campaign to replace the door lock mechanisms on all affected vehicles as quickly as possible. Owners of all impacted vehicles are being contacted directly."" The recall is the latest issue faced by the car company, which last year had to temporarily pause manufacturing after one of its parts suppliers became insolvent.  Launched in 2022, the Grenadier was the first vehicle produced by Ineos Automotive. It is inspired by the iconic Land Rover Defender. Sir Jim's decision to start the car company was motivated by his disappointment over Jaguar Land Rover's decision to stop making the Defender. In 2020, the entrepreneur, who had campaigned for Leave in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum, announced that the vehicle would be assembled in France, putting an end to hopes that it would be made at a plant in Wales. According to the company, there are currently about 20,000 Grenadiers on the road in 50 countries around the world. Ineos Automotive lost more than 1.4 billion euros (£1.1bn, $1.5bn) before tax in 2023, according to a filing with the UK registry Companies House. Sir Jim, who is one of the UK's richest people, owns a 27.7% stake in Manchester United."

The pair were due to be on the ISS for only eight days, but because of technical issues with the experimental spacecraft they arrived on, they have been there for more than nine months. The astronauts are due to begin their journey back to Earth later this week. Steve Stich, manager of Nasa's commercial crew programme said he was delighted at the prospect. ""Butch and Suni have done a great job and we are excited to bring them back,"" he said. Live footage showed the SpaceX Crew Dragon docking with the ISS and opening a hatch. Shortly after 0545 GMT, the astronauts embraced and hugged their counterparts. The astronauts, along with their ISS workmates, Nasa's Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, will be relieved by four astronauts, from Russia, Japan and two from the US. There will be a two-day handover after which the old crew are due to begin their journey back to Earth. But there could be a small further delay, as they wait for conditions on Earth to be right for a safe re-entry of the returning capsule, according to Dana Weigel, manager, of the ISS programme. ""Weather always has to cooperate, so we'll take our time over that if it is not favourable,"" she told reporters. Ms Weigel explained that the astronauts had begun getting ready for the handover last week. ""Butch rang a ceremonial bell as Suni handed over command to cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin,"" she said. The astronauts have consistently said that they have been happy to be on board the space station, with Suni Williams describing it as her ""happy place"". But Dr Simeon Barber, of the Open University, told BBC News that there would likely have been a personal cost. ""When you are sent on a work trip that is supposed to last a week, you are not expecting it to take the best part of a year,"" he said. ""This extended stay in space will have disrupted family life, things will have happened back home that they will have missed out on, so there will have been a period of upheaval."" Butch and Suni arrived at the ISS at the beginning of June 2024 to test an experimental spacecraft called Starliner, which was built by the aerospace firm Boeing, a rival to SpaceX.  The mission had been delayed by several years because of technical issues in the spacecraft's development, and there were problems during its launch and docking on to the ISS. This included issues with some of Starliner's thrusters, which would be needed to slow the spacecraft for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, and leaks of helium gas in the propulsion system. Nasa decided that it would not take even a small risk in bringing back Butch and Suni on Starliner, when they had the option of returning them on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Nasa decided the best option was to do this during a scheduled crew rotation, even though it would mean keeping the astronauts on the space station for several months. Boeing has consistently argued that it would have been safe to bring Butch and Suni back on Starliner, and were unhappy about the decision to use a rival's capsule instead, which will be ""embarrassing"" for Boeing, according to Dr Barber. ""It's not a good look for Boeing to see astronauts they took into space come back in a competitor's craft."" Both President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have said that Butch and Suni could have been brought home sooner, most recently in a joint interview with Fox News in February. President Trump states: ""They got left in space."" When the interviewer,  Sean Hannity, elaborates, saying ""They were supposed to be there eight days. They're there almost 300,"" Mr Trump responds with one word: ""Biden."" Mr Musk follows up asserting: ""They were left up there for political reasons."" The assertion is denied by Nasa's Steve Stitch. ""We looked at a wide range of options and worked hand-in-hand with SpaceX to look at what was the best thing to do overall and when we laid all that out the best option was to have the one we are embarking upon,"" he said. That decision was supported by Dr Libby Jackson, who is head of space at the Science Museum in London and worked at Europe's control centre for the ISS. ""Butch and Suni's wellbeing would always have been at the very forefront of everybody's minds as the decisions were being made for how best to deal with the circumstances that they were presented,"" she said. ""Nasa made those decisions based on good technical reasons, on programmatic reasons, and found the right solution that has kept Butch and Suni safe. ""I really look forward to seeing them return to Earth, safe and sound, along with the rest of their crewmates."""
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyjjwxywmko",NA,NA,NA,NA,"After an international week, the Women's Super League returns on Sunday with a busy day of six matches. Unbeaten league leaders Chelsea resume their push for a sixth successive WSL title, holding a seven-point lead at the top with eight league games to go. Sunday's matches are: Manchester United v Leicester City (12:30 GMT - live on BBC iPlayer) Aston Villa v Everton (14:00 GMT) Crystal Palace v Liverpool (14:00 GMT) Tottenham v Manchester City (14:00 GMT) Brighton v Chelsea (15:00 GMT) Arsenal v West Ham (17:30 GMT) Here are some of the talking points ahead of this weekend's games. Chelsea fans have waited to see world record signing Naomi Girma make her first Blues appearance, and she may finally make her debut this weekend. Girma, who Chelsea signed from San Diego Wave for £900,000 in January, has yet to make an appearance as she has been recovering from a calf injury. But she could be set to take to the field on Sunday, when Chelsea take on Brighton, with manager Sonia Bompastor telling a news conference on Friday that defender Girma ""should"" be in the squad. Chelsea are seven points clear at the top of the table and are the only side still unbeaten. Their opponents, Brighton, are fifth and have not won in their past six league games. However, Brighton put up a good showing when these sides met earlier in the season and are bolstered by the return of former Chelsea forward Fran Kirby from injury. ""We'll go in with belief,"" said England international Kirby. ""The last game against Chelsea was probably one of the best performances of the season. Hopefully we can learn from that game. It's going to be a case of every player doing their job - and a half."" Liverpool and Crystal Palace go head to head on Sunday as the clubs begin new phases in the season after sacking Matt Beard and Laura Kaminski this week. Liverpool dismissed manager Beard on Thursday, with the Reds seventh in the WSL table, while bottom-of-the-league Palace announced Kaminski's exit on Friday. Amber Whiteley has taken interim charge of the Reds, with a search for a new manager already under way. Whiteley said in Friday's pre-match news conference she wants the job on a permanent basis. ""I will put my name in the hat, but let's get Palace out of the way first and I can think a bit longer term after that,"" she said. ""I am in a far better position having had the time with Matt and working under him. I'm so grateful to Matt for everything that he has given to me personally over the last three and a bit years. I'm going to miss him."" Palace, who have only won one league match and collected six league points all season, confirmed experienced Norwegian coach Leif Smerud as their new manager. The international break has given teams a break from regular football, but when Manchester City play Tottenham on Sunday it marks the beginning of a gruelling run of eight games in 29 days for Gareth Taylor's City side. They have to contest the League Cup final, both legs of their Women's Champions League quarter-final and a league game against Chelsea, an FA Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa, and other league games against West Ham and Brighton. It is unsurprising, therefore, that manager Taylor says it will be ""really tough"" for his side to get the results they want in March. ""There's a lot going on in this month and I think the conversation will certainly be 'attack the next game, don't try and give too much thought to what's further down the road',"" Taylor said. The situation is made even more difficult by the number of injuries in the squad – including a fresh hamstring issue for Rebecca Knaak – and players having departed. Laura Coombs, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood potentially completing their recoveries from injury could help, but that won't stop it being a tricky few weeks. Chelsea have pulled seven points clear at the top, but it remains tight between the teams who are battling for a spot in Europe. The top three qualify for the Champions League. Manchester United are second with 33 points, Arsenal have 30 and Manchester City have 28. Arsenal boss Renee Slegers has not given up of trying to pip Chelsea to the title. ""We need to believe that, and I do,"" she said. ""We have a very exciting block, full of opportunities ahead of us, and we're going to try and take those opportunities, and that's within our control."" Manchester United manager Marc Skinner also remains optimistic, believing that his side can go on to do ""magnificent things"". ""The reality is we have been going about our business under scrutiny for many years and probably forever will do. We have learned to get on with our job,"" Skinner said. ""There will be good times, there will be bad times. If you treat both of them the same you will be in a balanced position. If we are balanced we are a very good team that can go and do magnificent things."" Leicester gained only their third win of the WSL season on 16 February with a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa to move up to 10th, six points clear of bottom-placed Crystal Palace. But the Foxes' task could not be any tougher in the coming days, as they meet both the top two away from home in the space of four days. They play on Sunday away against a Manchester United side who have won six WSL games in a row. After that, Amandine Miquel's Leicester travel to runaway leaders Chelsea, although the Foxes are the only side to take points off the Blues this season, drawing 1-1 in December. ""The team is ready, they are fighting,"" said Miquel on Thursday. ""We have two games so close so it will be an occasion for most of the players to play. We play opponents of good quality so we will make rotations to be able to have the best teams that we can put on the pitch. ""We want to go to every game like we can win. If we don't feel like that, we might as well not go and stay here. We're going to go for both games to do our best to see if we can get a point or two."""

She takes the hour-long train into her company's Vilnius office once a week, where she uses a car-sharing service to drive herself to client meetings throughout the day. Through an app, she can find where the nearest available car is, and drive off, paying by the minute - a system she finds convenient and flexible. Some providers even include parking in the price, and if she takes an electric car, it's even better, as they qualify for free parking around the city. ""The ability to move around a big city quickly, and not worry about parking, helps me have a more flexible schedule and better control of my time,"" says Ms Mackeviciute, 30, who works in communications. Yet despite being a regular car-sharing user, Ms Mackeviciute still owns a car in Kaunas, which she regularly uses for visiting family living in the countryside. And even while working in Vilnius, occasional issues with car sharing can disrupt Ms Mackeviciute's day. ""It can sometimes be hard to find a vehicle nearby. And sometimes, when you're in a rush the closest vehicle can have not one, but a few, maintenance lights on. While I do understand that fleet maintenance is a challenge, especially as a business grows, it is still disappointing,"" she says. When it comes to cars, most people feel like Ms Mackeviciute - they still want to own one. Despite brands like Zipcar being around since 2000, industry data shows car sharing to still be a niche service. There are just two million car sharing users in the UK, while around 35 million people still own a car. ""Consumers are still tied to exclusive access to their car. Clear scepticism about the ability for car-sharing options to provide a car to hand whenever they need it, and concerns about hassle, are the biggest issues,"" explains Felicity Latcham, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants. ""This concern gets greater for families and older individuals who are particularly tied to being able to leave things in their vehicle."" But the growing electrification of the car sharing market might be attractive to younger, eco-conscious drivers. In a 2023 McKinsey survey of 4,000 people in the UK, France and Germany, 32% of those in the Gen Z bracket said they wanted to use shared-mobility schemes more, wishing to reduce private car reliance. The survey also suggested that 50% of Gen Z also want their next car to be fully electric. The car-sharing industry is heading in that direction. Almost a quarter of European car sharing companies now offer a 100% electric fleet. A third of shared cars in the EU are electric vehicles, data from Statista shows. Meanwhile, Zipcar doubled its electric fleet in 2023 in the UK, with plans to go fully electric this year. Spark, the Lithuanian car-sharing company Ms Mackeviciute frequently uses, launched with a fully electric fleet in 2016. Its recent performance has been encouraging, with a registered user base up by 30% since 2022, and annual trip numbers up by 11%. Since July last year, users of the Bolt ride-sharing app - the Baltic states' answer to Uber - can also now book Spark vehicles. Spark founder Nerijus Dagilis is confident that the increasing availability of electric vehicles can get more people on board with car sharing, especially with the support of the city of Vilnius, which, on top of free parking for electric cars, allows them to be driven in bus lanes, too. ""Our customer pool is increasing every month, so that means we are creating a certain value for people, who prefer electric cars for sustainability reasons. It's becoming a daily habit for many people, especially families - we see more of them downsizing from two cars to one,"" says Mr Dagilis. ""The performance of electric cars is improving quickly, so while there is still some scepticism, as soon as an electric car can drive 500km on a single charge, I think people's anxiety should disappear."" Canada's Kite is a car sharing company with a twist. Not only is it fully electric, but it partners with property developers to offer Kite cars to apartment building residents as either an included service, or for a subsidised membership fee, akin to a gym or pool. A Kite hub is installed usually on the first level of the building's underground parking, for residents to book their choice of up to 40 fully charged electric cars. In some locations, Kite users have the option of returning their car to a different building. Kite is currently live in 20 buildings across Canada, with plans to add 70 more in the next 18 months, adding properties in the US and Europe. Kite founder, Scott MacWillam, says the convenience and saving they offer to prospective residents is a draw. ""There's a growing trend of more people with a busy city life wanting a 'turnkey' lifestyle. Real estate developers see this as a sales and marketing advantage,"" says Mr MacWilliam. ""Residents can save money by kind of ditching their privately-owned car, and that cost saving means they now can afford to live in the building, or maybe they can even upgrade their apartment."" Mr MacWilliam says Kite gives thousands of building residents the chance to try both car sharing, and an electric vehicle, without any pressure or commitment, in a package where everything is covered - from charging and maintenance to insurance. Kite is also hoping to install Kite hubs at train stations and introduce autonomous cars. ""What I'm most excited about, is we could fundamentally change the way buildings are built, forever,"" he says."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7vjlv7pzdo","'I'm a little angry': Canadian firms boycott US products",2025-03-17,"Sam Gruet","Business reporter","Made in Canada. Three words that are now a common presence on Canadian shelves, after Donald Trump's tariffs sparked a trade war with the US's northern neighbour. In Canada the economic measures against it have been met with a wave of patriotism, with some consumers and businesses boycotting American products.  Others with operations in the US face a choice - ride out the uncertainty or bring their enterprise back home. ""Right now, I'm a little angry. I don't want to invest in American companies,"" says Joanna Goodman, owner of Au Lit Fine Linens, a Toronto-based bedding and nightwear company. ""It's about having your eggs in one basket. And right now, that basket is very reckless and very precarious,"" she continues. On a tour around one of her firm's two stores, housed in a giant warehouse, Ms Goodman highlights elegantly made-up beds, mannequins in silk pyjamas, and shelves full of sweet-smelling candles – most of it made in Canada. But one fifth of the stock currently comes from the US. Ms Goodman is quick to point out, ""you see how big the store is, so even 20% is a lot"". ""I have a lot of inventory here of American brands that I've had relationships with for 20 years. I'm not going to throw it away,"" she says. ""The question is, will I reorder?"" To show Au Lit Fine Linens' commitment to Canadian manufacturers, its stores now highlight everything that is Canadian made. This is mirrored on its website, which has a ""shop all made in Canada"" section, and says ""made right here at home"". From Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, to the Ukraine war, global events in recent years have given rise to a more recent phenomenon – reshoring. Bringing business operations back to home shores, it is the reversal of offshoring. Business leader and recently-appointed new member of Canada's Senate, Sandra Pupatello, says that reshoring is ""really obvious"" to support. Pupatello, who had previously been Ontario's Minister of Economic Development and Trade, points to the Covid-19 pandemic, when rules of trade ""went right out the window"". She specifically cites the example of US mask manufacturer 3M coming under pressure from the White House in 2020 to halt exports to Canada and Latin America. In that moment Pupatello thought: ""We've got to be prepared for the worst"". Shortly after, she established Reshoring Canada, a non-partisan group advocating for a more resilient supply chain in Canada. Pupatello tells the BBC: ""If the going gets tough, Canada is on its own. And if we know that's the case, let us plan for it."" A Canadian government report from last year found that there had ""not been signs of either large-scale or any notable increased reshoring by businesses"", but things could now be changing. Ray Brougham has been trying to make inroads into the Canadian car manufacturing sector since establishing his company Rainhouse Manufacturing Canada in 2001. Based in British Columbia, it manufactures parts for a number of industries. The North American car industry's integrated supply chains can see parts crossing the borders between the US, Mexico, and Canada multiple times before a vehicle is finally assembled. US President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare US carmakers from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect in March. But in the shadow of a trade war, Mr Brougham says he has had ""good communications"" with a large Canadian auto parts company for the first time ever. ""All of a sudden they are interested in working closer with other Canadian companies."" For Mr Brougham and others, the benefits of reshoring are clear. From giving a leg up to small companies that have struggled to compete with manufacturers overseas, to ensuring fair wages, and the environmental benefits of importing and exporting fewer goods. Others, including Graham Markham, director of a food sector supplier, believe it's about adding value to products Canada already produces. His Canadian firm New Protein International is currently constructing Canada's first soy protein manufacturing plant in southwest Ontario, just miles from the US border. Canada is the world's fourth-largest exporter of the crop, but most of it is processed overseas. ""We don't process those value-added ingredients into more valuable ingredients here at home,"" says Mr Markham. From critical minerals and uranium to lumber and soybeans, he argues that this is the moment to change. ""Canada has long been a successful supplier of raw materials to the world. The opportunity now is to stop exporting the job creation and innovation that comes from processing those materials domestically."" So, could manufacturing start coming back to Canada?  Economist Randall Bartlett says it is too early to tell. ""There's a lot more smoke than there is fire when it comes to actual reorganisation of supply chains and moving them domestically,"" says Mr Bartlett, senior director of Canadian economics at Quebec-based Desjardins. ""I think there has been some movement toward reshoring, but I think there's a lot more narrative around it than there is actual re-establishing of manufacturing capacity."" There are major hurdles too. The highly-integrated auto industry, for example, would take years to untangle. Reshoring it would require ""many tens of hundreds of billions of dollars in both private and public sector investment to make happen"", according to Mr Bartlett. Then there's the reality of global trade. ""Some countries are better at producing some things than other countries are,"" Mr Bartlett says, suggesting that rather than a full reshoring push, diversifying Canada's trade partners might be more practical. He says that Canada should focus on ""those industries where we have a comparative advantage"", which he says include renewable energy and processing steel and aluminium. Those two metals have now been hit with a 25% tariff if they are exported to the US. Back at Au Lit Fine Linens in Toronto, Joanna Goodman steps into a vast stockroom, filled with the sound of carboard boxes being packed. ""We're shipping orders to the US that came in pre-tariffs,"" she explains, before pausing.  ""We did get an order the day of the tariffs starting, and it was a very decent-sized order."" She says that she doesn't know whether the US buyer understands that tariffs will now apply. ""He has to ask Mr Trump [why]"". As for what comes next?  ""These tariffs could be gone any day. Let's see how it all unfolds, then we'll start making decisions,"" says Ms Goodman. Like many Canadian businesses, she's waiting for the dust to settle before deciding where to buy, where to sell, and what Made in Canada really means for the future."

Gardaí (Irish police) are investigating after what is described as ""criminal damage"" was caused to the Trump International Golf Links Ireland in Doonbeg, County Clare. BBC News NI understands that the damage was confined to the course, and it included graffiti linked to the Israel-Gaza conflict in the Middle East. The graffiti is believed to have been in support of Palestine and critical of the US president. Gardaí are appealing for witnesses, and in particular those who were in the area from around teatime on Wednesday until midnight. President Trump has visited the course previously and some members of his family are regular visitors to the resort. The vandalism came just hours after Trump hosted Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin at the White House during annual St Patrick's Day celebrations. During their meeting in the Oval Office, the president told the taoiseach that he hopes to visit Doonbeg again in the near future. He said he would like to meet Martin at the resort. The Doonbeg course was bought by The Trump Organisation in 2014. Last weekend, a pro-Palestinian group vandalised parts of Donald Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland. Palestine Action posted photographs on social media showing red paint daubed across one of the buildings at the Ayrshire course. The words ""Gaza is not for sale"" was sprayed across one green and another green appeared to have been dug up."

But her concerns increased following an abusive relationship with a partner, who later stalked her.  Although police intervened, she left the UK and also scaled back her online profile. ""I erased my online presence as much as I possibly could, including removing the locations of some posts, and a couple of Instagram accounts,"" says Ms Smith, whose name has been changed for this article. Ms Smith, who works in communications, still has a LinkedIn account but doesn't use her full name. ""I deleted quite a few things off my LinkedIn too, lots of things that were location based, although a few posts do remain. ""I have posted recently as I'm trying to build a brand although I'm sceptical as to how much I share."" She has kept an original private Facebook account: ""I cleanse it once a year, and check on photos and privacy of posts and where I have been tagged."" Ms Smith has also become more aware of the terms and conditions of social media platforms. ""I follow AI trends and I know a lot of images are training AI models and we don't have ethical guidelines on how they can be used. That's another massive factor why I will never put my child on social media as the images can be used for whatever want."" As scams become more sophisticated, research suggests that more people are concerned about the information they share online. In a report by Statista, 39% of respondents said they were worried about how companies use their online data, while a quarter (26%) admitted to using a VPN. There are a number of reasons why people might want to reduce their online profiles. ""First of all, people underappreciate privacy,"" says Vytautas Kaziukonis, chief executive at Surfshark, a security software company that encrypts user's online data and aims to make browsing secure. ""What might be innocent information right now might be bring you into difficulties 10 years down the line, for example, if there's a change of laws, or political environment."" Another issue is the explosion of AI, says Mr Kaziukonis. ""Fraud is getting better and better, and one thing that is essential for all scams is having data,"" he says. AI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a ""deadly combination"", says Mr Kaziukonis.  Also, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers. Mr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. ""It's the Wild West out there,"" he says. So what can we do to minimise our footprints? Firstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online. ""Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,"" says Mr Kaziukonis. ""It could be leaked and used against you."" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. ""That limits the spamming."" It's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted.  ""They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,"" says Mr Kaziukonis. Gus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint. He suggests using a VPN (virtual private network) which, for a price, offers a user more privacy when online.  He also recommends cookie-blockers and selecting web browsers with privacy controls. ""The underlying solution remains that we must keep the pressure on our governments to have strong laws to protect everyone,"" Mr Hosein says. Karen Renaud is a computing scientist at the University of Strathclyde  working on security and privacy. Last year she studied 15 privacy policy documents, which lay out what a company is going to do with your data. She found that the most complicated of them would take 32 minutes to read and would require college-level education to understand. ""The situation is pretty dire,"" she says. She advises it's a good idea to clear out the cookies on your browser from time to time, and reduce the cookies you accept. ""Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches."" Some people turn to services such as DeleteMe and Surfshark, which help remove personal information from data brokers. Amanda Unterreiner, product manager at US-based data removal service DeleteMe, says high-profile individuals like video gamers and judges use their service as a safety measure. ""In the case of judges… because if they're announcing some decision, someone might show up at their house."" She also mentions the case of the killing earlier last year of United Healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson. ""Stories like that kind of spark regular people to think I better get protected."" Ms Unterreiner went through the process of having her data removed when she joined the company. ""You could see every other place I had ever lived, every phone number I've ever had, every email address, on the first page of Google. If someone wanted to steal my identity… they would be able to cause some real personal damage."" The company also offers a service to mask your house on Google Maps. ""You can look at street view, but that particular property will just be kind of very pixelated."" There's multiple reasons why Saam Collingwood, who lives near Stratford-upon-Avon, has cut back her online profile over the years.  The first was following an incident at work where she had included her personal Facebook account on an email to a client and her employer was unhappy. ""They were able to see photos from a night out,"" she says. ""That didn't go down too well."" In another incident she was trolled by a stranger online after posting a video of herself learning a dance routine on YouTube. Plus, rising online fraud convinced her to further reduce her online profile. She hasn't completely erased her online presence but she no longer posts regularly on Facebook, reducing it about twice a year.  ""I don't like it when people tag me, people knowing I'm not at home. Most times I remove the tag."" She says she has upgraded her anti-virus and security software with a service from online security firm Norton.  ""I wanted to make sure websites weren't taking my details. It makes me more comfortable."" But are there any downsides to not being so present online? ""I miss seeing old friends [on Facebook] and people I would contact once or twice year,"" says Ms Smith.

Defeat by France in Paris consigned the Scots to a fourth-place Six Nations finish for the second successive season. Of Townsend's eight attempts at the tournament, Scotland have finished in the bottom half of the table on six occasions, with two third-place finishes the best his team has achieved in that time. It was another Six Nations of unfulfilled promise, with victories over Italy and Wales and defeats by Ireland, England and the champions France. And Wright believes a new voice in charge may be what the team needs to break through to finally become credible challengers. ""I don't like saying this, but I genuinely think it's a time for a change at the top end,"" Wright told the BBC's Scotland Rugby Podcast. ""Gregor's been here a long time and he's changed and he's made the team play some great, exciting rugby.  ""But ultimately he's not had any real success in the Six Nations or the World Cups - out twice before the knockout stages, although we've had two really tough groups. ""It's one thing about changing the style and being exciting and good to watch, but ultimately we want to try and be competing at the top end. ""Are we delusional to think that we're actually good enough to compete at the top end? I would say with this group of players, we should be. ""I think Gregor's a really good coach, and I think the guys he's got round about him are good guys, but maybe it's just a new voice that's needed."" Townsend admits Scotland fell short of their own expectations in the Six Nations, this season but believes this side is still moving in the right direction. ""I felt we were building towards our best tournament this year,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""We came very close last year to finishing in the top two.  ""This year, having the display against South Africa, then the win against Australia, leading into the tournament, we all felt confident this would be a better tournament. But it didn't happen. ""We're up against quality sides. I don't think any team delivers their best performance over the five games - there was no Grand Slam again this year. ""I've actually been more encouraged this year by how we played than I was last year.  ""The mix of our carrying, our defence and the speed we play through the back line, it gives me a lot of optimism for the future. But it wasn't to be this season.""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yxv7wylz7o","Software bug at firm left NHS data 'vulnerable to hackers'",2025-03-10,"Ben Morris","Editor, Technology of Business","The NHS is ""looking into"" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company.  The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month in England. The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.  Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised. The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered. In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems. An NHS spokesperson said: ""We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate."" Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data. However, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said. The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered. ""When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'."" The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.  The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information. He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.  ""I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,"" he said. On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do. Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure. It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was ""extremely open"".  Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), ""in the interests of transparency"", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach. The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January. In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: ""There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems."" He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours. ""The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false."" The security agency will complete its review later this week.  Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: ""We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.""  Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.  ""There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey. ""The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,"" he added.  Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified. ""Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,"" says Scott Helme, a security researcher. Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across England.  In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector. ""Individual NHS organisations must ensure they meet their legal responsibilities and national data security standards to protect patient data when appointing suppliers, and we offer them support and training nationally on how this should be done."""

They hope to follow in the footsteps of former Down gaelic footballer Charlie Smyth, who secured a place on the New Orleans Saints practice squad via the programme in 2024. Established in 2017, the IPP programme aims to provide elite international athletes with the opportunity to compete at the NFL level, improve their skills and ultimately work to earn a spot on an NFL roster. Smyth's hopes of forging an NFL career remain alive after he signed a new contract with the Saints last month, which guarantees him at least another off-season with the team. In November, Derryman Jude McAtamney became the first Irish-born placekicker to feature in a regular season NFL game since 1985 when he made his New York Giants debut in a game against the Washington Commanders.

Duterte was arrested at Manila airport on Tuesday and within hours was on a chartered jet which flew via Dubai to The Hague, where the ICC sits. The 79-year-old could become the first Asian former head of state to go on trial at the ICC. Duterte, who contested his extradition, led the Philippines from 2016 to 2022 and presided over a violent ""war on drugs"" that saw thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others killed without trial. The Gulfstream G550 landed in Dubai for a stopover early on Wednesday and its expected departure was delayed for several hours while Duterte received medical checks, Reuters news agency reports. Once the plane had landed in Rotterdam, the ICC confirmed that Duterte was in its custody to face charges ""of murder as a crime against humanity"". ""A hearing will be scheduled in due course for Mr Duterte's initial appearance before the Court.""   Meanwhile the former leaders' supporters gathered outside The Hague Penitentiary Institution protesting his arrest. Many of them waved the Philippine flag, while others mimicked Duterte's signature fist-pumping gesture.  ""We stand with Duterte,"" read a banner held up by supporters. Duterte's main political rival, current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, was instrumental in handing him over. Minutes after Duterte left Philippines airspace, Marcos gave a televised address saying the country was fulfilling its legal obligation. ""This is what the international community expects of us,"" Marcos said. The Duterte and Marcos families are the Philippines' most powerful political dynasties. They joined forces to sweep the country's last national election in 2022, but have fallen out in recent months as they pursued separate agendas. Duterte being handed to the ICC is the latest twist in a political feud that has unfolded spectacularly in the public view. The Duterte and Marcos families formed a formidable alliance in the 2022 elections. Against the elder Duterte's wishes, his daughter Sara ran as Marcos Jr's vice-president instead of seeking her father's post.  Marcos initially refused to co-operate with the ICC investigation, but as his relationship with the Duterte family deteriorated, he changed his stance. Vice-President Duterte said her father's arrest amounted to ""kidnapping"", claiming it violated Philippine sovereignty. She left Manila for the Netherlands on Wednesday, according to her office. Rodrigo Duterte previously insisted that the ICC has no jurisdiction over the Philippines, since he pulled the country out of the tribunal in 2019, three years after it took note of the drug war's rising death toll. But according to the Rome Statute that is the basis for the ICC, the court maintains jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed before a nation leaves the tribunal. The ICC investigation covers 2011-2019, which includes the period when Duterte was mayor of Davao, a sprawling metropolis in the country's south, where his family has held power for decades. Complaints filed against Duterte at the ICC allege that he kept a ""death squad"" of bounty hunters to go after drug suspects in Davao, and later replicated this model on a national scale when he was elected president. Human Rights Watch called Duterte's arrest a ""critical step for accountability in the Philippines"". Duterte built a reputation for Davao as one of the Philippines' safest cities, and cultivated the image of a tough-talking, anti-establishment man of the masses to pull off a dark horse win in the 2016 presidential elections. Polls show he is the most popular Philippines president since the restoration of democracy in 1986. His supporters have threatened to hold large rallies to protest against his arrest. They had asked the Supreme Court to issue a restraining order against the ICC warrant - but the court did not act before the former president was flown out on Tuesday. On social media, where the Dutertes maintain a strong following, the reaction was mixed. Many praised the ICC for delivering justice for those who died in the drug war, while others defended Duterte's legacy, with some calling for widespread rallies. ""Justice served,"" read a top-liked comment on TikTok.  ""Philippines was safe during Duterte's time,"" another TikTok user wrote, saying the former leader built bridges, roads and other infrastructure. ""He was the best president.""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyve80jjm97o","Public inquiry to start into airport night flights",2025-03-11,"Spencer Stokes","Transport Correspondent, BBC Yorkshire","A public inquiry into night-time flying rules at Leeds Bradford Airport's is set to begin later.  Ahead of the hearing, BBC Yorkshire's Transport Correspondent Spencer Stokes takes a look at the key issues at stake. Chaired by an independent planning inspector, the inquiry will consider the legal meaning of the night-time flying rules at Leeds Bradford Airport (LBA). Currently the airport is permitted 2,920 take offs and landings between 23:00 and 07:00 during the summer. However, campaign group Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport (GALBA) say the airport has breached that limit in each of the past three years. But LBA chief executive, Vincent Hodder says the rules, agreed by Leeds City Council in 1994, do not take into account changes to aircraft technology over the past 30 years to reduce noise. GALBA say LBA has exceeded its night-time flight limits in 2022, 2023, and 2024 - in the most recent year it said the airport operated 820 more flights than permitted. The airport has admitted it did ""accidentally"" breach the night time regulations in 2022 due to ""errors taking place in reporting procedures"", but claimed it had not gone over in 2023 and 2024 based on its interpretation of the rules. In a bid to update the 1994 planning consents, LBA applied to Leeds City Council last year for a Certificates of Lawfulness of Existing Use Development (CLEUDs). It said updating the rules would ""provide the correct legal interpretation of the existing planning conditions governing the operation of night flights at LBA"". However, two CLEUD applications were rejected by the council and the third was left ""undecided"", prompting LBA to appeal to the government's planning inspectorate. Leeds City Council agreed the original planning consent in 1994 permitting 2,920 night flights, and is responsible for monitoring to make sure LBA does not breach the night time flights cap. It issued a breach of condition notice against LBA for the additional flights in 2022 and accepted the rules were broken again in 2023, but said the public interest for a prosecution had not been met. No action has been taken after the alleged breach in summer 2024. The European Commission said aircraft have become 75% quieter over the last 30 years, but an increase in the number of flights has resulted in a rise in noise disturbance for a greater number of people. Jet2, who are based at Leeds Bradford Airport, have ordered 146 Airbus A320 Neo aircraft, which the airline said are 50% quieter than their current Boeing 737s. The Planning Inspector will hear evidence for four days, but it's likely to be several weeks or months before the final decision is announced. GALBA says if LBA is successful at public inquiry ""they will continue to fly hundreds more night flights than the original rules intended to allow."". The airport said it would not be going through the ""difficult, time-consuming and expensive process if this wasn't important to our customers and the airport"".

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6253ly20p4o","Not enough power to share: The political feud behind Rodrigo Duterte's downfall",2025-03-11,"Jonathan Head","South East Asia Correspondent","Just short of his 80th birthday, Rodrigo Duterte, a man who once vowed to purge his country through a bloody anti-drugs and crime campaign, found himself outmanoeuvred and in custody. The former president was met by Philippines police as he arrived in Manila on a flight from Hong Kong, where he had been rallying support for his candidates for the upcoming mid-term election among the large Filipino diaspora there.  The much-talked-about warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court (ICC) was, it turned out, already in the hands of the Philippines government, which moved swiftly to execute it.  A frail-looking Mr Duterte, walking with a stick, was moved to an air force base within the airport perimeter. A chartered jet was quickly prepared to take him to the ICC in The Hague. How had this happened? How had a man so powerful and popular, often called ""the Trump of Asia"", been brought so low?  In vain, his lawyers and family members protested that the arrest had no legal basis and complained that Duterte's frail health was being neglected. While in office, Mr Duterte formed an alliance with the Marcos family – the children of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos who had long been working on a political comeback. Mr Duterte could not run again in the 2022 election, but his daughter Sara, mayor of southern city of Davao, was also popular and a strong contender to replace him. However, Ferdinand Marcos's son Bongbong, who had been in politics all his life, was also well placed to win and very well-funded.  The two families struck a deal. They would work together to get Bongbong into the presidency and Sara into the vice-presidency, on the assumption that come the next election in 2028, her turn would come and she would have the formidable Marcos machine behind her.  It worked. Both won their positions by a wide margin. Mr Duterte expected that his alliance would protect him from any blowback over his controversial presidency once he was out of power. The most serious threat hanging over him was an investigation by the ICC into his culpability for thousands of extrajudicial killings carried out during anti-drugs campaigns he ordered - after he became president in 2016, but also during his tenure as mayor of the southern city of Davao from 2011.  Mr Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the ICC in 2019, but its prosecutors argued they still had a mandate to look into alleged crimes against humanity committed before that, and launched a formal investigation in 2021. However, President Marcos initially stated that his government would not co-operate with the ICC. That position only changed after the dramatic breakdown of the Duterte-Marcos alliance. Strains in their relationship were evident from the earliest days of the administration, when Sara Duterte's request to be given control of the powerful defence ministry was turned down and she was given the education ministry instead.  President Marcos also distanced himself from his predecessor's mercurial policies, mending fences with the US, standing up to China in contested seas, and stopping the blood-curdling threats of retribution against drug dealers. In the end, these were two ambitious, power-hungry clans aiming to dominate Filipino politics, and there was not enough power for them to share. Relations reached a nadir last year when Sara Duterte announced that she had hired an assassin to kill President Marcos, should anything happen to her.  Late last year, the lower house of Congress, which is controlled by Marcos loyalists, filed a petition to impeach Ms Duterte. That trial is due to take place in the Senate later this year.  If she is impeached, under the constitution, she would be barred from holding high political office, killing her long-standing presidential ambitions and weakening the political power of the Dutertes even further. President Marcos now appears to have moved deftly to neutralise his main political rival. But his strategy is not risk-free. The Dutertes remain popular in much of the country, and may be able to mobilise protests against the former president's prosecution.  Sara Duterte has issued a statement accusing the government of surrendering her father to ""foreign powers"" and of violating Filipino sovereignty. An early test of the support enjoyed by both clans will be the mid-term elections in May.  In his comments to journalists after the plane carrying his predecessor had taken off from Manila, President Marcos insisted he was meeting the country's commitments to Interpol, which had delivered the ICC warrant. But he was coy about the fact that it was an ICC warrant he was executing, given that many Filipinos will question what the ICC's remit is in a country which has already left its jurisdiction. It is not risk-free for the ICC either. The court is an embattled institution these days, with the Trump administration threatening to arrest its top officials should they travel to the US, and few countries willing to extradite those it has indicted. Getting former President Duterte to The Hague might therefore look like a welcome high-profile success.  But there was a warning, from China – admittedly not a signatory to the ICC and currently at loggerheads with the Philippines – not to politicise ICC cases. This was a thinly-veiled reference to the fact that this case, which is supposed to be about accountability for serious international crimes, has ended up playing a decisive part in a domestic feud in the Philippines between two rival political forces."

Professor Jennifer Watling, of Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU), said the restriction, introduced in 2024, has led to a fall in the number overseas admissions.  She said international students brought ""value in terms of cultural richness and diversity"" but were also important sources of funding which many universities rely on.  A government spokesman said while the UK values the contribution international students make, ""net migration must come down"".  The Labour government has previously said it has no plans to lift the ban on relatives arriving with international students, which was brought in under the Conservative government to curb migration. International student visa applications have fallen across some universities since the change was introduced according to Home Office figures.  Prof Watling said the cap on fees for domestic students meant universities ""have to obtain income from sources other than UK students"". UK undergraduates fees are set to rise to £9,535 a year from September. International students studying at the same level pay an average of about £22,000 annually, though some pay as much as £38,000, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) said. There are more than 51,000 international students at universities in the north west of England, according to 2024 admission figures from advocacy group Universities UK.  A study by think tank the Higher Education Policy Institute found income from these fees can be vital to universities.  Rose Stephenson from the Institute, said: ""For Manchester, there was an economic benefit of £450 million which actually translates to over £3,500 per resident, again per cohort of international students coming in."" Despite the falls in admissions, international students are still attracted by opportunities in the UK, Margarida Vasconcelos, a digital marketing student at MMU, said. She said: ""There are a lot of international students and opportunities, people from different cultures, religions, so it makes it us feel more welcome - it was why I wanted to come to Manchester.""

The S&P 500, which tracks the biggest American companies, fell about 2% in early trade, while the Dow Jones dropped 0.9% and the Nasdaq sank more than 3.5%. The falls came after President Donald Trump ducked questions about whether the US economy was facing a recession or price rises as a result of tariff moves, while warning instead of a ""period of transition"". Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, however, insisted there would be no contraction in the US, although he acknowledged that the price of some goods may rise. Investors fear that tariffs - which are taxes on goods applied as they enter the country - will lead to higher prices and ultimately dent growth in the world's largest economy. ""The level of tariffs that Trump is imposing, I think no doubt, will have to cause inflation somewhere down the line,"" Rachel Winter, investment manager at Killik & Co, told the Today programme. Economist Mohamed El-Erian said investors had been optimistic about Trump's plans for de-regulation and lower taxes, while under-estimating the likelihood of a trade war.  He said the recent falls in the stock market, which started last week, reflect the adjustment of those bets.  ""It's a complete change in what the market expected,"" he added, noting that investors are also responding to signs that businesses and households are starting to hold off on spending amid the uncertainty, which could hurt economic growth.  European stocks closed lower on Monday, with France's CAC and the London FTSE indices both closing around 0.9% lower. Germany's DAX closed 1.75% lower. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was because of ""unease around the impact of Trump tariffs"". She added that concerns over the US economy entering a recession is worrying investors.  Tesla shares fell about 8% on Monday, while tech stocks Nvidia and Meta were both down more than 4%. Speaking to Fox News in an interview broadcast on Sunday but recorded on Thursday, Trump appeared to acknowledge the concerns, responding to a question about whether the US was facing recession: ""I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing."" ""It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,"" he added. The US president has accused China, Mexico and Canada of not doing enough to end the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US. The three countries have rejected the accusations. He imposed new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada last week, but then exempted many of those goods just two days later. Trump also doubled a blanket tariff on goods from China to 20%.  The US is now facing retaliation, including new tit-for-tat tariffs from China targeting US farm products that came into effect on Monday.  They mean US exports including chicken, beef, pork, wheat, and soybeans face new tariffs of 10% to 15%. Ontario premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, also said he was going forward with a 25% surcharge on energy exports to the US, announced in retaliation for the tariffs.  If Trump escalates, ""I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely,"" he warned.  Speaking on NBC on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged: ""Foreign goods may get a little more expensive"".  ""But American goods are going to get cheaper,"" he said. But when asked whether the US economy could face a recession he added: ""Absolutely not… There's going to be no recession in America."" Former US Commerce Department official, Frank Lavin, told the BBC that he thinks the trade war is unlikely to escalate out of control. But while tariffs will eventually ""fade a bit"" they will still be an ""extra burden on the US economy,"" he said. Han Shen Lin, China country director at consultancy firm The Asia Group, told the BBC's Today programme: ""You're seeing a lot of tit for tat between both sides to demonstrate that neither side will back off easily. ""That said China has realised it probably can't export its way to GDP growth in the way that it used to so it is focusing a lot more on the domestic economy right now."""

She said a lot has changed over the years to encourage more women to join the service. Ms Pink has said it is a ""fabulous"" role but potential firefighters need to ""see it to be it"".  ""You've got to have the role models so other people can look at you and think if she can do it, I can do it,"" she said ""When I started 20 years I thought you had to be a bodybuilder and an athlete. ""You do hold these preconceptions about a traditional firefighter and it's not actually like that."" Grace Pye is a beauty pageant queen with a farming background. She is also studying A level mathematics and plans to continue with the subject at university. She believes more needs to be done to help girls realise they can study a science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subject. ""From a young age I always loved maths, when I walked into my first A level maths class there were 30 students and only two of them were girls,"" she said. The 18-year-old who was recently crowned Miss teen Lancashire 2025 said she got into pageants to boost her self esteem and confidence. ""I do tend to bring it up whenever I have interviews, I say yes I'm a beauty pageant queen but I'm also this I don't have to be defined as one or the other,"" she said. ""Girls are really taught to care more about their looks than the power of their mind and I think that's a really key fault in getting women into any of the male dominated areas."" Becky Cartmell works at the Air Traffic Control Tower at Blackpool Airport. She said the number of women working in the aviation industry has gone up over the years, but she'd like to see more female pilots. ""When I started in 2018 I felt like it was a male dominated role, but I've never felt out of place here I love all my colleagues it's brilliant, its such a good job,"" the 34-year-old said. ""It's still unusual to hear a female pilot on frequency but it's happening more which is really nice. ""It's an absolutely fantastic career, I'd encourage any woman even to just visit a control tower and see what we do. I'd encourage any woman to be a pilot, there is a niche out there and anyone can do it."" Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram."

Hannah Renton is the co-writer and director of the new film, entitled Gossip. Ms Renton, from east London, shot Gossip on the Essex coast and officially launched the film on International Women's Day (IWD). Ms Renton hopes the film, which will be shown across Essex and Suffolk, will encourage people to look at issues women still face today. ""The reason why the film is called Gossip is it's a word that is still very strong in our cultural minds, but the origins of the word were the women who accompanied women through birth,"" Ms Renton explained ""Then the meaning became just a female friend and slowly it came to have these negative connotations of women talk."" The project draws from the region's history of witch trials and the struggles faced by women of the time. Ms Renton felt it was important to launch the film on IWD ""not only because the film foregrounds women and their history, but because it speaks to IWD's political history and the idea that we cannot achieve women's liberation without radical change"". She also believed understanding women's history was key to understanding issues many still face today. ""There are some parallels today; it's not the same at all, but the reason I used a contemporary title was to match that connection in a way, thinking to bodily autonomy, reproductive rights and gendered violence,"" she added. ""It's hard for us to imagine what happened then and actually in the making of this film I realised it's closer than we think... there's parts of the world that are not so different. ""I think our understanding of history, our connection to history, is such an essential part of how we move forward."" The film is touring from 28 March to 17 April, with screenings at The Quay Theatre in Sudbury, Suffolk Archives in Ipswich, East Anglian Folklore Centre in Colchester and more.

Shankland has been dropped this time and finds himself replaced in Steve Clarke's national squad with strike partner James Wilson, whose first call-up came just days after turning 18, for next week's Nations League play-off against Greece. Craig Gordon was included again having re-established himself as the nation's number one goalkeeper at the age of 42. ""Incredible, at both ends of the spectrum,"" Critchley said. ""It's just as much an achievement for Craig as it is for James and at least James will have someone to look after him, which is nice."" While Wilson has found the net six times in 24 appearances since breaking into the first team this season, 29-year-old Shankland's scoring rate has dropped to four in 34. ""Shanks is a super professional,"" Critchley said. ""He's a great guy and naturally you'd be disappointed - I'd expect him to be. ""He's out there doing extra today, as he always does with his finishing. I know he'll be concentrating on performing his best for us, starting with the game tomorrow - between now and the end of the season - and if that happens then I'm sure at some point he'll be back in international contention."" Wilson revealed earlier this week that his ""head was spinning"" after Critchley broke the news to him about his inclusion. ""It's a special moment, isn't it?"" the Hearts boss said. ""I found out the morning of the announcement. ""I pulled James after a team meeting to tell him and he was obviously taken aback by the news - I don't think he was expecting it.

Critchley said the club's academy staff ""should be immensely proud"" as ""he sort of typifies the exact type of person you want to produce"". With Norwich City's Angus Gunn again missing out through injury, Gordon is likely to start against the Greeks ahead of Rangers' Liam Kelly and Ipswich Town's Cieran Slicker. ""They're important games, big games coming up for Scotland and I know what it'll mean to Craig if he still is the number one,"" Critchley added. ""He's been fantastic.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w0l414rv4o","Girls in England lag behind boys in maths and science study",2025-03-10,"Hayley Clarke","Education reporter","A gender gap has opened up between boys and girls in maths and science subjects in England, a new report suggests. The international study, carried out every four years and published by the Department for Education, found that the gap between boys and girls in Year 5 and Year 9 was significantly larger than in previous versions of the study. The gap in Year 9 maths in England was wider than in any other country taking part in the study, with boys scoring 26 points higher than girls. In 2020, the gap was two points. Schools Minister Catherine McKinnell said the government will continue to promote science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects, ""especially among girls"". The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), was carried out by researchers at University College London (UCL). The latest report uses data gathered in 2023. In science, Year 9 boys in the study were 14 points ahead of girls. In the previous report, published in 2020 using 2019 data, girls scored three points higher than boys.  Jennie Golding, a co-author of the report from the Institute of Education at UCL, believes issues around confidence and a sense of belonging could be possible reasons why girls' performance has suffered. But she said more research was needed to understand and address it, with boys and girls getting similar TIMSS scores in previous studies. Mary Richardson, the report's other co-author, said: ""It is possible that some of the effects of Covid, learning loss and changes to learning environments are now revealing themselves."" This is the first time the assessment has been fully digital, which may have had an impact on scores, researchers said. A gender gap has opened up in favour of boys since the last report in comparative countries too, such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In England, the gap is much closer when looking at Year 6 Sats results for 2024, where girls continued to outperform boys at the expected standard in all subjects apart from maths, where boys outperformed girls by one percentage point. It is a similar story for older age groups doing their GCSEs and A-levels, where boys tend to outperform girls in maths and science but to a lesser degree than in the latest TIMSS study. Part of the TIMSS study also found that more boys reported feeling ""very confident"" in maths than girls. Tanya Tracey, chief executive of the charity Girls Are Investors, said many of the girls and young women they support have a fear of failure and lack confidence. The charity tries to encourage more women and girls to pursue careers in the male-dominated investing sector, through mentorship and workshops. ""Part of the job is knowing you won't get it right all the time - that's a surprise to many girls I think. They always think they have to be perfect,"" she added. The government said it would be looking at how to ensure all children get a strong foundation in maths through its curriculum and assessment review. The schools minister said it was important to ""break the link between background and success so every child can achieve and thrive""."

An ornate platter of food catches the corner of my eye. ""That is a seafood tower as a welcome food amenity, as well as caviar, and you can also see the champagne there for guests to enjoy,"" says Dana Pouwels, head of airport lounge benefits at US bank Chase. She is showing me around Chase's new Sapphire Lounge at New York's La Guardia Airport. This is what waiting to catch a flight can look like these days – if you can afford to pay $550 (£433) a year to have the correct credit card required to gain entry. Then once inside Chase's new La Guardia lounge you can then choose to pay up to $3,000 to access a private suite for a few hours. It is all part of what has been described as a global arms race among the credit card companies that you are probably entirely unaware of – they are competing to outdo each other with bigger, better, bolder airport lounges. And while most of us don't have access to these lounges, experts say we are almost certainly helping pay for them. And they don't come cheap. ""Yes, it's an arms race, and they're getting extraordinary,"" says Clint Henderson, the news editor at the flight and travel website The Points Guy. ""From what we do know, we're talking up to tens of millions of dollars per lounge. ""Like the new [American Express-owned] Centurion lounge in Atlanta, I believe they spent about $100m to make that happen."" Airport lounges aren't a new concept, and credit card issuers have long teamed up with airlines to offer branded credit cards with lounge access. But now the card issuers are building lounges themselves, as a way of directly appealing to card holders - and potential new customers too. JP Morgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, they're all now in the lounge - and lifestyle - business. For American Express this includes opening a high-end lounge in midtown Manhattan. Its Centurion New York venue is located on the 55th floor of a skyscraper, with floor to ceiling windows offering sweeping views of New York, and fine dining and private bars. It's designed for Centurion card holders – a card which will cost you $10,000 as a signing on fee, plus $5,000 a year. And it is invite-only to get one. ""We're more than a credit card company or a charge card company, it's more a lifestyle brand, getting you special access to concerts, getting you into restaurants,"" says Audrey Hendley, the head of global travel at American Express. The card issuers have even moved into a 21st Century staple, the coffee shop. Capital One have Capital One Cafés - now you have a barista in a bank. Their branch in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington DC has all the classic signs of the hip coffee shop - exposed vents, bare brick walls, barista coffee machine. The only immediate giveaway you might be in the bank is the neon Capital One sign on the wall and their branded touch screens. Look a bit closer, and you might spot one of their casually dressed people who looks like a customer, but is actually what Capital One calls their ambassadors, here to welcome you in and help you with all your banking needs. Anyone can use the café, but hold a Capital One card and you get money off your brew. ""We're creating a showroom for our products,"" says Shaun Rowley the director of Capital One Cafes. ""For customers to come in and see Capital One in action, to touch it, to smell it and even taste it with our cafes. And watching them walk out, as you know, raving fans and advocates for us is kind of the return that we're looking for."" None of this sounds like the sort of language you hear normally hear from financial institutions. Dan Bennett is head of behavioural science at advertising giant Ogilvy UK. He says this is all about brands tapping into how people think about themselves, and other people. ""Yeah, it is a piece of plastic with the chip in it that holds your money, but it is something that actually gives you a position in society,"" he says. ""It is something that says something about who you are. It is something that can make you feel elevated. ""The credit card firms are not just building rooms at airports, they're building a sense of self. It's kind of amazing that financial services companies have managed to kind of look at some deep-core human drivers, and then build experiences around that. ""And that's why they're so successful with them, because they've managed to find the psychological levers to pull, rather than just looking at the world through a rational lens."" But even if you're never going to get access to these places, you are ultimately still paying for them, according to Lulu Wang. He's assistant professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago, and has studied how card payment systems work. He points out that credit cards are more expensive for merchants, be they retailers, or bars and restaurants to accept than debit cards as they incur a higher processing fee.  Prof Wang says merchants are likely to put up prices to cover the additional cost of people using credit cards. ""We typically think that corporations, you know, they're facing higher costs, they're going to pass on a pretty substantial share of those costs onto consumers,"" he explains. ""If we impose all these costs on the merchant, it ends up being a cost that is ultimately borne by all of us as consumers. Well-off people get to use the high merchant fee, high reward cards, and then it's the rest of society that has to bear that cost."" Whoever is picking up the cost, the direction of travel is clear. More lounges and lifestyle experiences are coming as card issuers compete against each other. The arms race to get your credit card loyalty isn't slowing down."

Those behind the Wentworth Woodhouse event said it would explore the stories of six ""women of substance"" who lived or worked at the property and challenged the societal norms of their time. It follows a nine-month research project completed by volunteer researchers and the staff archivist of the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust (WWPT). As well as the six women from the past, the tour now references Dame Julie Kenny, the Yorkshire businesswoman hailed as ""the champion of Wentworth Woodhouse"", who died last month aged 67.  One woman highlighted by the research team is Mary Watson-Wentworth, Marchioness of Rockingham, who lived between 1735 and 1804. She was the wife of former prime minister Charles Watson-Wentworth, but she ""was acknowledged as a skilled politician in her own right"", WWPT said. Its research uncovered other politicians would send letters directly to her, and she described herself as her husband's ""secretary"". The trust also unearthed the story of laundry maid Sarah Senegal, who had two interracial marriages in the 1700s. The research was undertaken with the help of Dig Where You Stand, an archival justice movement exploring the stories of racially marginalised people in South Yorkshire. A more recent figure is Lady Mabel Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, who helped to save the house shortly after World War Two. After issues arose about the running and maintenance of the estate, WWPT said she brokered a deal to lease most of the house and its facilities to the council's education authority. It later became Lady Mabel College, a training college for female teachers. She was also a prominent politician in South Yorkshire, with her niece describing her as a ""rabid socialist"" whose name was ""absolutely taboo"" at Wentworth.

The event was one in a series to help young female footballers to make memories, while promoting equality and inclusion in the game. Childwell Croft's first girls' football team was set up by PE teacher Tori-Ellis Willetts, a former British Army soldier and championship boxer. She said it was to help the students follow their dreams.

The project, funded by the West Midlands Violence Reduction Partnership (VRP), aims to improve the life chances of young people in inner-city Birmingham and beyond. ""It enables the students to experience other things in life, outside of the classroom and raises their aspirations, rather than them thinking they can't achieve something, or just settle for what they've got so far,"" she said. ""Football is great fun and it encourages me to stay active,"" 10-year-old Sahar said. ""We have had chances to go to so many places and try, not just football, but boxing and basketball too."" Chilwell Croft Academy has access to the state-of-the-art facilities at the Villa academy since the school joined the club's Premier League Primary Stars Programme. Danielle Beckett, schools manager for the Aston Villa Foundation, said its opening last year had been a highlight for staff and students. ""The facilities we have been able to use have given our events, beyond our core programme delivery, the wow factor and a positive lasting effect on the pupils who have taken part,"" she said.

Janet Pharaoh, who was originally from Leeds, joined the cabaret venue in 1980, before becoming its ballet mistress in 1997 and later its artistic director. The Moulin Rouge said it was ""deeply saddened"" to announce Ms Pharaoh's death. ""She has discovered, trained and accompanied thousands of artists recruited from all over the world, passing on to them her love of dance and the stage,"" it said. Born in Rothwell, Ms Pharaoh took up her passion at a Morley dance school at the age of five and spent much of her life in the French capital after being recruited by the Moulin Rouge. Founded in 1889, the venue is famed for being the birthplace of the can-can and for its colourful shows performed by dancers from around the world. It was brought to the big screen in 2001, when Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor starred in Baz Luhrmann's colourful musical Moulin Rouge! Ms Pharaoh's career took her to exotic locations across Europe, including Monte Carlo and Barcelona. Speaking to the Yorkshire Post in 2022 about her childhood, Ms Pharaoh said it was her mother who had encouraged her to be a dancer. She said: ""I didn't go to a full-time dance or stage school. ""I did my normal schooling at Rothwell Grammar School and then I'd get the bus to the Mullen Dance Academy in Leeds after school and then back home to do my homework. ""We did the same exams as those boarding schools, but in many ways it is harder as you have to get transport."" In the same interview, Ms Pharaoh rejected the idea that the Moulin Rouge had become ""outdated"", saying it had ""modernised"" but kept its historical ""essence"".  In its tribute, the Moulin Rouge said: ""Her unwavering commitment to the artists and teams around her, her kindness and her passion will leave an indelible mark on us forever. ""Her artistic team will continue her creative vision to honour her artistic legacy."" Ms Pharaoh's funeral will be held on Tuesday at the American Cathedral in Paris, the venue said.

It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China. Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported – up from zero previously. She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust. ""I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,"" she says. ""I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking."" The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation. Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April. The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances. But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions. Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.  ""US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,"" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms. ""It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer."" Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (£112bn) in 2023, according to official data. Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA. While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.  At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations. ""Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,"" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC. ""But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop."" Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the ""the vast majority"" of the new tariffs will ""probably be passed on to the consumer"" because vendors in the industry have such small margins. In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs. Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. ""There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided. ""The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans."" During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs. Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020. Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.   For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.  He plans to impose ""reciprocal tariffs"" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.   There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology. Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse. She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can ""pivot"" again. ""That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.""  "

They have all been made by female, queer, transgender and non-binary artists and scientists to mark International Women's Day. It is hoped that the event will help boost the night-time economy - 3,000 clubs, pubs and bars have closed in London since the pandemic according to the Night Time Industries Association.

Sounds of the West End, music and the heartbeats of Ms Ben Hayoun-Stépanian's family will also be heard in Piccadilly Circus but with a twist - the sounds have been sent from the square to the moon and back using Earth-Moon-Earth communication producing a ""unique astronomical soundscape"". Meanwhile, the telescopes will enable the public to view planets and nebulae, which are interstellar clouds of dust, often marking a star's birthplace. Piccadilly Un:Plugged is occurring during ""galaxy season"" when distant galaxies are at their most visible. ""Piccadilly Un:Plugged invites you to break free from the everyday and step into the extraordinary and alien aesthetics - to gaze into the cosmos, and to understand that we are only a small part of a much larger ecosystem and solar system itself,"" said Ms Ben Hayoun-Stépanian, who is also the founder of NASA's International Space Orchestra. ""Powered by an electric team of incredible scientists and female, trans, and non-binary artists, this experience reimagines the future of nightlife - on Earth and beyond. ""I'm beyond excited that everyone can now be part of it, engage their radical imagination and question what other futures could be like."" She added: ""Nightlife is a huge part of London culture but since Covid it's taken a massive hit."" ""It is out of this world,"" says Ayse Hassan, one of the musicians whose work is being sent to the moon. Having grown up in the capital city, Ms Hassan wanted to capture ""an absurd merge of London life in 2025"" that would be sent and tampered with by the moon. ""It was the perfect offering when I thought about DJing with the moon."" Ms Ben Hayoun-Stépanian hopes this exhibit can ""reflect the vibrancy of what London's night scene used to be"". In a highly digital age where many feel increasingly disconnected from the natural world, she said Piccadilly Un:Plugged invites Londoners to reflect on humanity's place in the universe. Kirsty Tullett-Jones, director of Art of London, which helped organise the event, said: ""It's a wild and imaginative experience. ""We really want to make the collaboration of art and science accessible to everyone. ""We love to surprise people with bold and boisterous art, so what better way than to bring the weird and wonderful to the West End."" One passerby told the BBC she'd ""never seen anything like it."" After closely inspecting the installation at Piccadilly Circus, she went on to add that while knowing nothing about astronomy, she was super intrigued about how the moon had changed the sound of music. Ms Ben Hayoun-Stépanian says the event is ""a message of love, compassion, healing and peace, urging a reconsideration of our futures on Earth and in space through a lens that values inclusivity, sustainability, plurality, and transnational thinking"". The After Dark exhibition, which runs from 6-8 March, was commissioned by Heart of London Business Alliance and Westminster City Council and delivered by Art of London.

Jessica Toale, Bournemouth West MP, will join a panel of local women for a discussion and walk through the town on Thursday. Safety in the town's centre was a ""huge concern"" for women, Ms Toale said. The event will see women share their experiences of the town centre and learn more about how they can better work together to improve safety. Describing the current situation, Ms Toale said: ""At best, women are having to change when and how they use the town centre and, at worst, they are avoiding it altogether."" The Labour MP, who was elected in 2024, said that although ""statistically speaking, Bournemouth is one of the safer towns in the UK"", she fully appreciated that it ""does not always feel that way"" for women. Thursday's event will see women discuss their experiences, as well as ""explore how design, culture, policing and public transport can work to make women feel safer"", Ms Toale said. ""We have a great range of speakers and it's crucial that what we learn is fed back to national government, the council and town planner networks."" Among those on the ""expert panel"" are a town planner and local night-time economy co-ordinator. The free event begins at 16:00 GMT at Patch in the town square. Those attending are required to register ahead of the event. International Women's Day takes place the day after the event, on Friday. In December last year, hundreds of people took to the streets of Bournemouth as part of a campaign calling for safer streets for women, girls and LGBTQ+ people.

Organiser Becky Carrier said the festival had ""really grown"" since it launched in 2019. The first festival had 14 events with about 700 people attending, while this year they are hoping for more than 1,200 admissions. Speaking to BBC Radio Northampton, Mrs Carrier said: ""We are about shouting about the county. ""Northamptonshire has uniqueness flowing out of us, in our history, now and in the future. ""Films are a way to shout about that."" But she added submissions for the festival were not restricted to the county - with filmmakers from around the UK taking part. As well as Delapre, the festival will be hosting events at the University of Northampton, the Northampton Filmhouse, the town's Guildhall and its own Creative Space on the Market Square. The festival also has three international Women's Day events including a women in TV and film people library, where those in attendance can have a one-on-one conversation with someone from the film industry.

SafetyNet Guernsey said it wanted to see all ""belittling"" and ""unacceptable"" behaviour outlawed. Poppy Murray, the organisation's chair, said she had heard many ""really shocking comments"" about incidents which showed that there was a ""massive misunderstanding"" about such behaviour. She said people should ""really educate"" themselves ""as a starting point"". She said some people had suggested victims of catcalling should be speaking up, ""placing the blame on them"", or that they should take it as a compliment. She said: ""All of those things show a massive misunderstanding of sexual harassment, violence against women and girls [VAWG] and the impact that it can have on women and girls - and on anyone - when this happens to them. ""I think that, as an island, we're not particularly well educated about these issues and I think that needs to change."" She urged people to ""talk to the people in your lives"" about the issue. She said: ""It is extremely likely that most of us will have someone in our life, perhaps someone extremely close to us, that has been the victim of some kind of inappropriate behaviour and never voiced that."" She also called on people to challenge behaviour.

He has signed an executive order creating what he calls a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will consist of other forms of digital currency. The funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings. White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks likened them to a ""a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency"", drawing comparison to the Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets. However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process. Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (£13.6bn) at today's prices. Speaking to reporters at the White House ahead of a special crypto summit on Friday, Sacks said that it was a ""real shame that we did not maximise value for the American taxpayer.""  ""What we want to do is make sure that with the remaining Bitcoin that we have,"" he added.  Nonetheless, Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital assets hedge fund, called Thursday's announcement ""a pig in lipstick"" in response to Sacks' post on X. ""No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the government,"" he said. Trump's executive order says that the Treasury and Commerce secretary will come up with strategies for acquiring more government Bitcoin, provided these are ""budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers"". That meant, Sacks told reporters, they are only ""allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.""  Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, agrees with the idea of a Bitcoin reserve but says the inclusion of other coins sets a ""horrible precedent"" and ""makes no sense."" ""Without a clear framework, we risk arbitrary asset selections, which would distort the markets and drive a loss of public trust,"" he suggested. Other analysts though have been more positive. ""This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""It would surely be bizarre for the US to sell dollars to buy crypto, when the dollar is the globe's reserve currency and therefore a source of enormous influence."" Further details are expected when the president speaks to the first crypto summit at the White House. It is unclear how a crypto reserve would benefit Americans, but Sacks told reporters it ""will not cost taxpayers a dime"".  It is also unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress. The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile.  His implication that the US government would not buy Bitcoin led prices of the world's largest cryptocurrency to fall by more than 5%. Some countries maintain strategic reserves of national assets to diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risk. The US also keeps a petroleum reserve. Canada has a maple syrup reserve. Earlier this week, Trump revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he said he would like included in the strategic reserve. The market prices of the five coins he named - Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano - swiftly jumped after that announcement. Mr Yanowitz said the US government needed to be wary of being seen to pick winners. ""Ensuring transparency through independent audits and public reporting is crucial for fostering innovation instead of favouritism,"" he said. Additionally, Sacks said that each government department - including the intelligence agencies - will have to audit and ""self-report"" their own cryptocurrency holdings. No exceptions have so far been made.  ""We'll take in that report, and then the Secretary of the Treasury will be setting up accounts within the charging department, one for Bitcoin and one for all other digital assets,"" he said.  Trump aggressively courted the crypto community during his presidential campaign. Former US President Joe Biden led a crackdown on crypto, citing concerns about fraud.

Kate Wright, from the charity Freeda [Free from Domestic Abuse], was speaking as the charity hosted a breakfast in Jersey ahead of International Women's Day. She said: ""Perpetrators continue to find new ways to commit their crimes, particularly online... so this is not a one-off project. This goes on forever."" At last year's event, Chief Minister Lyndon Farnham announced that he would be accepting all of the recommendations made in a report on violence against women and girls. The UN theme for this year's event is: For ALL women and girls: Rights Equality & Empowerment.  Community and business leaders from Jersey and the UK have been talking about the challenges many women face and how difficult it could be, especially for women in minority communities, to make their voices heard. Solicitor Harriet Wistrich, who helped bring a case against the London Metropolitan Police for their failures to investigate allegations against convicted taxi driver John Worboys, told BBC Radio Jersey, for many of the women involved, it was almost worse that police had not believed them. She said: ""Many, many women who had not reported him - because they did not think they would be believed - then came forward and it transpired that over 105 came forward to say they had been the victim of rape or serious sexual assault by this taxi driver. ""Had the police acted effectively at the beginning, had they pursued him, many of those women would never have been raped or sexually assaulted... in the first place."" There is hope that Jersey's government is taking the problem of domestic abuse seriously and that women, particularly in minority communities are finding their voice. Lesley Katsande, from Friends of Africa, said: ""Lets wait and see. The chief minister himself and the minister for home affairs, they did say they heard us, so, hopefully, they are going to go away and think about it and... implement those changes.

Research in 2024 showed 47% of people said when it comes to giving women equal rights with men ""things have gone far enough in Great Britain"". Johanna Robinson, Welsh government advisor on violence against women and girls, said of those she speaks to ""a significant proportion of men think gender equality has gone too far"".  She added although there had been progression and positive change, it had also created anger in some men. A panel of Welsh women spoke to BBC Walescast to mark International Women's Day, which falls on 8 March. For more than a century, people around the world have marked International Women's Day. The idea to make it an international event came from Clara Zetkin, a communist activist and advocate for women's rights. However, despite acknowledging successes and changes, Welsh women have raised concerns that equality is regressing. Johanna has spoken out previously about her own experience as a survivor. ""When I speak to young women I am horrified of their experiences, that actually they're no safer than I was at their age,"" she said. ""One of the things for me that really demonstrates this is speaking to young women about their day to day experiences - like gym culture, and that they choose safe spots or safe times."" She said despite the progression made, it had created anger in some men.  ""In some ways you see that fuelling men, that women are improving and they now feel that gender equality has gone too far."" Helen Molyneux is a lawyer and founder of the Monumental Welsh Women Project - a project to help provide statues of real Welsh women in Wales. ""I worry that there's this push back against women's rights,"" she said. ""There's almost a bit of hysteria around facts like there are more women doctors than men now or that women are earning slightly more than men in certain age groups."" She said attitudes in places like the US and Afghanistan meant women there ""have less rights now than their mothers and grandmothers"". Sian James played a key role in the support networks surrounding the 1984 miner's strike. Women played a vital role in the dispute, organising food collections, distributions and fundraising, organising pickets and speaking at rallies. Sian was one of many women to join support groups in south Wales, and said the women were ""better organisers"". ""I come from a long line of chopsy women, I'm not ashamed to say that. Chopsy women change the world. ""Suddenly in '84, women really were at the forefront, it's very empowering, very liberating."" But while she acknowledges there have been changes in women's equality, she is concerned it is not enough. ""I am really tired of people telling me to stop being woke.  ""It's not, it's basic human rights and I'm going to keep fighting for them as long as I possibly can."" Research from the World Economic Forum found at the current rate of progress it would take until 2158 to reach full parity - which is roughly five generations from now. All three women could give examples of times in their careers where they had been made to feel uncomfortable because they were women. Sian became a Labour MP for Swansea East in 2005, and told BBC Wales about an interaction that happened to her in Westminster. ""I had a big brooch on and somebody said 'oh [you] won first prize in the heifer class have you, at the local agricultural fair'.  ""That was a member of parliament that said that to me."" Johanna said: ""I got harassed in my first job when I was washing pots, and then I got harassed later on in life as well."" Johanna spoke of when she was harassed at a football match. She said a man sitting behind her repeatedly grabbed her after she had told him to stop. Helen described a time as a young solicitor when she was called a witch. ""I was accused of organising a coven because I invited three other female solicitors out for lunch,"" she said. She also said she was horrified telling her daughter about some of her experiences. ""I'm embarrassed to say that I would tell my daughter stories of things that happened and [laugh], because at the time, it was just what you put up with if you wanted to fit in and get on."" All three women highlighted the importance of education to ensure men are part of the solution to tackling gender inequality."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x4vj8rj9wo","China targets 5% growth as it reels from Trump tariffs",2025-03-05,"Peter Hoskins and Kelly Ng","BBC News","China has set an economic growth target for this year of ""around 5%"" and pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy, which is now facing a trade war with the US. Its leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors. But the week-long gathering is closely watched for clues on Beijing's policy changes - and this year is more significant than most. President Xi Jinping had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment, before Donald Trump's new 10% levy on Chinese imports came into effect on Tuesday. This follows the 10% tariff imposed in early February, taking the total US levy to 20%. And it hits what has been a rare bright spot for the Chinese economy: exports.  Beijing hit back almost immediately on Tuesday, just as it did last month. It announced retaliatory action that included 10%-15% tariffs on certain agriculture imports from the US. This is key because China is the biggest market for these goods, such as American corn, wheat and soybeans. At the opening of this week's meeting, known as Two Sessions, China vowed to make domestic demand the ""main engine and anchor"" of its economic growth. Beijing was able to meet its 5% target for the last two years but growth was driven by strong exports, which resulted in a nearly trillion-dollar record trade surplus.  Repeating that is going to be much harder this year.  ""If the tariffs linger, Chinese exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third,"" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China economics at Moody's Analytics.  Beijing is going to have to rely more than ever on domestic spending to achieve 5% growth - but that has been one of its biggest challenges.  On Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said consumption has been sluggish and pledged to ""vigorously boost"" household demand. ""Domestically, the foundation for China's sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough."" ""Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,"" Li said, as he noted the rise of protectionism around the world. Beijing has already rolled out schemes to encourage its people to spend more, including allowing them to trade in and replace consumer goods like kitchen appliances, cars, phones and electronic devices.  The government now aims to put more money into ordinary Chinese people's pockets and help cut the country's reliance on exports and investment. Beijing's plans include issuing 1.3 trillion yuan ($179bn; £140bn) in special treasury bonds this year to help fund its stimulus measures. Local governments will also be allowed to increase the amount of money they borrow to 4.4 trillion yuan, up from 3.9 trillion yuan, according to the annual ""Work Report"".  In a rare move, Beijing raised its fiscal deficit - the difference between the government's spending and revenue - by one percentage point to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the highest level in decades. The hike signals Beijing's commitment to increase spending to shore up growth. It has long sought to keep the deficit at or below 3% of GDP to demonstrate fiscal discipline.  It also announced plans to create more than 12 million jobs in cities, setting a target for urban unemployment at around 5.5% for 2025. The figure stood at 5.1% last year. The government also pledged to provide more support to high-tech industries, restore stability in the property market, and expand elderly care programmes for its ageing population. Whether these measures will be enough to boost consumption is the key question. Harsh pandemic-era restrictions along with a prolonged real estate crisis and a government crackdown on tech and finance companies have fuelled pessimism among Chinese people. And a weak social safety net means savings have become especially crucial in case of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.    But China's leadership is optimistic. CPCC spokesman Liu Jieyi told reporters ahead of the session that while the economy was facing challenges such as low demand, it was ""important to recognise that China's economic fundamentals are stable, there are many advantages, resilience is strong, and potential is significant"". Investment in what President Xi calls ""high-quality development"", which covers high-tech industries from renewables to artificial intelligence (AI), is also expected to be a major focus. The world's second-largest economy, China has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West. State media has already touted recent examples like DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics, both of which have caught global attention, as examples of China's ""technological progress"".  The success of DeepSeek in particular saw an AI-driven stock rally, with analysts noting renewed interest in China among foreign investors.  A commentary in the state-run Xinhua newspaper said ""China's new energy industries and overall green transition, driven by its cutting-edge technologies, will continue to be important growth drivers"".  But the new US levies - which come on top of tariffs from Trump's first term - could  stymie these plans, not least because they could dampen investor sentiment. ""The chaos that tariffs leave in their wake is kryptonite for investment,"" Mr Murphy Cruise says. ""Tariffs are set to deliver a one-two punch to China's economy, landing blows to both exports and investment."" Also on Wednesday, China announced a 7.2% increase in its national defence budget, the same rate of growth as last year. Additional reporting by João da Silva"

The price being paid for Walgreens Boots Alliance is a fraction of what the company was worth a decade ago, reflecting its struggles with growing debt and shoppers going online for cheaper products.  There have been reports that the Boots chain could be sold off separately by its new owner, US private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Walgreens chief executive Tim Wentworth said the firm was navigating the ""challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape"". ""While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company,"" he added. George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBC's Today programme that Boots had been ""in and out of different ownership for some time"" and that ""its business model has struggled"". ""People are buying more of those personal healthcare brands online than they are in the shop."" Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Savvy Marketing, said there would be ""a lot of interested parties"" if the Boots business was put up for sale. She said the company had turned itself around after going through a difficult period and it was an ""unbelievably trusted brand"" with ""a unique place in the UK psyche"". There are now 1,900 Boots stores left in the UK after the pharmacy chain began closing shops in June 2023 as part of a shake up. Ms Shuttleworth said reports of a Boots sale would be difficult for staff. ""Any uncertainty over your ownership is going to make you quite concerned if you work for Boots."" Boots has been contacted for comment. Sycamore Partners is paying $11.45 per share for Walgreens Boots Alliance, which is more than its shares are currently worth on the US stock market. Walgreens shares rose by nearly 6% in extended trading in New York. But the company's stock market value has fallen by around 80% over the past five years. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The Illinois-based Walgreens took a 45% stake in Boots in 2012. It bought the remainder of the firm two years later in a deal that valued Boots at around £9bn. Walgreens is also made up of its namesake US retail business, specialty pharmacy group Shields Health Solutions and healthcare provider VillageMD. In recent years, the company has faced mounting challenges as customers turned to cheaper rivals. In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale but later dropped these plans, saying potential buyers had been unable to raise enough funds. In October, it announced plans to shut 1,200 Walgreens stores in the US over the next three years under a cost-cutting programme."

""We've been working on this agreement since I started as director last Autumn and it was crystal-clear from day one that people across Scotland wanted to see their national team back live on free-to-air television."" Matches will be shown on BBC One Scotland and BBC iPlayer - with key fixtures also being broadcast across the UK - and adds to existing live international coverage on BBC Radio Scotland and the BBC Sport app.  Scottish FA chief executive Ian Maxwell is ""delighted"" that the men's national team would be televised on a free-to-air basis on the BBC. ""It complements their existing coverage of the Scotland women's national team and, beyond that, their overall commitment to the domestic game in this country,"" he said. ""We thank Viaplay for their support to this point. When it became apparent the rights could become available, we championed the potential for free-to-air coverage to reach as many Scotland supporters as possible and we are grateful that BBC and Uefa could reach agreement."" The deal adds to the BBC's extensive football coverage of the Scottish Professional Football League, Scottish Cup and Scottish Championship across television, radio and online. Across the three nations, the deal includes 41 live matches over the next 15 months."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45zwe0v0ro","Deep-sea mining tech advances but doubts remain",2025-03-07,"Chris Baraniuk","Technology Reporter","There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed. All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat. The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean. Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts. ""We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,"" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals. The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says. The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses – they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance. Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however. ""Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,"" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF. Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. ""If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,"" says John Childs at Lancaster University. ""That's been the widespread position from science [to date]."" Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using older, highly disruptive technologies, have been severe. In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later. Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies. Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019. Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition. Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact. No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July. Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws. He adds that ""hundreds"" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land. Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara. He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: ""Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining."" Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology ""in sync"" with the environment. Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process. ""You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,"" says managing director Bård Brekke Jørgensen. ""You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool."" The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique. Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says ""there's absolutely nothing in it"". Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are ""virtue signalling"" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company. ""We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,"" says Mr Barron. The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities. Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface. Trials of the system in 2022 retrieved more than 3,000 tonnes of nodules, The Metals Company says. The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time. Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were ""total nonsense"", says Mr Barron. Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance. Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact. Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. ""If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,"" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind. Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem. Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests. And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics. ""When you delve deeper into it, and you look at which minerals actually have supply shortages, I'm not sure that adds up,"" she says."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cx2x01728x4o",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Steve Smith has retired from one-day international cricket following Australia's semi-final exit from the Champions Trophy. The 35-year-old made 170 appearances for Australia in his 50-over career, hitting 12 centuries and winning the ODI World Cup in 2015 and 2023.  Smith captained the side in Pat Cummins' absence during his final ODI appearance on Tuesday, when Australia suffered a four-wicket loss to India in Dubai in the Champions Trophy.  The former Sussex batsman will remain available for Test and T20 selection for his country.  ""There have been so many amazing times and wonderful memories. Winning two World Cups was a great highlight along with the many fantastic team-mates who shared the journey,"" said Smith, Australian men's ODI player of the year in 2015 and 2021.  ""Now is a great opportunity for people to start preparing for the 2027 ODI World Cup so it feels like the right time to make way. ""Test cricket remains a priority and I am really looking forward to the World Test Championship final, the West Indies in the winter and then England at home. I feel I still have a lot to contribute on that stage."" Smith hit the winning boundary as Australia beat New Zealand in the 2015 ODI World Cup final at the MCG. He also played a key role eight years later as Australia upset hots India to win the tournament for a sixth time. Smith finishes his ODI career with 5,800 runs, at an average of 43.28.  His highest score of 164 came against New Zealand at the SCG in 2016.  Matthew Henry, BBC Sport journalist in Dubai Smith gave no hint at retirement in his news conference after defeat by India, but this decision is no surprise. He will be 38 by the time the next 50-over World Cup comes around in 2027. He will go down as one of the great cricketers of his era, although still probably more for his Test exploits despite being a two-time World Cup winner. A recent resurgence in red-ball cricket suggests he can continue there for a few years yet, beyond this winter's Ashes against England. This retirement will give an early hint at the future of the Australia after their current crop - Mitchell Starc, Glenn Maxwell and Josh Hazlewood are 34 or older - move on. Expect 21-year-old Cooper Connolly, who came in against India after injury to Matt Short, to be given opportunities."

Staff and students at the university are being encouraged to dedicate a plaque to a woman at the university who has inspired or supported them. The plaques are being displayed at the library on the Claverton Down campus this week as part of celebrations for International Women's Day on Saturday. It is the idea of Prof Turi King, director of the Milner Centre for Evolution at the university, who described them as ""little acts of kindness"". ""It's an event I ran at my previous university and I know from experience that it is such a great feel-good celebration of women at the university,"" said Prof King. ""It's one of these really heart-warming things because people see the plaques that are dedicated to them and some people are in tears."" Pens and plaques are available in the library for staff and students to write down who they appreciate and why. The nominated women will receive an e-mail to say they have been recognised on the wall. The women can collect their plaques at the end of the week. ""Every woman who has a plaque dedicated to them will be emailed to let them know, and the week after the event staff will be able to come and collect their plaque,"" continued Prof King. Dr Marianne Harkins, director of the faculty technical services, said: ""It was lovely to find out that someone had written a plaque for me, but also to have the chance to read the amazing plaques for other women here at the university."" ""I love seeing them above people's desks in the months that follow, reminding them just how great they are,"" said Prof King.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjyxljyjxno","Sweden is 'no longer a country that cannot be trusted'",2025-03-06,"Jorn Madslien","Business reporter","War, cross-border conflict and geopolitical upheaval are rarely deemed good for business. Yet that appears to have been the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on two of the aggressor's neighbours to its west – Finland and Sweden. Not directly, of course. Rather, it was the two Nordic nations' response to the invasion that turned fear into hope. Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion. Less than three years later, they're both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics. ""We're no longer a country that cannot be trusted,"" observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nation's previous historic neutrality. He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Nato's ordering from defence firms. Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into what's going on inside the alliance. ""We couldn't access NSPAs before,"" he says. Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. ""Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond."" Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending. Presently, only 23 of the organisation's 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2% of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance. Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA. Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years. Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europe's northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland. Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finland's, Sweden's, Norway's and Denmark's 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence. In addition, substantial investments will be required to replenish stockpiles of advanced weapons systems, including missiles and anti-tank systems, Mr Johansson points out. And while the White House this week announced a pause in US military aid to Ukraine, European leaders have declared they're in it for the long haul, so here too we can expect substantial and ongoing spending on arms. Aerial surveillance programmes and underwater systems are also increasingly in demand as the returning tension between Russia and the West brings a new chill to the Arctic region. In these areas Saab's boss is eager to promote its own solutions, such as the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control platform, and its Sea Wasp, a remotely-controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralise explosive devices. Yet given Donald Trump's strong emphasis on ""America first"", it is unlikely that he will be happy with European Nato members choosing Saab, or indeed any other European defence firm over US rivals. Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with its obvious need to retain American support. European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries. In a sense, then, the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight. ""Europe's Trans-Atlantic relationship will always remain important,"" says Mr Johansson, though he also points to a ""growing realisation in Europe that we have to do more on our own"". ""The US really protects its own defence industry, and we should do the same in Europe,"" he says, as he welcomes ""fierce competition"" between commercial defence companies. Much of this competition may be between relative newcomers to the defence industry, however. Finnish government agency Business Finland has published a guidebook that offers advice to companies on how to do business with Nato. Its authors predict that the armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic will have ""significant new needs for services and equipment, both hi-tech and low-tech"".  Many of these needs will need to be met by start-ups and established small to medium-sized companies, says the guide, rather than exclusively by large, established defence companies. Johan Sjöberg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because ""the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed"". Mr Sjöberg adds that he favours a ""holistic view, that security is good for business, as increased security and stability provide long-term credibility"". In Finland too, Nato membership has created new opportunities, especially for the plethora of small and medium-sized companies that Ambassador Siukosaari refer to as ""Nokia-spin-offs"". These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland ""drone wall"" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia. Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables. But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's ""Total Defence"" concept. Also applied by Norway and Denmark, it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony, energy generation and distribution, road networks, and secure supplies of food, medicine as parts of a total defence system. Much of this may not be registered as defence spending in the statistics, but at the same time, none of it is free. Beyond the civilian infrastructure spending, national military service, for instance, sometimes takes people away from the economically productive parts of the economy, Ambassador Siukosaari points out. But perhaps what they deliver does more for the nation than mere provision of products and services? Nato's newest members believe they could teach other allied countries a thing or two about defence. They clearly offer new perspectives both on how defence spending should be measured. And perhaps also on how civilian society and private enterprise can play their parts."

The ""state-sponsored"" operation also targeted government agencies including the Treasury, according to the Justice Department (DOJ). Hackers also allegedly targeted an American religious organisation, and a newspaper in Hong Kong, the statement added. China has not responded to these specific allegations, but have strongly denied other accusations in the past.   In December, the Treasury Department reported a ""major"" breach by Chinese -sponsored hackers, saying they were able to access employee workstations and some unclassified documents.  At that time, China denied any involvement, calling the accusation ""baseless"" and saying it ""consistently opposes all forms of hacking"".  It is unclear when the latest DOJ charges were issued - but they were unsealed in a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday.  Among the individuals charged were two officers of China's Ministry of Public Security. The DOJ said that hackers, which appeared to represent a private company, i-Soon, charged Chinese agencies between $10,000 and $75,000 for each ""exploited"" email inbox.   They allegedly ""conducted computer intrusions"" under the direction of Chinese ministries and on their own initiative, and were ""paid handsomely for stolen data"". ""Today, we are exposing the Chinese government agents directing and fostering indiscriminate and reckless attacks against computers and networks worldwide,"" said Sue J Bai, who heads the DOJ's National Security Division. ""We will continue to fight to dismantle this ecosystem of cyber mercenaries and protect our national security,"" she added.  No further details on the targeted US-based dissidents were provided. The religious organisation hit by hackers was described as one which ""previously sent missionaries to China and was openly critical of the PRC government"". PRC is short for the People's Republic of China. A Hong Kong newspaper was also on the list. While it was not named, the statement said that it was ""considered as being opposed to the PRC government"".  Besides US agencies, hackers were said to have targeted the foreign ministries of Taiwan, India, South Korea and Indonesia. Last October, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said hacks targeting two major US presidential campaigns were carried out by ""actors affiliated with the People's Republic of China"". Earlier last year, seven Chinese nationals were charged with running a hacking operation that lasted at least 14 years and targeted foreign critics of China. Operations linked by Western governments to China have also targeted the UK's Electoral Commission, and the UK and New Zealand parliaments. As part of its long-running rewards programme, the US State Department said it was offering up to $10m for information on i-Soon, its employees and Chinese officials ""engaged in malicious cyber activities highlighted in the Department of Justice's indictments""."

On Monday, the bubble tea chain's shares jumped by more than 40% in their Hong Kong Stock Exchange debut. The company raised $444m (£352m) in the financial hub's biggest initial public offering (IPO) of the year. Mixue's popularity comes as many people in China are grappling with the country's economic challenges - including a property crisis, and weak consumer and business confidence. It sells ice creams and drinks for an average of six Chinese yuan ($0.82; £0.65). The company was founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao, a student at Henan University of Finance and Economics, as a part time job to help his family's finances. Its full name Mìxuě Bīngchéng means ""honey snow ice city"", with its stores adorned with its Snow King mascot and playing the firm's official theme tune on a loop. According to Mixue, it has more than 45,000 stores across China and 11 other countries, including Singapore and Thailand. The firm has also said it plans to continue expanding. That compares to ""over 43,000 locations"" for McDonald's and Starbucks' 40,576 outlets. While it is often seen as China's biggest bubble tea, iced drinks, and ice cream chain, it operates more like a raw-materials supplier than a traditional brand. Unlike Starbucks, which operates more than half of its stores directly, almost all of Mixue's outlets are run by franchisees. Mixue's strong market debut contrasts with smaller rival Guming, which saw shares slide on its first day of trading in February. Last year, shares in the owner of bubble tea chain Chabaidao also fell on their market debut. "

Olympic bronze medallist Hunter Bell will line up as the fastest European woman over 1500m this year and, while another podium place is her priority, Laura Muir's British indoor record time of 3:59.58 is also in her sights. ""I would love to run a fast time and I do have half an eye on the British record,"" Hunter Bell, who races in the heats during Thursday's opening session, told BBC Sport. ""But championship racing is about the podium, not the time, so we will see if the opportunity presents itself this weekend to run fast."" Elsewhere, Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen will bid to make history by taking his tally of European indoor golds to seven with a third consecutive 1500m and 3,000m double at the championships. Great Britain finished third in the medal table with three golds and six medals overall in 2023, but title-winners Keely Hodgkinson, Laura Muir and Jazmin Sawyers are all absent from the 42-strong squad. Another British medal hope, world indoor pole vault champion Molly Caudery, has withdrawn to focus on the World Indoor Championships later this month as she manages a minor calf problem. The championships will feature wavelight technology - the LED pacing system on the inside of the track - for the first time after European Athletics approved its use in a competitive setting, although organisers said ""it will not be used as a direct aid to athletes"". Follow coverage of the European Indoor Championships on BBC Two from Thursday 6 to Sunday, 9 March. Few could have foreseen Hunter Bell's rapid rise to the Olympic podium even just 12 months ago. Now a full-time athlete after taking a sabbatical from her cyber security job to chase her Olympic dream last summer, the 31-year-old is targeting her first international gold. Hunter Bell set a British record time of three minutes 52.61 seconds in winning a brilliant 1500m bronze at Paris 2024, two months after she secured her first international medal at the outdoor European Championships in Rome. Having achieved victory over the mile at the prestigious Millrose Games in New York and retained her British indoor 1500m title in a promising start to 2025, her season's best of 4:00.63 is almost three seconds faster than any of her competitors in Apeldoorn. ""Last year I was very much the underdog, this year I'm going into competitions expected to win, which is a big mental adjustment,"" said Hunter Bell, who trains alongside Olympic 800m champion Hodgkinson under coaches Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows. ""It's something Keely adjusted to last year and really worked hard on. I speak to her about it to get some advice and hopefully I will develop that."" George Mills and Melissa Courtney-Bryant both also go into their respective 3,000m events with leading times this year. Mills, the son of former England international footballer Danny Mills, broke the British indoor 3,000m record in a time of 7:27.92 in February but will face tough competition from two-time champion Ingebrigtsen - as will fellow Briton Neil Gourley over 1500m. Two-time European indoor 3,000m bronze medallist Courtney-Bryant clocked 8:28.69 to win in Boston in February and is joined by 18-year-old senior debutant Innes FitzGerald, who recently smashed the European indoor U20 record in 8:40.05. The British team also features Olympic 400m finalist Amber Anning, while 2022 European 100m bronze medallist Jeremiah Azu and Olympic women's 4x100m relay silver medallists Bianca Williams and Amy Hunt each compete over 60m. Ingebrigtsen will aim to complete a remarkable triple-double in the 1500m and 3,000m, a feat which would see him match Valeriy Borzov's men's record of seven European indoor titles. The 24-year-old, already a seven-time global medallist, repeated his Torun 2021 golden double in Istanbul two years ago, having captured 3,000m gold and 1500m silver as an 18-year-old in 2019.  The Olympic 5,000m champion appears in the form to achieve that again, breaking his world indoor 1500m record (3:29.63) while setting the world indoor mile record (3:45.14) last month. But Britons Gourley, 1500m silver medallist in 2023, and Mills, winner of European 5,000m silver last year, will hope to challenge Ingebrigtsen in their respective finals on Friday and Sunday.  While Femke Bol has chosen not to compete in any individual events at her home championships, the 25-year-old Dutch star will look to anchor the host nation to medals in both the mixed and women's 4x400m relays - the first and last events of the four-day championship. Nine years after working as a volunteer ticket scanner when Amsterdam hosted the 2016 European Championships, Bol will represent her nation as a 12-time medallist at major global championships following her three Olympic medals at Paris 2024.

Afghanistan left-arm wrist-spinner Noor Ahmad has the highest reserve price at £200,000. In the women's draft, India wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh is available after stints with London Spirit and Birmingham Phoenix in the past two years. After taking a break from cricket to ""prioritise her well-being"", New Zealand captain Sophie Devine is also on the international draft list that includes Sri Lanka star Chamari Athapaththu and Australia seamer Kim Garth. England men's and women's players such as Rehan Ahmed, Sophia Dunkley, Jamie Overton, Reece Topley and Issy Wong are among the domestic potential draftees. They feature alongside England legend James Anderson and young Lancashire batter Rocky Flintoff, son of former England all-rounder Andrew. The Hundred begins on 5 August with a London derby double-header between London Spirit and Oval Invincibles at Lord's."

The possibility of a rollback, which he said could be announced on Wednesday, came as many US businesses raised concerns about Trump's decision to hit US imports from its two closest trade partners with a 25% import tax.  After two days of declines, the main US stock indexes were trading slightly higher early on Wednesday.  Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Mélanie Joly told the BBC's Newsnight on Tuesday that her office had not been contacted about any plans around reducing tariffs. US officials ""can say many things"" but ""the only one that really takes a decision is President Trump,"" Joly said. The US president used a large part of his speech to Congress on Tuesday to outline his trade policies, but he did not say whether he planned to cut the tariffs that came into effect this week. Canada and Mexico announced retaliatory import levies on the US after Washington's 25% tariffs on its two neighbours came into effect on Tuesday. Goods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated. Trump says he wants to protect American industry and boost manufacturing, but many economists warn such tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US. On Wednesday, Lutnick said tariffs would be in place, but suggested some goods could be ""left out"". ""There are going to be tariffs - let's be clear - but what he's thinking about is which sections of the market that maybe he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2,"" Lutnick told Bloomberg on Wednesday.  ""It will be 25% but there will be some categories left out - it could well be autos. It could be others as well,"" he added. A day earlier on Fox News, Lutnick had raised the possibility of a compromise and reduction of tariffs for Mexico and Canada, saying Trump was weighing offers to meet his allies ""in the middle"".  Trump has said he would move ahead on 2 April with plans for reciprocal tariffs on other countries around the world that he sees as treating the US unfairly. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has slammed Trump's sweeping tariffs on his country, calling it a ""very dumb thing to do"" and vowed to conduct a ""relentless fight"" to protect its economy. Trudeau announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries. But Trump pushed even further in a post on his Truth Social platform, saying: ""Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!"" Trudeau accused the US president of planning ""a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us"". ""That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state,"" he told reporters. Washington also ramped up its trade war with Beijing on Tuesday as a new 10% levy on Chinese imports that came into effect - which adds to existing levies from Trump's first term and those announced last month. ""China will fight to the bitter end of any trade war,"" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said after their country announced tit-for-tat tariffs on agricultural imports from the US."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cz61341xv0jo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidential candidate Kirsty Coventry says it's time the organisation was led by a woman - but wants members ""to have confidence in me that I'm the right person"". The 41-year-old former swimmer would also become the youngest - and the first from outside Europe or North America - to lead the organisation in its 130-year history if she beats her six male rivals in a vote later this month. ""I don't think it's just about gender, the same way that I don't think it's just about being the only African candidate,"" the Zimbabwean sports minister told BBC Sport. ""It really is about, 'what does the movement need today'? ""I think being a double Olympic champion and having the experiences that I've had within our movement and outside, all bring a lot of value to ensuring I could lead this organisation."" Coventry, who won the 200m backstroke at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics and is Africa's most-decorated Olympian, is ""very positive"" about her chances of becoming sport's most powerful figure when IOC members make their choice in Greece on 20 March. When asked how she felt about being seen as the preferred choice of outgoing president Thomas Bach after his 12-year tenure, Coventry added: ""He's allowed the candidates to do what we need to do and talk to the members and it's [their] decision. He's been fair to all of the candidates."" Coventry wants to ""try to challenge the status quo and to bring change"". ""Being able to showcase the biggest and most wonderful sports event in the world, where you have athletes from all different backgrounds coming together…that for me is what the world needs right now,"" she added. ""We have to make very good decisions so that this movement can remain relevant for generations to come. And, for me, being a mum of two young girls, I feel the weight on my shoulders is maybe a little bit more than that of the other candidates because I'm going have a constant reminder that I need to not mess this up."" The IOC currently allows each international federation (IF) to set its own gender eligibility rules, and in recent years a number have barred athletes who have undergone male puberty from competing in elite female competition, amid concerns inclusion may come at the expense of fairness and safety.  Coventry has been an IOC executive board member since 2023, but confirmed that - as with rival presidential candidate Lord Coe - she is now backing a blanket ban of transgender women from competing in female Olympic sport. ""I believe with the work that has been done with the IFs, the rules they have put in place, you can see there has been research done where it's showing a disadvantage to women, to the female category"" she said. ""From the conversations that I've had now, a lot of the international federations want the IOC to take a more leadership role. We have more facts, there's more science and medical research being done. ""We need to protect the female category and I think it's time right now for the IOC to take that leading role."" The IOC was engulfed in controversy at the Paris Games last summer when Algeria's Imane Khelif won the women's welterweight boxing gold medal - a year after being disqualified from the World Championships for reportedly failing a gender eligibility test.  The IOC cleared the 25-year-old to compete - along with Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, who was also banned by the suspended International Boxing Association (IBA). Both fighters have insisted they are women, and there is no suggestion they are transgender. When asked if she and her IOC colleagues could have avoided the episode, Coventry added: ""There are always lessons we can learn. There are always going to be things we can't foresee, but we should do the best to ensure something like that doesn't play out again at an Olympic Games."" Coventry has faced criticism in Zimbabwe in her capacity as sports minister since 2018, but defended her association with the government of controversial president Emmerson Mnangagwa.  In 2022 Fifa banned Zimbabwe from international football over governmental interference in the running of the game. Last year the United States also imposed sanctions on Mnangagwa and other senior officials for corruption and human rights abuses. Zimbabwe's government condemned the decision. ""I don't believe you can really create change if you don't have a seat at the table"" said Coventry. ""It's not been the easiest thing but I have had incredible support and we are making a difference. Our sports are starting to do much better. With change it takes time, but I am someone that doesn't want to stand on the side.  ""Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't, but I want to be able to try. I'm going to make my country better. ""Having to navigate very sensitive issues has definitely given me extra 'armour' if I can put it that way for what [the IOC] will face in in the future, and we're going to have to navigate difficult leaders that have different opinions on things. But what will help us to navigate that is to not verge away from our Olympic charter, our values."" The other six candidates for the IOC presidency are France's David Lappartient, Japan's Morinari Watanabe, Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan, Spaniard Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, Swede Johan Eliasch and the UK's Lord Sebastian Coe."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w51kg8ldo","Why detecting methane is difficult but crucial work",2025-03-04,"Christine Ro","Technology Reporter","In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is. They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies. But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen. Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes. A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma. Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation. ""It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,"" Ms Bah says. Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas. While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation. Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture. But methane is not always easy to notice. It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light. Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful. ""There is no perfect solution,"" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative. There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities. Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says. At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms. Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions. He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view. With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs. Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges. Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover. ""In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,"" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible. Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November. It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding. Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024. With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, ""What was previously unseeable is now visible,"" Mr Duren says. ""As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint."" It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using ""enclosed combustors"" to obscure gas flaring. Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well. For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes. In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts. Because there are so many locations to be monitored, ""this saves us a lot of time,"" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS. In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses. However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback. And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. ""I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year."" At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. ""Now that we know better, we can do better,"" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwwgl2nleo","Is the UK becoming less attractive for students?",2025-03-04,"Simon Gilbert and Alix Hattenstone","BBC News","The UK has been one of the most popular destinations for international students in recent years - but is its appeal starting to fade? Home Office figures show UK sponsored study visas dropped by 31% – from 600,024 in 2023 to 415,103 in 2024 - and with this, money many university cities rely on. Universities UK, which represents 141 institutions, says measures to reduce net migration have ""created significant uncertainty around the UK's post-study work offer"". The government says international students ""will always be welcome but the net migration levels seen in recent years have been completely unacceptable, and we have committed to reducing those numbers substantially"". Coventry in the West Midlands is particularly dependent on the international student economy.  In 2022-23, of universities with at least 10,000 students, Coventry University had the second highest percentage of international students in England outside London. There were 16,285 non-UK students out of a total of 35,405, according to the most recent figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). Jingwen Yuan, 30, spent seven years as a construction project manager in her native China, where she oversaw building projects that housed more people than are found in some UK cities.  The Coventry University alumnus has a masters degree in advanced engineering management and paid £3,000 to stay in the UK on a graduate visa while looking for work - but has been unable to find a job. ""All of my bachelor degrees classmates from home have gone back to China,"" she says. ""My friend got £5,000 to £6,000 from our government if she came back. And for us, if we choose to stay, we need to pay £3,000 to the UK government. Can you see the difference?"" ""The one thing stopping more students coming here is recent changes in the visa,"" says Mohammed Abdullah Sayyed, 21, from India.  Student visa restrictions took effect in January 2024, meaning postgraduates lost the right to bring dependant family members to the UK and new students were prevented from switching to a work visa before the end of their courses. There was an 85% drop in the number of sponsored study visas for dependants, from 143,276 in 2023 to 21,978 in 2024. Mohammed says another factor is international students pay more than UK ones. Coventry University says tuition fees can vary depending on the course - but as of September 2024, most courses cost approximately £16,800 – £20,050 per year for international students.  That's compared to £9,250 for domestic students, which will rise to £9,535 in September. Coventry University says Brexit has had ""a profound impact"" on UK universities' ability to attract EU students.  The House of Commons Library states the number of EU students fell sharply after changes to visa requirements and funding rules in 2021-22.  Since August 2021, new students from the EU generally have had to pay international fees and do not qualify for tuition fee loans. Laura Alonso is studying international relations at Coventry University.  The 21-year-old from Spain says: ""There's a lot of international people and international students, especially in Coventry, so you always feel welcome"". But she believes the UK's withdrawal from the Erasmus+ programme put lots of Spanish students off studying there.  The Turing Scheme, which replaced it, funds UK participants to study or work abroad - but does not fund international students coming to the UK.  Whilst the number of international visas has fallen by almost a third, the number of international students applying to study in the UK via The University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) has increased. UCAS saw a 2.7% rise in international undergraduate applicants between 2024 and 2025 However this does not represent the full picture, as UCAS figures do not account for students applying directly through colleges and universities, or postgraduate courses. The overall fall in international students is impacting Coventry University's finances. It recently put hundreds of staff at risk of redundancy. So it is little surprise the change is also being felt in the city's wider economy. Coventry University's analysis of Higher Education Policy Institute and Kaplan International's figures suggests international students generate about £651m a year for the city's economy. One sign of a drop in overseas students is that several purpose-built student accommodation blocks are the subject of change-of-use planning proposals to convert them for residential use. The volume of student accommodation being approved has attracted debate, with some residents objecting to planning applications.  Estate agents report landlords selling up due to falling international student numbers.  Coventry University says it is proud to widen accessibility to education: ""It would be odd to constrain our mission and values within national borders. ""Our long-term strategy of diversifying income to help counter the fact UK tuition fees have been frozen for several years has been successful and remains the right thing to do. ""The sustained growth in student numbers over a number of years allowed us to create many jobs and increased economic and social benefits. We are now having to rebalance the organisation based on changes outside of our control."" The government says its Immigration White Paper will set out ""a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system, linking immigration, skills and visa systems to grow our domestic workforce, end reliance on overseas labour and boost economic growth."" Vivienne Stern, CEO of Universities UK, says funding issues mean universities are reducing students' options - and the drop in international students is hurting communities. ""There are people in all sorts of walks of life who benefit from the fact that universities bring students in who spend money in shops and cafes - local businesses, getting their hair cut, taking taxis.  ""It really contributes to economies right across the UK, and I think that's really special."" Additional reporting by Jonathan Fagg and Miguel Roca-Terry."

University of Sheffield figures show it has seen a 25% drop in international students over the last three years, while Sheffield Hallam has seen a 36% fall. Current international students have told the BBC they feel ""uncertain"" about their long-term future in the UK. Jerry Cheung, managing director of property firm New Era Development, says he is ""deeply concerned"" about how ""friends and colleagues"" are affected by the latest figures. Rao Yan, Sheffield operations manager for international delivery company Hungry Panda, says she has seen a revenue fall of about 40% as most of their customers are Chinese and Malaysian students. ""It's greater here than other cities where the drop for the company is just 20%,"" she says. ""It's a worrying trend. A lot of Chinese restaurants could close."" Kelvin Quik, owner of China Red Restaurant and the bubble tea café ALS Gongcha says he has felt a ""deep impact"". ""We just don't see international students around now. I've had to make changes with more corporate events to keep going,"" he says. Mr Quik, who has targeted his businesses towards East Asian students, says he will not be expanding further. According to the University of Sheffield, international students from the 2022/23 cohort brought a net economic benefit of £771m across all parliamentary constituencies in Sheffield, and £914m in South Yorkshire. In the current academic year 2024/25, there are 4,000 international students enrolled at Sheffield Hallam University. That compares with 4,805 in 2023/24 and 6,272 in 2022/23. The University of Sheffield has seen a similar drop in numbers. In 2022/23 there were 10,101 international students enrolled. That figure fell to 10,010 in 2023/24. This year there are currently 7,546 international students enrolled. Students have told the BBC there are a range of reasons for the fall. Kiara Delgado, from Peru, studies international relations at the University of Sheffield. ""We are looking for educational excellence, when the University (of Sheffield) fell out of the top 100 in the world ranking, suddenly it's less an attractive option,"" she says. Hajar Amrhar is from Morocco but grew up in Saudi Arabia. ""As an international student you are welcomed for the money but I don't feel  welcome to stay,"" she says. ""There are constant changes with the policies and that is extremely stressful. ""I invested £24,000 in fees but I might have to go back home."" In 2023 the previous government announced foreign postgraduate students on non-research courses would no longer be able to bring family members to the UK, under new immigration curbs. Hares Jamil, from Pakistan, is studying childhood education. He says: ""We've seen riots against immigrants in the last year and international students have been caught up in that. ""It's really uncertain times."" Despite the fall in numbers, local leaders have reiterated their support for international students in South Yorkshire. A statement, coordinated by Sheffield Hallam University and the University of Sheffield, has been signed by both university vice-chancellors, the mayor of South Yorkshire and Sheffield MPs, as well as leaders from the NHS, council and businesses. It says: ""We are proud that, each year, students from more than 150 countries choose to study at our city's two universities and colleges and make our region their home. ""We are grateful for the impact international students have on our communities, from supporting our local economy, to volunteering for our region's charities and causes. ""Not only do they work in our hospitals, schools and businesses, they enrich everyone's lives through sharing their global perspectives, cultures and ideas."" For some Sheffield business owners the downfall has meant a rethink in their target audience. Dong Jen Lee owns a storage company, a North Chinese BBQ restaurant and a Hong Kong café. He admits that he ""used to be busy"". ""One year ago I got quite nervous so I made a decision to look for local people and not just international students.""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8yy09we1eo","Switzerland targets rich tourists but at what cost?",2025-03-03,"Imogen Foulkes","Geneva correspondent, BBC News","The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy. Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too. So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity. In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists. Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer ""ski butlers"" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots. Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night. Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend. But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures. Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism. ""The numbers speak for themselves,"" says Mr Berger. ""The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests."" What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong. ""Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,"" Mr Berger explains. ""There is always somewhere cheaper."" Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts. But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market. A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service. They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary. Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about ""quantity versus quality"", she says. More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive. And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the ""tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character"". Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers – the much-loved ""Down Hill Only"" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year. And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced ""hotel apartments"". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent. By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the ""cold beds"" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation. The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. ""It looks like a typical holiday home complex… there is no integration into the community."" The required public spaces that a hotel would have – a restaurant and a spa – are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. ""The design is unacceptable,"" he adds. Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. ""It's not St Moritz here,"" one told Swiss media, adding ""Wengen is not posh"". Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegmüller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. ""We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,"" he says. Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegmüller believes ""our guests won't want to show off what they have"". The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. ""Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegmüller. 'The locals know them, and that's good."" Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of ""the charm has gone from the place… it's over built"". But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that ""most of the children are beggars"". In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities. And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. ""We have one to five-star [in Wengen],"" adds Mr Wegmüller. ""That's a good thing in a resort.""

Their dispute blew up when Verstappen was penalised for impeding Russell at the Qatar Grand Prix - and the Dutchman said he had ""lost all respect"" for his rival. But Briton Russell hit back, suggesting the Red Bull driver ""cannot deal with adversity"". Russell said at the F1 75 event at London's O2 Arena on Tuesday that he and Verstappen ""hadn't spoken"" over the winter. ""I've got no intentions [to], to be honest,"" the Mercedes driver said in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live. ""That happened last year. I want to focus on myself. Things got out of line last year. That was then. We are not going to go back to being best mates, that's for sure."" The spat ended last year on a sour note for the two drivers, who have had run-ins in previous seasons. Later on Tuesday, Verstappen was asked about Russell's comments and said: ""I have no intention of continuing any kind of beef in February. I have nothing to say about that subject."" Asked whether he had concerns about the situation, Russell said: ""No concerns about him or his driving. I am not going to change my approach fighting him or other drivers."" Russell also expressed his opinions about the decision by governing body the FIA to codify a system that could lead to drivers being banned for swearing or criticising race officials. The 27-year-old, who is a director of F1 drivers' body the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA), said: ""It's going quite far. As drivers we have to continue to show our personalities. We don't want to be in a bubble. That's pretty obvious. ""There is merit in saying you shouldn't swear in an environment like this [a news conference]. But when it's not your first language the first words you get taught are the swear words."" Last year, Verstappen was ordered to do a form of motorsport community service after swearing in a news conference at the Singapore Grand Prix. The four-time world champion responded by restricting his answers in an official FIA news conference the following day and speaking to journalists outside the room. Asked about the FIA increasing the severity of the potential punishments for swearing, Verstappen said: ""I don't need to say anything, Everyone's reaction to it, that says enough.  ""I of course understand you cannot swear anywhere. But in the heat of the moment, playing sport, sometimes things slip out a little bit. Plus we all grew up, playing sport or football; it happens that you use a swear word, and we shouldn't take it so serious. I am not going to tell you how you should behave in life. But we have to deal with it."" At the weekend, world rally driver Adrien Fourmaux became the first driver punished under the new ruling. He was fined 10,000 euros (£8,300), with a further 20,000 euros (£16,600) suspended, for swearing in a TV interview after a special stage. Last week, Williams drivers Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon both said it was wrong to threaten drivers with bans for swearing - but agreed drivers should watch their language out of the car."

Mr Kwek says he has filed court papers accusing his son Sherman of trying to take control of their real estate firm City Developments Limited (CDL). Sherman Kwek has denied the allegation. Kwek Leng Beng, who is CDL's executive chairman, is also seeking to fire his son, who is the chief executive. CDL, Singapore's biggest listed property developer, has halted trading in its shares on the financial hub's stock exchange. The feud has sparked comparisons with the HBO television series Succession, in which the fictional Roy family fight for control of the global media firm Waystar RoyCo. ""We intend to change the chief executive officer at the appropriate time,"" Kwek Leng Beng said in a statement. ""As a father, firing my son was certainly not an easy decision."" But the octogenarian added: ""This is necessary to deal with this attempted coup at the board level and restore corporate integrity."" If Sherman Kwek is removed as chief executive, his father said he plans to replace him on an interim basis with his cousin Kwek Eik Sheng. The dispute centres on an email sent by CDL's corporate secretary nominating two additional independent directors on the night of 28 January, the eve of the Lunar New Year - which marks the start of a major holiday in Singapore. The row has attracted public attention in a part of the world in which battles over family businesses are not uncommon and have been known to end up in court.  After Wednesday's court hearing, Kwek Leng Beng said the two new directors had agreed to not exercise any powers until further notice. The company has said Sherman Kwek would remain in the role until the issue was resolved. Sherman Kwek said he and the majority of CDL's board were disappointed by what he described as extreme actions taken by his father ""regarding this disagreement around the size and make-up of the CDL board."" “To reiterate, this has never been about ousting our esteemed chairman. These steps to strengthen our board have purely been to ensure CDL has the highest standards of governance to which it has become known,"" he said in a statement to the BBC. Kwek Leng Beng, along with his father and brother, took control of then-loss-making CDL in 1971. He became the firm's executive chairman after his father's death in 1995. It now has more than 160 hotel, residential and commercial properties around the world and forms part of a multi-billion dollar family empire. "

Sales of the firm's chips hit more than $39bn (£30.7bn) over the three months ended 27 January, up 74% year-on-year. Nvidia has seen a surge of demand, as big tech companies turn to the firm for chips that can handle the large amounts of data used to train AI models.  But DeepSeek said it had trained its chatbot using less advanced, and less expensive chips.  Its launch prompted a sharp sell-off in Nvidia shares earlier this month, a hit felt throughout the market.  Investors calmed after big companies such as Facebook owner Meta said they expected to continue their current AI investment strategies.  Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said he was not worried that demand would suddenly shift, saying that software in the future would be created by machine learning that needs chips with different architecture than the ""hand-coding"" of the past.  ""We know fundamentally software has changed,"" he said, adding that it was also still ""early days"" for the use of AI to spread. Nvidia currently dominates the market in advanced chips, making it central to the boom in AI investment at companies such as Microsoft. Its shares have surged more than 400% over the last two years, giving the company a market value of more than $3tn.  Nvidia said it was focused on rapidly building out production of its latest chips, known as Blackwell, which helped to drive a surge in the firm's revenue.  The company's finance chief Collette Kress said its AI data centre business was strongest in the US, but the firm was also seeing demand grow in other parts of the world, pointing to investments by France and the European Union. She said demand in China - where US trade controls have blocked the firm from exporting certain chips - remained lower and that the firm expected shipments to remain roughly at the current level. "

Smith, 52, is seen as one of the front-runners for the role vacated by Warren Gatland, but has a further season on his Glasgow contract. ""I want to coach internationally again, but for now I'll focus on what needs to be done at Glasgow Warriors,"" said Smith after his team's 45-20 win over Dragons. He has previous international experience with Italy and as an assistant for his native South Africa, while his playing career included a season at Newport. ""Most coaches in the world work to do that (get an international coaching job),"" Smith told BBC Sport Wales.  ""I've been involved with Italy, had a stint with South Africa so I've had a taste of it. ""The experience with Italy was different to what it should be, but there was a good opportunity to change their progress as well."" Ireland's interim coach Simon Easterby, another potential target for the Welsh Rugby Union, was also at a Welsh ground in the international down-week as he saw Leinster's win at the Ospreys. Other names being mentioned in the Wales reckoning include former Australia and Argentina coach Michael Cheika, who is set to leave Leicester after one season, and Scotland assistants Brad Mooar and Steve Tandy, who have both run Welsh professional clubs. Despite Wales's 14th consecutive defeat leading to Gatland's departure, and a winless URC weekend for the four Welsh professional sides, Smith was keen not to share in the doom and gloom felt by many Welsh supporters. ""I watched the Ospreys play, there's good players there and they're a good quality side, Scarlets have been performing well, Cardiff are up there (in the top half of the URC) and some of the Dragons' actions were good quality. ""There's work to be done but there's enough positives to be taken and I don't think all is lost for Wales, Gatland did a great job for many years."" Smith's Italy did not win in the Six Nations for two seasons before he moved to a different role as high performance director, but he believes his time there sowed the seeds for their competitive revival. ""Italy was in the same position as Wales when I took over at the back end of the 2019 World Cup, they had a big turnover of players and Zebre and Benetton weren't performing in the Pro14,"" Smith added. ""I was brave enough to pick the younger boys and get them going, and hopefully by 2031 they'll be the team with the most caps ever because I started them so young. ""It was a big challenge for me, I've learned from it and that's a skill I've developed."" Smith's stock is currently high after steering Glasgow to a maiden triumph in the URC in 2024 and seeing them strongly placed behind Leinster in the current campaign. ""The Wales job is not yet something I can talk about, but from a general point of view in my history as a coach I developed Benetton and helped them get to the Magners League as it was then, I developed the Cheetahs and helped them get to the Pro14,"" Smith said. ""It's the story of my coaching career, I always see the glass as half-full and not half-empty, and that's the approach Wales should follow. ""Warren Gatland did a great job and Wales has got so much passion for the game, so there's a lot of good ingredients in Welsh rugby to find their feet again."""

The social media platform's boss Adam Mosseri told staff about the potential move this week, according to technology industry–focused business publication The Information, which cited a person who heard the remarks. Instagram's parent company Meta did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. In January, US President Donald Trump granted TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law signed by then-President Joe Biden that requires a sale or ban of the platform. At the time, he floated the possibility of a joint venture running the company, saying he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between ""the United States"" and its Chinese owner ByteDance. But he did not give any further details on how that might work. The Biden administration had argued that TikTok, which has 170 million US users, could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation. Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open. In 2018, Meta launched a standalone app called Lasso to compete with TikTok but it was later shut down."

Bridgwater Senior Citizens' Forum said it believes automation is replacing workers and damaging customer service.  Forum chairman Ken Jones said the group's campaign is not about older people struggling with technology but about promoting employment and social ties.  ""More and more supermarkets are replacing staff with machines, and we must help to reverse the trend,"" he said.  Mr Jones added: ""The knowledge and advice of retail staff is invaluable, but we also value human interaction above machines and artificial intelligence. ""Just saying hello to someone makes you come back, especially in dark days of winter. ""The feelgood factor, you can't put a price on it can you?"" Self-checkouts are present many UK stores and campaigners argue that automation, energy costs, and online shopping are accelerating the decline of town centres and eroding traditional face-to-face retail experiences. A recent study by the Centre for Retail Research found about 170,000 UK retail jobs were lost in 2024, with most of those roles held by women. However, retailers argue self-service tills reflect changing consumer habits and offer speed and convenience. Kris Hamer, director of insight at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""The expansion of self-service checkouts is a response to changing consumer behaviours, which show many people prioritising speed and convenience.  ""Many retailers provide manned and unmanned checkouts as they work to deliver great service at low cost for their customers"". However, Glen Burrows, a member of the Bridgwater Senior Citizens' Forum, said the issue goes beyond technology. ""For a lot of people, shopping is about communication, about getting out and about – we don't want it to be a soulless experience between one person and a machine,"" she said. ""I just want us to get back to shopping being part of a human community service and not a robotic experience. ""We're quite right to say we don't want to go down that road.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7yxm3py5o","Can AI help modernise Ireland's healthcare system?",2025-02-28,"Padraig Belton","Technology Reporter","For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology. They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics. In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E. Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online. But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare. That includes a programme called Sláintecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its €22.9bn (£20bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's. To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved. It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department. That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen. ""In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,"" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater. Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment. To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: ""We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures."" The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to. ""Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,"" he says. Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges. Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends. Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin. But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a ""synthetic MRI"" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries. That was done by feeding a ""generative AI"" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person. Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments. And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends. Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008. But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally. That will ""severely delay"" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon. Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge. ""Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,"" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin. ""Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,"" he says. Using AI in healthcare is not without problems. An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing. But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.  To prevent such AI from hallucinating, ""you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,"" says Prof MacMahon. AIs can have biases, but ""humans have biases too"", he points out. A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot. ""For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error"", than in new health technology where ""the acceptable risk is zero"", says Prof Seán Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin. This means we ""continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans"", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says. Healthcare regulators, who already have a ""weak enough"" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University. For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured. But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. ""For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,"" he points out. AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them. That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin. When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to ""be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,"" he says."

Permanent staff are not affected by the cuts. The bank's outgoing chief executive Piyush Gupta also said it expected to create around 1,000 new AI-related jobs. It makes DBS one of the first major banks to offer details on how AI will affect its operations. The company did not say how many jobs would be cut in Singapore. ""Over the next three years, we envisage that AI could reduce the need to renew about 4,000 temporary/contract staff across our 19 markets working on specific projects,"" the DBS spokesperson said.

From Tuesday, food and animal feed products need to be processed or owned in Northern Ireland by a Northern Ireland registered business to maintain unfettered access. A UK government spokesperson said qualifying goods will continue to ""benefit from unfettered access"" to the rest of the UK market and will not face border controls. They added that this applied ""regardless of whether they arrive directly from Northern Ireland or indirectly via Ireland"".  It follows consultation with industry which was concerned that post-Brexit trading rules could be exploited so food from other countries be moved via Northern Ireland to get easy access to GB. A UK government spokesperson said these controls ""ensure that goods from the EU and rest of world entering Great Britain through Northern Ireland are subject to the same regime of biosecurity controls as those entering Great Britain from the Republic of Ireland"". Northern Ireland has effectively remained in the EU's single market for goods after Brexit, meaning goods can cross from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland without checks or controls. However, those EU goods should be declared and checked if they are then being moved on into the wider UK. Enforcing that rule is difficult because successive UK governments have promised NI ""unfettered"" access to the GB market. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson famously told Northern Ireland businesses that if anyone asked them to fill in a form for moving goods to GB they should throw it in a bin. In November 2019, he said: ""There will be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind - you will have unfettered access."" That promise was given legal form by the Qualifying NI Goods Regulations which said that any goods in free circulation in Northern Ireland count as qualifying. The very wide definition of qualifying was always intended to be narrowed and the tighter rules for food were drawn up after consultation with industry. The change is principally to enable food and feed to be traceable to a registered Northern Irish business and to limit potential avoidance of checks on goods arriving into GB. So called ""non-qualifying"" food products can still be shipped to GB from Northern Ireland but will need official certificates, have to be declared to the GB authorities and will be checked at ports. There will be no changes for ""qualifying"" products."

Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison. In her appeal, she challenged trial evidence and testimony and argued that statements by her ex-business and romantic partner Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani about his level of responsibility for Theranos' financial model should have been included. He was jailed for more than 12 years. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the arguments. Judge Jacqueline H Nguyen wrote that Theranos's claim of being able to run blood tests with a drop from a finger prick instead of a needle in a vein was ""nothing more than a mirage"". ""The grandiose achievements touted by Holmes and Balwani were half-truths and outright lies,"" Nguyen wrote in the opinion on behalf of a three-judge panel published on Monday. Holmes was convicted in 2022 of conspiracy and multiple charges of wire fraud for misleading investors over the company's financial health and the effectiveness of its technology. Balwani, who was tried separately and additionally convicted of defrauding patients in 2022, also lost his appeal. In the appeal, both challenged a court order to pay $452m (£358m) in restitution to victims, which the court upheld. In Holmes's appeal, she argued that statements from Balwani where he said he ""owned"" the company's financial model should have been included in the trial. The appeal also argued that former Theranos employees offered improper expert testimony and a government inspection report should not have been included as evidence - all arguments the court dismissed. Silicon Valley start-up Theranos was once valued at $9bn (£7bn). But in late 2015, news reporting revealed internal struggles at the company and exposed the limitations of its technology. After a two-and-a-half-year investigation, a grand jury indicted Holmes and Balwani, leading to their convictions and sentencings. Holmes entered prison in Texas in 2023."

A display has opened at Stories of Lynn Museum, drawing parallels between Mrs Coxon's achievements and those of contemporary women leaders.  Among them are Jane Steen, the Bishop of King's Lynn, and the commander of RAF Marham, Group Captain Leonie Boyd. The display has been organised ahead of International Women's Day, on 8 March.  Mrs Coxon's great-grandson, Tony Bellars, said her husband had also been Mayor of King's Lynn before her.  ""She was a pioneering woman I think,"" he said.  ""Her husband was a bit overbearing and it's believed she was beginning to feel a bit belittled.  ""So she set out to prove anything you can do I can do a lot better. And she did.""

We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes. What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet. A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes. ""People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,"" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City. Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product – coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts. As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup – accounting for more than 80% of production – it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup. Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. ""Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes versus just boiling it into syrup."" He joined the company back in 2016, three years after it was founded by his business partner Stéphane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace. Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings. ""It's more than just a local product at this point,"" adds Mr Leclerc. For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (£409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033. By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up. Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study. Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits. ""When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,"" she says. ""So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery."" However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was ""was not superior in rehydration"" to normal water. Jeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world. His family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go. He says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms. ""It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,"" he says. Mr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. ""When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,"" he says. Marketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange. Mr Tomory says he agrees with this approach to make the sap more interesting. ""I know a lot of people have tried just selling the sap as it is, just basic sap from the tree and it's still, but they haven't really caught on,"" he says. ""So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation."" Back at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: ""It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,"" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj30xr1vy2lo","Countries compete to keep skilled young workers",2025-02-25,"Pedro Garcia","Technology Reporter, Lisbon","In 2020, Duarte Dias, a Portuguese software engineer, accepted a job offer to work in Microsoft's Dublin subsidiary. A little over a year later, he joined a team at Microsoft's headquarters in Seattle, where he still works. Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career. Mr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving. The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous. ""I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,"" says. A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior Técnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to €35,000 ($36,000; £29,000). But his take home salary was much, much less. His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.  ""Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,"" he recalls. Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to €60,000. The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home. Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with ""with many more savings"". Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments. In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education. In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data. After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels. The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance. But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad. ""It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under €28,000,"" says Sérgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Católica Lisbon School of Law. He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.  Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal. That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD. ""This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,"" adds Mr Vasques. Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: ""I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year. ""Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime"". Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration.  According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages. ""The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,"" she said. Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to ""leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return."" Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad. ""Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of €1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me €4,200 for a junior role."" Even with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. ""It wasn't a difficult decision,"" says Mr Almeida. Now in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. ""I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons. ""But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes."" Mr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home. ""Up until today I never thought about it."" Mr Dias agrees: ""Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there""."

Leila Osman is a United Nations junior professional officer and has been working in Kyiv with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) since last April. The publicly-funded relief and development agency Jersey Overseas Aid (JOA) helps people in the island get in to the UN's junior professional officer scheme. Ms Osman said: ""Jersey as a very small place... is doing a lot"" to help Ukrainians and she was ""very proud"" to be part of that. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or injured since the war started on 24 February 2022. Ms Osman said ""there's a daily bombardment"" where she lives in Kyiv and ""this shelling can be a bit taxing at times"". She added: ""But, thankfully, in Kyiv we have good air defence, which is great. ""However, closer to the front lines, there are people living with without that luxury, and they are hit on a daily basis without the chance to have a warning or get down to shelter."" Ms Osman works to help those who have been displaced with Ukraine by the fighting, as well as refugees fleeing the country. She said the humanitarian situation was ""particularly dire"" in the east of Ukraine on the front lines and the ""effects of war in Ukraine have been very hard on the whole population"". She added: ""Further away from the front lines, one of the main activities that UNHCR does is providing immediate emergency response, so it's going to the places directly following attacks and helping people with their emergency needs, like providing money and funding for food, clothes and fuel."" Ms Osman has also seen the wider work of JOA during her time in Ukraine. She said Russia's attacks had destroyed two-thirds of the country's energy infrastructure so ""people were in freezing temperatures of -10C to -20C [14F to -4F]  in the east of Ukraine are left without power"". Dealing with landmines would also be a major operation after the war, she also said.  She said: ""JOA has a very active de-mining program, which is going to be a massive thing when the war ends in Ukraine because it's one of the most heavily mined situations we've ever had.

The PM announced the UK will reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, following President Trump's demand that all European allies increase their defence contributions. The decision comes as Sir Keir is set to fly to the US for talks with Trump in the White House, to discuss the war in Ukraine, later. Badenoch questioned Sir Keir over the exact amount, which Defence Secretary John Healey said could be calculated as £6bn when inflation was taken into account, and whether the Chagos deal would be funded from it. At Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch asked whether any of the new funding would be going towards the multi-billion pound Chagos deal twice. The UK plans to hand over the territory to Mauritius, but under the terms of the deal, the UK will continue to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase, for a period of 99 years. The PM responded saying the increase in defence spending that was announced on Tuesday was for ""our capability on defence and security in Europe"", adding: ""The Chagos deal is extremely important for our security and for US security."" Badenoch focused her questions to the prime minister on which figure for the defence rise - his initial £13.4bn or £6bn, which Healey said was the increase ""in real terms""  - was correct. Sir Keir responded: ""If you take the numbers for this financial year and then the numbers for the financial year 2027-28, that's a £13.4bn increase. ""That's the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War which will put us in a position to ensure the security and defence of our country and of Europe."" Badenoch pressed him again, saying: ""The IFS said today that the government is playing silly games with numbers. How does he find this difference in numbers?"" Repeating himself, the PM then said they had already been ""going through the same question over and over again"" at previous PMQs and said ""if you ask again I'll give the same answer again"", to loud cheers from his backbenchers. Objecting, Badenoch pointed out that ""being patronising is not the same as answering the question"". When Badenoch suggested Sir Keir had listened to her advice on using international aid money for defence, he said: ""I'm going to have to let the leader of the opposition down gently... She didn't feature in my thinking at all.  ""I was so busy over the weekend I didn't even see her proposal.  ""She has appointed herself I think saviour of the western civilisation in a desperate search for relevance."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey urged the prime minister to back the idea of a European rearmament bank ""so that we can finance a big increase in manufacturing capacity without the need to cut Britain's vital soft power"". The prime minister replied that there was ""an ongoing discussion"" with allies about future funding and he would share details with MPs ""as it evolves"".  Earlier, a former defence chief of staff said he believed the decision to hike UK defence spending has been ""accelerated"" by President Donald Trump's actions on Ukraine. General Sir David Richards said the decision to raise defence spending over the next two years was a sound strategic move, but one that ""almost certainly would not"" be happening if not for Trump. ""It was going to happen, it's now been accelerated by Donald Trump's actions, and all of us, I think, would say not before time,"" he told  BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  Lord Richards stressed the British Army was currently ""very hollowed out indeed"" and suggested the ""army isn't big enough"" currently for British troops to be part of a rotation of European peacekeeping forces. Questions have been raised about the Labour government's U-turn on its manifesto pledge to raise international development funding to 0.7% of gross national income, with unease among some Labour MPs about the move. Speaking at PMQs, Labour backbencher Diane Abbott suggested the decision could increase the risk of conflict abroad, telling the PM that ""there is also a view that taking money from aid and development to spend on armaments and tanks makes people less safe, not more safe, because the desperation and poverty that so often leads to warfare is what aid and development money is supposed to counter."" The PM defended the decision in the chamber, and earlier Healey had said ""hard power is now more important than soft power"". Asked whether the increase announced on Tuesday is linked to Sir Keir's visit to the White House, Healey told the Today programme: ""President Trump, over the last two weeks, has been very direct in his challenge. ""He's reinforced the imperative and the importance of Britain making this commitment and helping other European countries to step up in a similar way."" The US has been warning European leaders it wants to see a significant increase in their defence contributions to Nato for at least a decade. Trump's rapprochement with Russia's Vladimir Putin, and the US siding with Russia on a UN resolution on Ukraine, has sent shockwaves through European allies. Asked whether he believed the UK increasing its defence contribution would bring Trump on side, Healey said that the PM could now tell Trump: ""You are challenging Europe and the UK to step up on European security, on Ukraine, on defence spending, on reinforcing our industrial base.  ""We are, and we will step up further."" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

Speaking on board one of the 35-year-old presidential planes that are currently in use, Trump also said he is looking for alternatives because it is taking Boeing too long to build the planes. The contract for two updated versions of the presidential plane based on the more modern Boeing 747-8 were negotiated during Trump's first term in office. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News.  ""No, I'm not happy with Boeing. It takes them a long time to do, you know, Air Force One, we gave that contract out a long time ago,"" Trump said.  ""We may buy a plane or get a plane, or something."" When asked whether he would consider buying new planes from Boeing's European rival, Airbus, Trump said ""No, I would not consider Airbus over Boeing, but I could buy one that was used and convert it."" It comes days after Trump visited a 13-year-old Boeing 747-8 that had been owned by the Qatari royal family while it was parked at Palm Beach International Airport. The new aircraft from Boeing were set for delivery in 2024 but the plane maker has pushed the delivery back to 2027 or 2028. During his first term as president, Trump forced the plane maker to renegotiate its contract, calling the initial deal too expensive. That contract has already cost Boeing billions of dollars. Kitting out the planes for presidential use is extremely costly. It requires installing highly-classified and complex communications, safety and accessibility features.  Last year was dreadful for Boeing. The aerospace giant lost $11.8bn (£9.4bn) across the whole of 2024, its worst result since 2020, when the aviation industry was grounded by the Covid pandemic. In the three months to the end of December, when strikes were affecting the business, it lost $3.8bn. As well as suffering from well-publicised problems at its commercial aircraft unit, Boeing also faced issues with a number of defence programmes."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj91xgylkwlo","Georgia's richest man said to be moving funds to avoid US sanctions",2025-02-20,"Rayhan Demytrie","South Caucasus correspondent","Last spring, when tens of thousands of Georgians were protesting against what they saw as a clear sign of Russian influence on the country's politics, Georgia's parliament rushed through amendments to the nation's tax code. Transparency International (TI) Georgia, the anti-corruption watchdog, wrote at the time that the change – which allows tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia – may have been introduced to serve the interests of the country's richest person and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili. He is the founder and honorary chairman of the country's ruling party, Georgian Dream. ""Now it is clear, those changes were made for him,"" says senior economics analyst at TI Georgia, Beso Namchavadze. With an estimated wealth of $4.9bn (£3.9bn), Mr Ivanishvili made his money in 1990s Russia, in computing, metals and banking. Most of his wealth is believed to be tucked away in offshore companies. Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the country's MPs passed the contentious ""transparency on foreign influence bill"", often dubbed the ""foreign agents law"". Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad have to register as ""organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power"", submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country. Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold. Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police. In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year. There is also the possibility of sanctions from the UK. Last month James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat MP, introduced an Early Day Motion in the UK parliament calling on the government to impose sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili. The motion expressed ""deep concern at the suspension of Georgia's EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters"". TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. ""All his big business, which he has in Georgia, in the hospitality sector, in the energy sector, all the parent companies of these Georgian companies, the last beneficiaries are registered in these so-called offshore territories,"" says Beso Namchavadze. He adds that TI Georgia believes that Mr Ivanishvili and other family members are continuing to transfer ownership of companies they previously controlled through offshore entities to newly established firms in Georgia. In January of this year, paintings and other artwork worth nearly $500m were imported into Georgia, according to data published by the Ministry of Finance. Many believe the artwork was from Mr Ivanishvili's valuable collection. ""For everybody who knows him it's pretty clear that this is something that he values the most out of all the assets, and all the wealth, that he has,"" says Tina Khidasheli, Georgia's ex-defence minister and the head of the non-governmental organisation Civic Idea. ""He is going to bring paintings back and he does not want to pay tax on it."" The head of Georgia's parliamentary committee on finance and budget, Paata Kvijinadze, recently defended the tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia. ""If anyone benefited from this law, I am happy about it,"" he said in a post on social media. ""This is exactly what the law was meant to be: to bring companies from offshore zones and attract more investments into the country"". In response to the proposed UK sanctions, Georgia's ruling party issued a statement defending Mr Ivanishvili, saying that a threat of sanctions was ""without any foundation"" against the party founder who brought ""democratic breakthrough to the country"". Separately, Mr Ivanishvili's lawyer announced last month that his client is suing Swiss bank Julius Baer for, among other reasons, misinterpreting ""the so-called"" American sanctions, which the lawyer described as ""political blackmail"".   The US sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili call for his assets to be frozen, and place restrictions on US citizens and companies from doing business personally with him, but they do not affect his companies or family members. For more than a decade Mr Ivanishvili has been involved in legal battles with another Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, over fraud and mismanagement of his money. Some believe that the billionaire's mistrust of the West and increased use of conspiracy theories at home, such as accusing adversaries of being part of the ""global war party"", or ""deep state"", originate in his long-standing financial grievances. Ever since he became convinced that Credit Suisse was part of a grand conspiracy against him, says Tina Khdasheli. ""Bidzina Ivanishvili held Georgia hostage to his personal financial issues."" Experts say that even though Mr Ivanishvili's current official position is the honorary chairman of the ruling party, there is a clear understanding that he remains the number one person in Georgian politics. Sanctions against him are therefore seen as sanctions against the entire government. Nika Gilauri was prime minister of Georgia from 2009 to 2012. He now leads a private company called Reformatics, which advises governments around the world on economic reform. Mr Gilauri says that Georgia's continuing political instability and international isolation is negatively impacting the economy. ""We are seeing a very negative effect on FDI, foreign direct investment, if you take nine months of 2024 compared to nine months of 2023, we have a 40% drop. So going forward this is going to continue to get worse."" But the Georgian government paints a different picture. Last month Georgia's Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze signed a $6bn inward investment agreement with UAE property group Emaar. Levan Davitashvili, the Minister of Economy described it as the ""largest foreign investment deal"" in decades, which was expected to contribute 1.5% growth to the economy. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has even suggested that 10% growth was now ""absolutely realistic"" for the Georgian economy. But recently published research by Policy and Management Consulting Group (PMCG), a Georgian research firm, said that the prospect for the next six months was ""extremely negative"". It highlighted the impact of the continuing political turmoil, and said that the suspension of EU membership talks ""was negatively viewed by all surveyed economists"". Mr Gilauri of Reformatics says their own analysis shows that Georgia's economic growth this year will be zero. ""Going forward, we will have a budgetary problem, a currency exchange problem. We will have an inflation problem. We will have a jobs problem, a job creation problem, and we will have economic decline problem. ""Having new elections is the only way forward for the country as well as for Bidzina Ivanishvili personally."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8edn0n58gwo","UK and US refuse to sign international AI declaration",2025-02-11,"Zoe Kleinman & Liv McMahon","Technology editor & reporter","The UK and US have not signed an international agreement on artificial intelligence (AI) at a global summit in Paris. The statement, signed by dozens of countries including France, China and India, pledges an ""open"", ""inclusive"" and ""ethical"" approach to the technology's development. In a brief statement, the UK government said it had not been able to add its name to it because of concerns about national security and ""global governance."" Earlier, US Vice President JD Vance told delegates in Paris that too much regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) could ""kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off"". Vance told world leaders that AI was ""an opportunity that the Trump administration will not squander"" and said ""pro-growth AI policies"" should be prioritised over safety. His comments appear to put him at odds with French President Emmanuel Macron, who defended the need for further regulation. ""We need these rules for AI to move forward,"" Macron said at the summit. The UK has previously been a champion of the idea of AI safety, with then prime minister Rishi Sunak holding the world's first AI Safety Summit in November 2023. Andrew Dudfield, head of AI at fact-checking organisation Full Fact, said the government's decision not to sign the Paris communique put that in jeopardy. ""By refusing to sign today's international AI Action Statement the UK Government risks undercutting its hard-won credibility as a world leader for safe, ethical and trustworthy AI innovation,"" he said. However UKAI - a trade body representing businesses working in the sector across the country - said it was the right decision. ""While UKAI agrees that being environmentally responsible is important, we question how to balance this responsibility with the growing needs of the AI industry for more energy,"" said its chief executive Tim Flagg. ""UKAI cautiously welcomes the Government's refusal to sign this statement as an indication that it will explore the more pragmatic solutions that UKAI has been calling for - retaining opportunities to work closely with our US partners"", he added. The statement signed by 60 countries sets out an ambition to reduce digital divides by promoting AI accessibility, and ensuring the tech's development is ""transparent"", ""safe"" as well as ""secure and trustworthy"". ""Making AI sustainable for people and the planet,"" is listed as a further priority. The agreement also notes that AI energy use - which experts have warned could rise to use as much as small countries in years to come - was discussed at a summit for the first time. ""Looking at the summit declaration, it's difficult to pinpoint what exactly in that statement the government disagrees with,"" said Michael Birtwistle, associate director at the Ada Lovelace Institute. The government said in a statement it ""agreed with much of the leader's declaration"" but felt it was lacking in some parts. ""We felt the declaration didn't provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it,"" a government spokesperson said. The government has signed other agreements at the Paris AI Action Summit, including about sustainability and cybersecurity, they added. Downing Street has also insisted it has not been led by the Trump administration. ""This isn't about the US, this is about our own national interest, ensuring the balance between opportunity and security"", a spokesperson said. It comes amid discussions at the summit about the impact of AI development on society, the environment and governance. Policy-makers, executives and diplomats have been mulling ways to capture the economic benefits of AI innovation, while addressing the technology's risks. It was kicked off by Macron posting a compilation of jokey deepfake clips of himself in popular films and TV series on social media. ""This summit is focused on action, and that is exactly what we need right now,"" said European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday. She said Europe's approach to AI, which has been championed throughout the summit, would also emphasise innovation, collaboration and ""embrace the power of open source"" technology. The meeting is also taking place at a time of growing trade tensions between the US and Europe. President Tump has decided to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the US, a move that will affect the UK and EU. It's understood the UK will not immediately retaliate, as it seeks to tread a delicate path of maintaining good relations with the Trump administration while also building closer ties with the EU."

Yum Brands said it will shift the office from Louisville to Plano though KFC will keep  some operations in Kentucky, including its KFC Foundation. However, Andy Beshear, governor of the state of Kentucky, said: ""I am disappointed by this decision and believe the company's founder would be, too. In recent years, many companies have relocated to Texas attracted by the state's lower taxes and business-friendly policies. The decision by Yum Brands is part of a plan to have two headquarters for its main brands. KFC and Pizza Hut will be in Plano while Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill will remain in Irvine, California. Yum Brands' chief executive David Gibbs, said: ""These changes position us for sustainable growth and will help us better serve our customers, employees, franchisees and shareholders."" But Beshear said: ""This company's name starts with Kentucky, and it has marketed our state's heritage and culture in the sale of its product."" KFC's history in the state dates back to the 1930s, when its founder Colonel Harland Sanders began selling fried chicken at a service station in Corbin. Today, Sanders' face is emblazoned on the shop fronts of more than 24,000 KFC restaurants in over 145 countries and territories around the world. Since the pandemic, many US companies have moved their headquarters. According to a report by real estate services firm CBRE, Austin and other Texan cities have been particularly successful due to the state's business-friendly environment."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yvyl710jpo","What does Jack Ma's return to the spotlight mean?",2025-02-21,"João da Silva","Business reporter","A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event. The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020. His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general. The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.  On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year. So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng? Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event. ""Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,"" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote. Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight. ""Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,"" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.  ""The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,"" said another. It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma. Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a ""pawn-shop mentality"" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry. An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace. He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.  That was before his ""pawn shop"" comment, when he also lamented the ""lack of innovation"" in the country's banks.  It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (£27.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant. This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken. Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.  Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.  Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated. Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as ""temporary"" and ""localised"". He also said it was the ""right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents"". This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces. Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.  Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets. Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the ""common prosperity"" campaign. The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings. But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors. This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.  Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough. As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership ""had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand"". Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors. ""The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,"" said a note from market analysts at Citi. ""[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy."" Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's ""care and support"" for businesses.  The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a ""Sputnik moment"": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month. Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector. Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment. But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China. Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs. Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities. The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as ""high-quality development"" and ""new productive forces"". Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI. The goal is to achieve ""socialist modernisation"" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology. Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board. ""Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,"" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.  ""While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq9zxxn72qo","Will quantum computers disrupt critical infrastructure?",2025-02-21,"Joe Fay","Technology Reporter","Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky. Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal. Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world’s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated. That’s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack. Quantum computing is radically different to the “classical” computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states – one or zero, on or off – quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions. “The reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,” Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's “much, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.” This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems. The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today’s computer networks. Today’s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes. This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. “Anything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,” says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2. Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away. But progress is being made. In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key ""breakthroughs"" and ""paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer"". Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today’s systems have a few hundred at most. But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices. Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, “What data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?” That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company’s “secret” formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe. Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break. The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards. The agency said these would “secure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.” It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards. The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure. “If you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,” says Mr France. Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. “The challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),” he continues. These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment – legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example – might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards. Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but “It's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.” So, it is trying to help customers build “crypto agility” by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. “That's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.” And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites – such as the Starlink network – should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily. “At any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,” Prof Sastry says. “So, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.” More challenging, he says, are “remote sensing” satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches. While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says François Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol. By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable. ""With cryptography,"" says Mr Dupressoir ""If somebody breaks your system, you will only know once they've got your data."""

The first of the Metro's new fleet entered service in December after several delays, although the Stadler-built train had been confined to the line running between Newcastle and South Shields. Metro operator Nexus said another train had now gone from South Hylton and Sunderland city centre on its way to Newcastle Airport in what it called an ""important step"" for its new fleet. Forty-six new trains are due to replace Metro's ageing stock over the next two years with half of them scheduled to be running by the end of 2025. Nexus managing director Cathy Massarella said it was a ""historic moment for Metro to see the new train travelling across the River Wear with customers on board"". Earlier this month, the organisation confirmed the new trains did not yet have permission to run on tracks owned by Network Rail, which manages the line from Pelaw, in South Tyneside, to South Hylton. Ms Massarella said Nexus had ""worked closely"" with the organisation ""to get everything in place"" for the first journey in Sunderland. Councillor Michael Mordey, leader of the city council, said people in the area would welcome the train's arrival. ""The Metro provides a vital lifeline for many in Sunderland and the introduction of the new trains should not only make for vastly better, more comfortable and more reliable journeys for the many passengers who rely on it, but will encourage more people to use the service.""

Central to his performance is a collection of around 45 wigs. “It’s an alter of identity, helping me transition from my everyday self into exaggerated, glamorous or whimsical characters. The right wig makes me feel more authentic and empowers me to command the stage,"" says Ali, who is based in Mumbai. But getting that look right wasn't easy in the early days. ""When I started my career the accessibility of the wigs was extremely difficult in India. Most of them were to be sourced from abroad or I used to make wigs sourced from whatever was available to me like wool, fabric,"" he says. But things are different now. “The trend is changing. Wigs are no longer just meant for drag or movie artists, but many straight women wear wigs to look different. It's no longer just a hair accessory but a style statement.” Indian hair has always been in demand for wig-making. The nation is the world's biggest exporter of human hair, supplying 85% of global demand.  Kolachi Venkatesh, based in Avadi, Chennai, has been collecting hair for 20 years. He started at the bottom of the industry as a picker - collecting hair from households and rescuing it from the rubbish.  “My parents were hair pickers and then I started doing the same,"" he says. Hair collected by pickers from homes, salons and barbershops is called non-Remy hair.  It requires more processing than Remy hair, which is carefully shaved straight from the scalp. Nevertheless, it has value. ""It’s just thrown away but it's gold,"" says Mr Venkatesh. Those pickers typically sell hair to local traders like Mr Venkatesh for between 10 cents and $1 (£0.80) per kilogram, depending on the quality and length of the hair. Shorter or damaged hair fetches less, while longer strands bring higher prices. For the individual picker, there's not much money in it. “A diligent collector might gather 1–5 kilograms of hair in a day, earning anywhere from 59 cents to $6 per day. This income level is often below minimum wage standards, particularly in rural areas,” says Mr Venkatesh, who has 50 pickers working for him. “While our work contributes to a billion-dollar global market our earnings remain meagre. Intermediaries control prices.”  Most of the Indian hair collected by traders like Mr Venkatesh is exported to China where it is made into wigs. “China has a huge wigmaking industry which is worth five to six billion dollars,"" says Benjamin Cherian from Plexconcil, the hair industry body that promotes the Indian industry and liaises with the government.  If India wants a slice of the lucrative wig market, he says, then it has a lot of catching up to do. ""When we look at China there are hundreds of factories spread across the country which add value to the hair industry, whereas in India the value addition still needs to be picked up,” Mr Cherian says. He says the government needs to help promote investment in the hair industry. ""It needs automated sorting systems, sophisticated hair treatment procedures for the hair collected, innovative production techniques for manufacturing of wigs which will make India stand out.” Instead of exporting hair for hundreds of dollars, India should be selling wigs worth thousands of dollars says Mr Cherian. “We have started working on it but it’s a long way to go. We need to have research and training centres,"" he says. One Indian business trying to make inroads is Delhi-based Diva Divine Hair, co-founded by Krishan Jalani in 2019. It is currently managed by chief executive and co-founder Nidhi Tiwari. The idea was to create high-quality hair extensions and wigs that would appeal to a broader range of customers. ""There is a growing need for these solutions due to rising issues of hair loss and thinning among women in India,"" says Ms Tiwari. The company has been helped by a shift in attitude.  ""Once considered a niche or taboo topic, wigs and extensions are now openly discussed, thanks to evolving social norms and a shift toward acceptance,"" she says. Wigs have also seen a lot of development making them more attractive and comfortable. ""Technologies such as 3D-printed wigs and digital colour-matching tools offer highly personalised options. Lightweight, breathable wig caps and improved adhesives have given customers to wear it for long time without discomfort,"" says Ms Tiwari. At the top end of the hair market is Temple or Remy hair. Much of the supply comes from Hindu temples in the south of the country where hair is shaved off in an act of veneration and faith. Raj Hair International is one of the biggest traders in the Temple hair business.  Craftsmen at the company's Chennai factory sort and grade the hair according to colour, texture and length. ""Remy hair has aligned cuticles, hair flows uniformly in one direction, which leads to less tangling and a silkier texture. This is high-value hair,"" says George Cherion, the company's chief executive. The firm tries to waste as little of the hair as possible. To help with that it developed a machine to untangle the hair. It's allowed them to work faster with fewer staff.  ""Our mission is to constantly upgrade the technology,"" says Mr Cherion. Business is booming.  ""Indian human is in demand globally due to its high quality, natural look, and thinness. The demand is skyrocketing,"" he says.  Back in Mumbai Zeeshan Ali wants to see more Indian wigs on the market. As well as making them more affordable, he has a design suggestion: ""A wig that can create a wow factor."""

Tunbridge Wells is one of only 18 units to receive this certification worldwide. Dr Gemma Via from HU-CI said: ""Humanisation in healthcare is about creating an environment where patients feel seen, heard, and valued as individuals."" Intensive care units look after people with serious and life-threatening conditions, with specialist doctors and nurses supporting patients with long-term recovery. The HU-CI project said it evaluated different aspects of care and the MTW team scored an ""excellent"" rating across 160 standards, ""setting a benchmark for hospitals across Europe"". Lucy Gosnell,  ICU senior sister, said: ""With enhanced rehabilitation practices that start from the patient's admission in intensive care, not only do we see better survival but we see better patient outcomes, and they return to a better quality of life afterwards.""  The trust said hospitals with HU-CI certification have seen a reduction in patients' lengths of stay in intensive care, and a decrease in the symptoms of anxiety and depression.  Research has also shown a fall in the number of patients discharged to a care home or rehabilitation facility, helping them get home more quickly, it added. The Tunbridge Wells unit allows a nominated next-of-kin to visit 24 hours a day, seven days a week, giving them unlimited time with the patient and allowing them to visit at a convenient time. The trust said it was the only unit in the UK to offer this. Dr Gabriel Heras de Calle, director of the project, said: ""This is testament to the enthusiasm and dedication of the team, and a reflection of the great work already being done.""

The government agency said the AI model will become available again to South Korean users when ""improvements and remedies"" are made to ensure it complies with the country's personal data protection laws. In the week after it made global headlines, DeepSeek became hugely popular in South Korea leaping to the top of app stores with over a million weekly users. But its rise in popularity also attracted scrutiny from countries around the world which have imposed restrictions on the app over privacy and national security concerns. South Korea's Personal Information Protection Commission said the DeepSeek app became unavailable on Apple's App Store and Google Play on Saturday evening.  It came after several South Korean government agencies banned their employees from downloading the chatbot to their work devices. South Korea's acting president Choi Sang-mok has described Deepseek as a ""shock"", that could impact the country's industries, beyond AI. Despite the suspension of new downloads, people who already have it on their phones will be able to continue using it or they may just access it via DeepSeek's website.  China's DeepSeek rocked the technology industry, the markets and America's confidence in its AI leadership, when it released its latest app at the end of last month. Its rapid rise as one of the world's favourite AI chatbots sparked concerns  in different jurisdictions. Aside from South Korea, Taiwan and Australia have also banned it from all government devices. The Australian government has insisted its ban is not due to the app's Chinese origins, but because of the ""unacceptable risk"" it says it poses to national security. Italy's regulator, which briefly banned ChatGPT in 2023, has done the same with DeepSeek. The company has been asked to address concerns over its privacy policy before it becomes available again on app stores. Data protection authorities in France and Ireland have also posed questions to DeepSeek about how it handles citizens' personal information - including whether it is stored on servers in China, as its privacy policy suggests. It also says that, like other generative AI tools, it may collect information such as email addresses and dates of birth, and use input prompts to improve their product. Meanwhile, lawmakers in the US have proposed a bill banning DeepSeek from federal devices, citing surveillance concerns.  At the state-government level, Texas, Virginia and New York, have already introduced such rules for their employees. DeepSeek's ""large language model"" (LLM) has reasoning capabilities that are comparable to US models such as OpenAI's o1, but reportedly requires a fraction of the cost to train and run. That has raised questions about the billions of dollars being invested into AI infrastructure in the US and elsewhere."

At the start of this academic year, a report co-authored by Glasgow University warned that thousands of students were at risk of homelessness after it suggested there was a student housing shortfall of more than 6,000 in the city.  Freedom of Information figures obtained by BBC Scotland News show 34 planning applications for purpose-built student housing have been accepted by Glasgow City Council since 1 January 2015. Some of these plans are still under construction.  This includes a 26-storey student housing block in Anderston, which could accommodate 410 students.  A 36-floor student flat development near Charing Cross, housing 784 students, is also under construction. This will be Glasgow's second tallest building, after the Glasgow Science Centre's Tower.  Developers Watkin Jones said the property, which will be called the Ard, will address a ""chronic undersupply"" of student accommodation and free up homes more appropriate for families. However, city centre residents have complained about the amount of student flats being built in the area. In November 2024, a 19 storey student flat was given the green light despite 60 objections from neighbours who claimed that the proposed building was excessive and that there were too many student flats in the city centre already.  A report submitted in support of the application stated that Glasgow was facing a ""major supply shortage"" of student accommodation. Prof James White, a planning and urban design professor at Glasgow University, said that the new flats would bring ""broadly positive benefits"" to the city centre.  He said: ""A lot of the student developments are on the periphery of Glasgow city centre, where the residential population is relatively low. ""These developments bring young people and commerce to these areas, so I think, in a sense, it's positive for the neighbourhoods."" In 2019, Glasgow City Council launched their city centre living strategy, which aims to boost the city centre population to 40,000 by 2035.  Prof White said that while these student developments addressed a current need for more accommodation, he is concerned about their longevity if the market for student housing drops. ""Being wholly reliant on students is problematic from a sustainability perspective,"" he said. ""We need a mix of different housing in the city centre - right now, its skewed towards students and how easy will it be to change those buildings in the future? ""If we're not also building parks and schools, if we do need to change the use of these buildings later, it will be hard for families to move in as they won't have the facilities they need."""

Projects at the city's International Slavery Museum and the Maritime Museum were provisionally allocated the funding by the previous Conservative government in spring 2024. However, the new Labour government announced in the last Autumn Budget that it was ""minded to withdraw the funding"" amid pressure to make savings. Following consultation, ministers have now agreed to approve the sum to ""expand and maintain"" both museums. The attractions are among six major cultural projects in England to be allocated a total of £47m, including schemes in York, Leeds, Coventry and Worcester. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the investment would lead to ""more tourism, more growth and more money in people's pockets"". ""Through investing in these critical cultural projects, we can empower both local leaders and people to really tap into their potential and celebrate everything their home town has to offer,"" she said. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy added: ""This support will empower our cultural organisations to continue playing an essential role in developing skills, talent and high-quality careers in every corner of the UK."" Both museums, located at the Royal Albert Dock, are set to close for three years during a £58m makeover that will see the Grade I-listed buildings link up. The Maritime Museum, which opened in 1986, will also have its welcome space improved. The International Slavery Museum opened on Slavery Remembrance Day - 23 August – in 2007, during events to mark 200 years since British legislation to abolish the transatlantic slave trade.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how Philip Pariyo, 32, became close friends with the woman involved, before he attacked her in a flat in the city in June 2021. Pariyo had repeatedly denied raping the woman, but was found guilty of the offence in December 2024. He had represented his country in Rugby Sevens in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow before disappearing. In a letter addressed to Judge Celia Hughes, he said he was ""genuinely sorry to those who suffered from my actions"". An impact statement written by the woman was read to the court, in which she described the long-term physical and mental impact the attack had had on her. ""No one in the world should go through what I did, fighting and begging for my life. It has left lasting impacts on me, and has felt like an open wound that I can never heal from. ""It's made me feel dirty, numb and tainted. He invaded my body by force and branded me from within. He became an unwanted part of my body that I can't get rid of. ""No one should fight like their life depends on it for something as simple as consent."" Pariyo first came to the UK in 2014, when he was part of the Ugandan Rugby Sevens team for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. He was one of two players who disappeared after the Games, and the following year it emerged he had moved to Cardiff.  There he had claimed asylum and was playing for St Peter's Rugby Club in Roath, before becoming a waste management worker for Cardiff Council. St Peter's confirmed he hasn't played for them for ""at least nine years"".  Defending, John Ryan said Pariyo had claimed asylum on the basis of being accused of being homosexual, and feared returning to Uganda, where it is illegal to be homosexual. The court heard that he first met the woman in 2019 at a funeral in Cardiff. After that the pair became friends, and in 2021 Pariyo and the woman stayed in the city with two other people - including Pariyo's girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time. Judge Celia Hughes said that on the night of the attack, Pariyo had ""badgered"" the woman for sex, who in turn refused. He ignored the refusal, and raped her. The court heard how the pair went to a chemist the next morning to buy the morning after pill, and Pariyo suggested buying condoms, implying he wanted to have sex with her later that day. Sentencing, Judge Celia Hughes called it an ""appalling attack and violation of a woman you called a friend"". She said his not guilty plea was in the face of strong evidence against him, and led to the woman having to relive the ordeal in open court. ""Someone with your physical strength and who played at such a high level in your sport should act as a role model to others. But instead you manhandled this woman as entirely as you wished. ""You pleaded not guilty even though you admitted having sex in your text messages. ""She will never be the same strong confident woman she was before she came to Cardiff to see you, because of your sexual greed."" Judge Celia Hughes also said the sentence would ""adversely affect his asylum claim""."

A majority of member states, including the UK, Germany and France, said that the ICC was ""a vital pillar of the international justice system"". Trump announced the sanctions after hosting Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - the first foreign leader to visit him since returning to power. Last year, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza - which Israel denies - as well as a Hamas commander. The US has condemned the court's ""shameful moral equivalency"" between Israel and Hamas. The US and Israel do not recognise the authority of the ICC, the only global court with powers to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It has also previously launched investigations into US citizens. The ICC counts 125 member states around the world, including the UK and many European nations. The UK, France and Germany were among the 79 signatories to a joint statement issued on Friday to condemn Trump's executive order. Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy were among the absent. Earlier on Friday, the ICC had called on its member states and global civil society to ""stand united for justice and fundamental human rights."" It pledged to continue ""providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world"". The ICC last year issued arrest warrants for US-allied Israeli leaders, and a Hamas commander, over the war in Gaza. ICC prosecutors have said there are ""reasonable grounds"" to suggest Netanyahu, his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas's Mohammed Deif - who was killed last year - bear ""criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity"". But a White House memo circulated on Thursday accused the ICC of creating a ""shameful moral equivalency"" between Hamas and Israel by issuing the warrants at the same time. Trump's order said the ICC's recent actions ""set a dangerous precedent"" which threatened to  ""infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States"". It argued the ICC ""undermines"" the national security and foreign policy work of Washington and its allies. The order also said the US and Israel ""are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war"".  The sanctions were announced while Netanyahu was on a visit to Washington. The list of affected individuals has not yet been announced, but the sanctions could target people who work in ICC investigations. Sanctions could include financial and visa restrictions placed on individuals and their families. The court's technical and IT operations - including evidence gathering - could also be affected. Observers have voiced fears that victims of alleged atrocities may hesitate to testify. The court's inaugural chief prosecutor has told the BBC how the rest of the world responds will be most important. ""It's a challenge for the all the state parties - for all Europe, UK, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - are they going to let Mr Trump to become the global president?"" Luis Moreno Ocampo told the BBC Newshour programme.  The UN has called for the measure to be reversed, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the ICC ""must be able to freely pursue the fight against global impunity"".  But Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he ""strongly"" commended Trump's executive order. He claimed the ICC's actions were ""immoral and have no legal basis"", accusing the court of not operating ""in accordance with international law"". The US has repeatedly rejected any ICC jurisdiction over American officials or citizens, and has accused the court of placing constraints on Israel's right to self-defence, while ignoring Iran and anti-Israel groups.  During his first term in office, Trump imposed sanctions on ICC officials who were investigating whether US forces had committed war crimes in Afghanistan. This included a travel ban and asset freezes against former chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. Those sanctions were lifted by President Joe Biden's administration. But during his last weeks in office, Biden also criticised the ICC's warrant for Netanyahu, calling the move ""outrageous"" and saying there was no equivalence between Israel and Hamas. In response to efforts to what they described as attempts to challenge the ICC's authority, nine nations - including South Africa and Malaysia - launched the Hague Group last month in an effort to defend the court and its rulings. Trump's signing of his latest executive order follows his announcement of a plan for the US to ""take over"" Gaza, resettle its Palestinian population and turn the territory into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"".  After Arab leaders and the UN condemned the idea, the US president restated it on his Truth Social social media platform on Thursday.  In recent years, the court has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, Taliban leaders for ""persecuting Afghan girls and women"" and Myanmar's military leader for crimes against the Rohingya Muslims.

The popular app, which is used by more than 170 million American users, went dark briefly last month in the US as the ban deadline approached.  Trump then signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law banning the app if it is not sold.  TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News. According to Bloomberg, which first reported TikTok's return to app stores in the US, the decision to resume its availability came after Apple and Google received assurances from the Trump administration that they would not be held liable for allowing downloads, and the ban wouldn't be enforced yet.  The ban, which passed with a bipartisan vote in Congress, was signed into law by former President Joe Biden. It ordered TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the US version of the platform to a neutral party to avert an outright ban. The Biden administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation. China and TikTok have repeatedly denied those accusations. Beijing has also previously rejected calls for a sale of TikTok's US operations. The law banning the app was supported by US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and it was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court. Trump himself had supported banning the app during his first term in office but he appeared to have a change of heart last year during the presidential race. He professed a ""warm spot"" for the app, touting the billions of views he says his videos attracted on the platform during last year's presidential campaign. When the app started working again in the US last month, a popup message was sent to its millions of users that thanked Trump by name. TikTok chief executive Shou Chew met Trump in Mar-a-Lago after his electoral victory in November and later attended his inauguration ceremony. Trump has said he wants to find a compromise with the Chinese company that complies with the spirit rather than the letter of law, even floating an idea of TikTok being jointly owned. ""What I'm thinking of saying to someone is buy it and give half to the US, half, and we'll give you a permit,"" he said recently during a news conference about artificial intelligence. And he also said he would be open to selling the app to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, as well as billionaire Elon Musk, who leads the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency.  Previous names linked with buying TikTok include billionaire Frank McCourt and Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon's Den. The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also claimed he is in the running after a number of investors contacted him after he posted on social media that he was interested."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2l1y73mz1o","Scientists work on 'superhuman' vision systems for robots",2025-02-14,"Chris Baraniuk","Technology Reporter","If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke. But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot. Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.  ""The whole building got triggered,"" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. ""My student called me. He was very surprised."" The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system. Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain – or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons. But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors. However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves. Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.  But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.  An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information. ""What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision – to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,"" explains Prof Zhao. He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building. Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms. Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light. Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections. The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles. Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light. ""It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,"" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms. One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device. However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations. ""That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,"" says Prof Reinhard. ""I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar."" But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology. ""We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,"" he says. He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and ""listens"" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit. Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives. Radio waves can even ""fingerprint"" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved. Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example. Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. ""This wavelength is particularly unexplored,"" says Dr Olivieri. It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure. But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent. ""Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,"" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says. And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people. ""Maybe radar sounds scary – but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,"" he says."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cednp178dwdo","Erasing Escobar: Will Colombia ban the sale of memorabilia of the drug lord?",2025-02-13,"Catherine Ellis","Business reporter","A proposed law in Colombia's Congress seeks to ban the sale of merchandise that celebrates former drug lord Pablo Escobar, whose cocaine cartel has been linked to thousands of murders. One day in 1989, Gonzalo Rojas was at school in the Colombian capital of Bogota when a teacher pulled him out of class to deliver some devastating news. His father, also called Gonzalo, had died in a plane crash that morning. ""I remember leaving and seeing my mum and grandma waiting for me, crying,"" says Mr Rojas, who was just 10-years-old at the time. ""It was a very, very sad day."" Minutes after take off, an explosion on board Avianca flight 203 killed the 107 passengers and crew, as well as three people on the ground who were hit by falling debris. The blast wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate bomb attack by Pablo Escobar and his Medellín cartel. While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombia's past, Escobar's legacy has not. The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos. In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors. But a proposed law in Colombia's Congress is seeking to change this. The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals  - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings. ""Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,"" says Juan Sebastián Gómez, Congress member and co-author of the bill. The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses. Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods. ""This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,"" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medellín. Medellín, Escobar's hometown, was known as ""the most dangerous city in the world"" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict. Today it's been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar. ""This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,"" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter. Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%. If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock. ""We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,"" explains Congressman Gómez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad. Some of the T-shirts, sold for around £5, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - ""silver or lead?"".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed. Shop assistant María Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical. ""We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,"" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items. Escobar and his Medellín cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine. He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population. Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment. ""It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,"" says Mr Rojas. Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education. Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words ""Pablo, President"". ""It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,"" he says. ""There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is."" Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.co in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items. But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world. In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. Gómez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress. ""In Germany you don't sell Hitler T-shirts or swastikas. In Italy you don't sell Mussolini stickers, and you don't go to Chile and get a copy of Pinochet's ID card. ""I think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country - a conversation that hasn't happened yet."" Medellín's mayor  - who was also a presidential candidate in the 2022 elections - has publicly backed the bill, calling the merchandise ""an insult to the city, the country and the victims"". In El Poblado, an upmarket area of Medellín popular with tourists, three Americans browse a stall brimming with souvenirs. One buys a cap with Escobar's name and face printed on the front. He says he wants a memento of ""history"". But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe? Italy's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans ""don't take our cars"". Or as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: ""Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult"". Add cost to the question, and it becomes obvious why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK. ""We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles."" Mr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. ""They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,"" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon. Yet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has ""millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others"". In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth €36bn ($37bn; £30bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for €5.2bn. This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump. ""Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,"" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US – currently - charges on cars imported from the EU. These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers. Trump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war. Trump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. ""So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,"" NBC News recently reported him as saying. In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. ""If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,"" he says. The automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to ""manufacture close to where the customer is based"". As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe. US carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009. Meanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010. After years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models. Ford plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce. Elon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow. Europe is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. ""You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well."" He also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy. ""There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,"" explains Mr Asumendi. He adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars. Adding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages. Mr Palmer does not think ""European customers have any particular objections to American cars"", and Mr Asumendi agrees. ""I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,"" he says. Mr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this. Not least, he says, since tariffs tend to ""insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive"". ""It's not about trade,"" adds Mr Palmer. ""It's about investment and collaboration."""

Bennett's maiden ODI century came in only his seventh game. Ireland skipper Paul Stirling is the youngest player to have notched an ODI 150 by dint of his 177 against Canada in 2010 when he was aged 20 years and four days. After Andrew Balbirnie was dismissed from the first ball of Ireland's reply, Stirling's 32 and Curtis Campher's 44 helped the tourists regroup to 109-2 only for them to slump to 169-6. A 73-run partnership between George Dockrell (34) and Andy McBrine (32) moved Ireland to within 60 runs of the target, but they were both dismissed by Blessing Muzarabani in the space of four balls in the 45th over to effectively end Irish hopes. Richard Ngarava, who had taken Balbirnie's wicket, mopped up the Ireland tail as Matthew Humphreys and Josh Little departed for the addition of only three more runs. Harry Tector (39) and Lorcan Tucker (31) also got starts for the Irish but none of their batters scored sufficiently to put Zimbabwe's target under serious threat. Muzarabani was the pick of the Zimbabwe bowlers as he finished with 4-51, while Ngarava took 3-56 and Wesley Madhevere dismissed Tector and Mark Adair. The three-match ODI series continues in Harare on Sunday with game two before Tuesday's concluding contest. Ireland's Zimbabwe tour, which began with their Test victory in Bulawayo, will then end with a three-match T20 series in Harare. Ireland seamer Barry McCarthy has been ruled out of the white-ball contests because of an abdominal injury and has been replaced by Jordan Neill for the remaining ODIs, with Fionn Hand drafted into the T20 squad.

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz9e8gdvz89o",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Football Association of Wales (FAW) has admitted defeat in its attempt to change rules around international eligibility. Welsh football's governing body had proposed a new residency rule that would have allowed players to play for a home nation after five years at a club in that country. But the plan has been deemed a ""non-starter"" after initial discussions with the respective football associations of England, Northern Ireland and Scotland failed to gain enough support. The FAW has not commented publicly, but chief executive Noel Mooney said on social media the plan was ""not happening"", external. The current agreement between the home nations allows players to represent England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales if they have had five years of continuous education up to the age of 18 in that country, as well as via birthplace or the birthplace of a parent or grandparent. The FAW suggestion was to align the home nations with the rest of Fifa regarding residency, with senior men's head coach Craig Bellamy aware of the plans and former Swansea City captain Matt Grimes targeted as a potential Wales call-up. The plan attracted criticism from fans on social media and was branded ""ridiculous"" by former Wales international Nathan Blake. Another ex-Wales striker, Iwan Roberts, told the Feast of Football podcast: ""I'm happy the idea hasn't taken off. Are we going down the line of rugby? I think it makes a mockery of it. I don't think there's anything wrong with how players now qualify."" The failure of the international eligibility idea comes as Mooney faces up to two other unsuccessful proposals since the turn of the year, with bids to open a European spot up for Wales' EFL clubs and an attempt to lure non-league Merthyr Town into the Welsh system both failing. On the European qualification idea, known as Prosiect Cymru, Mooney said last week he was keen to remain ambitious. ""It would definitely have enhanced Welsh football so I'm not apologising to nobody for trying to do the best thing for Welsh football,"" Mooney told BBC Sport Wales . On the eligibility attempt, Mooney added on social media: ""You will see we will keep exploring ways to be better or grow our game."""

The Japanese carmakers, along with junior partner Mitsubishi, had aimed to combine their businesses to fight back against competition from rival firms, especially in China. The merger would have created an auto group worth $60bn (£48bn), and the world's fourth-largest by vehicle sales after Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai. The companies said they would continue their partnership on electric vehicles. Karl Brauer, an analyst from online research platform iSeeCars.com, said the failure of the merger was not a total surprise. ""Plenty of automotive mergers have not worked out, and this one had as much potential for disaster as it did to help both brands,"" he added. The planned tie-up was seen as providing Nissan, which for a while was Japan's second-largest car company, with crucial relief following years of slowing sales and turmoil involving its top executives. Honda entered negotiations in a leading position. It remains a popular brand globally, producing and selling more cars than Nissan. Nissan, meanwhile, has struggled to recover from a leadership crisis since the arrest of former chief executive and chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018. Mr Ghosn was dismissed from his post over allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies, and has lived as a fugitive in his home country of Lebanon after being smuggled out of Japan in a music equipment box. Nissan announced cost-cutting measures last year, including shedding 9,000 jobs globally, and halving its current chief executive's pay. Honda's boss Toshihiro Mibe had said any merger would be ""based on the assumption that Nissan completes its turnaround action"". The companies eventually disagreed on what role Nissan would play in the merger - equal partner or subsidiary. Jesper Koll, from Japanese online trading platform operator Monex Group, said the  ""pressure to make it appear like a merger of equals in Japan is very strong"". ""Having somebody leading this would seem almost offensive to the other party."" Mr Koll also said Honda could have come off worse, adding: ""You're taking a potentially great company and taxing it with having to bail out an ugly duckling."" Both Nissan and Honda are also facing the prospect of tariffs in the United States, another major market. The growing electric car market has been increasingly dominated by Chinese manufacturers, such as BYD. This increased competition has left many of the world's leading carmakers struggling to compete. In March last year, months before they announced the merger plans, Nissan and Honda had agreed to explore a strategic partnership for electric vehicles. ""The talks started because we believe that we must build up capabilities to fight them, including the current emerging forces, by 2030,"" Honda's chief executive Toshihiro Mibe said, in reference to the Chinese competition. ""Otherwise we will be beaten."" Without the possibility of a Honda merger to ease its troubles, Nissan continues to face an uncertain road ahead. A possible powerful investor has already emerged, however, with Taiwan's Foxconn, which produces most of the world's advanced computer chips, saying it will consider buying Nissan shares for ""co-operation"". Foxconn chairman Young Liu said the firm was interested in collaborating with Renault, the French car giant that has a 36% stake in Nissan after rescuing it from the brink of bankruptcy in 1999. Renault chimed in on the Honda-Nissan fallout on Thursday, calling the terms of the proposed deal ""unacceptable"". Any future deal for Nissan, according to the analyst Karl Brauer, will need to rely on leadership ""that can identify and execute synergies across both companies, as well as manage the political and cultural challenges""."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w5q8qn59yo","Trump's Gaza plan will be seen as flying in face of international law",2025-02-05,"Tom Bateman","BBC State Department Correspondent, Washington","When US President Donald Trump began speaking 10 days ago of Gaza as a demolition site, calling to ""clean out that whole thing"", it wasn't clear how far these were off-the-cuff remarks.  But in the lead up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit, in his Oval Office comments before the meeting, and in the press conference itself, it's now clear he is profoundly serious about his proposals.  They amount to the most radical upending in the established US position on Israel and the Palestinians in the recent history of the conflict; and will be seen as flying in the face of international law.  As well as how the announcement will be absorbed by ordinary people on the ground, it could also have a significant impact on the more immediate phased ceasefire and hostage release process, at a critical juncture. Trump and his officials are framing his call to - in his language - permanently ""resettle"" all Palestinians out of Gaza as a humanitarian gesture, saying there is no alternative for them because Gaza is a ""demolition site"". Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations are strictly prohibited, and Palestinians as well as Arab nations will see this as nothing short of a clear proposal aimed at their expulsion and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land. That's why Arab leaders have already categorically rejected his ideas, made with increasing frequency over the last 10 days, when he suggested Egypt and Jordan could ""take"" Palestinians from Gaza. In a statement on Saturday, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League said that such a move could ""threaten the region's stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples"". It has long been a desire of the ultranationalist far right in Israel to expel Palestinians from the occupied territories and expand Jewish settlements in their place.  Since the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, these groups – leaders of whom have been part of Netanyahu's coalition – have demanded the war against Hamas continues indefinitely, vowing ultimately to re-establish Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip.  They have continued their calls and opposed the current ceasefire and hostage release deal. In his White House press conference with the Israeli prime minister, Trump went further even than his recent growing calls for the Palestinians in Gaza to be ""relocated"" to Egypt and Jordan, saying that the United States would then take the territory over and rebuild it.  When asked whether Palestinians would be allowed back, he said ""the world's people"" would live there, saying it would be an ""international, unbelievable place"", before adding ""also Palestinians"".  His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff earlier in the day summed up much of the tone around the proposal, saying of Trump ""this guy knows real estate"".  Trump said it would be the ""Riviera of the Middle East"".  Asked whether American troops would be involved in the take over of Gaza, Mr Trump said ""we'll do what is necessary"". His proposals amount to the most radical transformation in the US position on the territory since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the war of 1967, which saw the start of Israel's military occupation of land including the Gaza Strip.  Gaza was already home to Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes in the wars surrounding Israel's creation.  They and their descendants make up the vast majority of Gaza's population to this day.  Trump's proposals, if enacted, would involve that population, now more than two million people, being forced elsewhere in the Arab world or even beyond, says Trump, to ""resettle… permanently"".  The proposals would wipe out the possibility of a future two-state solution in any conventional sense and will be categorically rejected by Palestinians and the Arab world as an expulsion plan.  Much of Netanyahu's political base and the ultranationalist settler movement in Israel will champion President Trump's words, seeing them as the fulfilment of a means as Netanyahu puts it to stop ""Gaza being a threat to Israel"".  For ordinary Palestinians, it would amount to a mass act of collective punishment.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx977lrdl1o","With Trump's tariffs looming - will countries scramble to cut deals?",2025-02-11,"João da Silva","Business reporter","A decision by US President Donald Trump to place a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports has left some of the US's major trade partners scrambling to make a deal.  The US is a major steel importer, importing nearly a quarter of the steel it uses, according to data from the American Iron and Steel Institute, which adds that its dependence on aluminium is even greater.  Its neighbours Canada and Mexico, as well as some allies in Asia are among its main suppliers. Trump has said his latest tariffs will take effect on 12 March ""without exceptions or exemptions"". With just over a month to go before the tax kicks in, here is how some countries have responded. As one of the largest suppliers of both commodities to the US, Canada has a lot to lose. ""Canada has extra reasons for irritation as they are the largest steel supplier and one of the largest aluminum suppliers to the US,"" says Deborah Elms, a trade expert with the Hinrich Foundation. Canada's industry minister François-Philippe Champagne has slammed the decision, calling it ""totally unjustified"".  In a post on X, he said Canadian steel is being used in key US industries including defence, shipbuilding and energy, adding that this made ""North America more competitive and secure"".  He added that Canada would ""defend our industries as we have always done and always will"" and warned that Canada's response would be ""clear and calibrated"". Though Trump has said he will not consider any exceptions, it seems like he may set this rule aside for Australia. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken on the phone with Trump and that the US leader was considering an exemption.  Calling Albanese ""a very fine man"", Trump had earlier explained that the US runs a trade surplus with Australia.  ""The reason is they buy a lot of airplanes. They're rather far away and they need lots of airplanes,"" Trump said. ""We actually have a surplus, it's one of the only countries which we do."" But despite being the world's largest exporter of iron ore - a key steelmaking raw material - Australia's exports of steel itself are not as significant. According to Albanese, Australian steel accounts for about 1% of US imports, though its steel is used by a major US military shipbuilder.  The UK has said the government ""will take a considered approach"" and will speak with the US about the details but wants to be clear it will be working in the national interest. However, the BBC understands the UK will not retaliate immediately, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said she ""strongly believe[s] that a deal can be done"". The trade body UK Steel has said in a statement that the tariffs would deliver a ""devastating blow"" to their industry.  ""The US is our second-largest export market after the EU. At a time of shrinking demand and high costs, rising protectionism globally, particularly in the US, will stifle our exports and damage over £400m ($494m) worth of the steel sector's contribution to the UK's balance of trade,"" Gareth Stace,  UK Steel's director general, said in a statement.   ""It is deeply disappointing if President Trump sees the need to target UK steel, given our relatively small production volumes compared to major steel nations,"" he said, adding that there was a danger that other countries could ""redirect"" steel to the UK market to avoid US tariffs.  On Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded by saying ""unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered"".  ""They will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures. The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,"" she said. ""I deeply regret the US decision to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports. Tariffs are taxes - bad for business, worse for consumers.""  According to trade group Eurometal, the US was the second-largest market for EU exports of iron and steel. Trump imposed tariffs on both the UK and the EU during his first term but those restrictions were later relaxed by the Biden administration. India's Steel Secretary Sandeep Poundrik has reportedly claimed that Trump's tariffs will not have much of an impact, pointing to the fact that India exports only a small fraction of its steel to the US.  ""How much steel do we actually export to the US?"" Poundrik said at an industry event, according to a PTI report.  ""We produced 145 million tonnes of steel last year, of which 95,000 tonnes was exported to the US. So, how does it matter if out of 145 million tonnes, you are not able to export 95,000 tonnes?""  But not everyone shares this sentiment.  The chief of the Indian Steel Association (ISA), Naveen Jindal, has said he is ""deeply concerned"" that US restrictions could lead steel makers to dump their steel in the Indian market at lower prices.  These tariffs are ""expected to slash steel exports to the US by 85%, creating a massive surplus that will likely flood India which is one of the few major markets without trade restrictions"", he claimed. South Korea is a major steel exporter to the US, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Its steel is used by homegrown firms like Hyundai, Kia, Samsung and LG, all of which have factories in the US and Mexico. On Tuesday, Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo said South Korea would ""actively consider"" whether there was room for negotiation with the US - a day after the industry ministry held an emergency meeting with steelmakers. In 2018, when Trump similarly imposed a 25% tariff on all steel imports, Seoul was granted a waiver in exchange for a yearly import quota.  It's unclear what deals might actually be cut or waivers granted over the next month, but Eswar Prasad, an international trade policy expert at Cornell University, says in the long run, US trading partners may seek to diversify away from the US by selling their products elsewhere. But he also says that ""Trump's drastic actions have put the rest of the world on the back foot"" because of the US economy's strength relative to most of its trading partners. Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, says that while the US's trading partners may seek appeasement in the short term, they could still decide to hit back in the long run. ""While overtures may be made to work with the Trump team to avert the tariffs, our partners may conclude that tariffs are coming so fast and furious, negotiations are not a durable option,"" she says."

The walk-outs this month were planned at the University of Sheffield's International College in the city centre, which is run by education providers Study Group. Changes in overseas student recruitment were cited as a reason for jobs being put at risk. The University and College Union (UCU) branch chair, Dr Sam Morecroft, said staff had either taken voluntary redundancy or been redeployed. He added that strikes planned for March would go ahead if there was no guarantee that compulsory redundancies would be avoided. The college teaches international students hoping to gain entry to courses at the university. It is based in a university building and uses the same branding, but the Study Group holds a 10-year contract to run it. The union claimed that Study Group employees were treated differently to university staff and faced the prospect of compulsory redundancy rather than voluntary severance agreements. Last year, 36 staff in the student support and academic teaching teams were told they were at risk of redundancy, and four of those were still at risk until accepting trial redeployments on Tuesday.  Dr Morecroft said the provider should be ""ashamed"" that its long-serving staff were being ""forced out onto picket lines"" and said union members had been pressured to take on roles and scheduled into ""rushed"" job interviews. Study Group said the cuts were necessary because of a fall in student numbers. ""Like many universities and higher education providers, we need to adapt staffing to recent changes in international recruitment,"" it said. ""Regrettably at Sheffield this means reducing employee numbers.  ""As educators, we welcome the decision to suspend the strikes and avoid detriment to our students' education.""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vp4dp90qqo","Coca-Cola says it may use more plastic due to Trump tariffs",2025-02-12,"João da Silva","Business reporter","Coca-Cola may have to sell more drinks in plastic bottles in the US if President Donald Trump's tariffs end up making aluminium cans more expensive, the company's chief executive, James Quincey, said in a call with investors. It comes after Trump ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US, which could end up driving up the price of canned food and drink items in the country. In December, the beverage giant scaled down its sustainability target of using 50% recycled materials in its packaging by 2030, to using 35% to 40% by 2035. Environmental groups have labelled Coca-Cola as the ""top global plastic polluter"" for six consecutive years.  ""If one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,"" Quincey said.  ""For example, if aluminium cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles"". The Coca-Cola boss also sought to minimise the impact of the tariffs on his business saying packaging is only a relatively small component of his company's costs.  In recent years, Coca-Cola had been selling more products in aluminium containers as part of its marketing and sustainability strategies. Despite being generally more expensive, aluminium cans are also a lot more recyclable than plastic bottles over time. The US imports almost half of the aluminium it uses, according to the United States Geological Survey, so a 25% tariff on all imports is likely to cause cans to become even more costly. After Trump first ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won ""exclusions"" from those import taxes. But this time, Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules either for individual products or for particular countries. In a separate move that is likely to contribute to plastic pollution, Trump signed an executive order earlier this week ending a US government effort to replace plastic straws with paper. The order reversed a measure signed by former President Joe Biden, who had called plastic pollution a ""crisis"". "

The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message. ""It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,"" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia. The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell. ""I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,"" he says. Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media. Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut. ""Kindness is cool,"" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.  Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money. ""I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story… and often the people who have the least give the most,"" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers. Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product. The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular? Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments. ""Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content."" On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism? """"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,"" says Ms Cleary.  Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out. ""I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,"" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as ""in need"". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.  She argues the participant is being ""lured"" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.  Only if they do that are they rewarded. ""I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,"" asks Ms Burke. The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy. ""I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,"" says Mr Weidenhofer. And how about filming people without their consent? ""If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,"" says Mr Weidenhofer. But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him ""feel weird"". Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.  Mr Dereniowski realised that this might be an issue when he raised $240,000 overnight for a father and son who were living in their car.  After that, more thought goes into longer term help. ""We've started setting up financial advisors. We've started getting these people jobs. We've helped allocate the funds properly to pay off their debt, their car, helping them get a home and [pay their] rent,"" he says.

A sale process has been launched for Fairline Yachts, based in Oundle, Northamptonshire. The administrators said they were trying to attract both domestic and international investors. They said the funding would help them retain the firm's 250 employees. Fairline Yachts was founded in 1967 and has a network of dealers worldwide for its range of luxury yachts. In December, the private equity firm Hanover Investors sold its stake in the company, which was then acquired by Arrowbolt. Following the takeover, more than 100 employees were made redundant. The lender, DF Capital, has provided the funding needed to continue production and sale and retain 250 employees across sites in Oundle and Suffolk. The administrators are now encouraging interested parties to contact them about the possibility of buying Fairline Yachts. Michael Magnay, one of the joint administrators, said: ""The business is known throughout the world for the quality of its craftsmanship and the innovative design of its yachts.  ""We expect that it could have broad appeal, to international investors as well as domestic.

Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid. ""There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',"" says Elena Mirón, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city. ""But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love."" Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub. And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year. By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%. This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy. ""The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,"" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year. Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year. ""We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,"" he adds. That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to €163bn by 2026 ($169bn; £136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy. Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses. ""Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,"" says María Jesús Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School. Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, ""is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism"". Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%. Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage. At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called ""Iberian exception"", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills. Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil. ""Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks – including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,"" he said.  ""And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms."" The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU. The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area. ""[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,"" he says. ""There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy."" Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008. Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this. This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation. Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population. The Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as ""fundamental"". The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon. The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern. Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output. María Jesús Valdemoros warns that this is ""an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability"". In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation. With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for Sánchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth."

""Let's rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it's a penny at a time,""  Trump's post said, describing the move as a cost-cutting measure.  It comes after Elon Musk's unofficial Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) drew attention to the cost of minting pennies in a post on X last month. The debate over the cost and usefulness of pennies has been a long-running one in the US. ""This is so wasteful,"" Trump's Truth Social post said. ""I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies."" According the US Mint's 2024 annual report, making and distributing a one cent coin costs 3.69 cents. US government officials and members of  Congress have in the past proposed discontinuing the penny without success. While its detractors have argued that the zinc and copper coin is a waste of money and resources, those who support it say that the coin keeps prices lower and boosts fund-raising for charities.  Other countries have discontinued similar coins. Canada ditched its one-cent coin in 2012 citing the cost of minting it and its falling purchasing power due to higher prices. The declining use of cash meant the UK did not mint any new coins in 2024, after officials decided there were already enough coins in circulation. The UK Treasury has said that 1p or 2p coins are not being scrapped, but with more people living cashless lives, there have been several years when no 2p coins were produced. 20p coins have also seen various periods without new minting."

John Row, who lives in Gloucester, made the attempt at Marrakech International Storytelling Festival alongside 100 other storytellers from 33 countries. The group achieved 80 hours and 34 minutes of uninterrupted storytelling on 24 January at Jemaa El-Fnaa Square. Reflecting on the success, Mr Row said: ""It was a mixture of elation and relief because everybody put so much effort into this."" Mr Row, who is the artistic director and curator of the festival, said the team were at a gala dinner, hosted to mark the end of the festival, when the news of the achievement broke. ""It was a huge celebration and the Moroccans did this fantastic chant. It was phenomenal,"" he said. Mr Row said the world record was rather ""complicated"", with a number of rules they had to adhere to - such as making sure they had at least 10 audience members at any one time. ""If someone had been on, it was four hours before the same person could go on again. The most you were allowed was a five-minute break and of course, we had to stop for calls of prayer, because we were doing it in public,"" he said. Mr Row said the festival began after building a ""community"" of storytellers online during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""It [storytelling] was dying but I don't like to call it a revival, I think of it more as a resuscitation,"" he added. Mr Row said Marrakech was chosen as the festival's location because it has a ""1,000-year tradition of storytelling"". ""The festival began as a mix between a festival and a gathering,"" he added. He also highlighted the support the festival had received since its inception, including receiving a patronage from King Muḥammad VI and the tourist industry. On how to tell a good story, Mr Row said: ""Rabbit non-stop and listen continuously. ""You can't harm a story. My friends says - the only harm you can do to a story is not to tell it.

Beijing announced the plan on 4 February, minutes after new US levies of 10% on all Chinese products came into effect. On Sunday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US, with a full announcement to come on Monday.  Speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to the Super Bowl, he also said he was planning reciprocal tariffs on other nations - but did not specify which ones would be targeted.  China's latest tariffs on US goods include a 15% border tax on imports of US coal and liquefied natural gas products. There is also a 10% tariff on American crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars.  Last week, Chinese authorities launched an anti-monopoly probe into technology giant Google, while PVH, the US owner of designer brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, was added to Beijing's so-called ""unreliable entity"" list. China has also imposed export controls on 25 rare metals, some of which are key components for many electrical products and military equipment. Trump's announcement over the weekend of plans to impose a 25% tax on the US's steel and aluminium imports comes days after he reached deals with Canada and Mexico to avoid 25% tariffs that he had threatened on all goods from the countries. He introduced similar measures during his first term as president, imposing 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminium, but later granted several trading partners duty-free quotas - including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The European Union (EU) import taxes were not resolved until the Biden administration took over the White House.  There was no mention on Sunday of which countries, if any, would be granted similar exemptions if these new tariffs are implemented in the following days.  Trump’s intention to implement reciprocal tariffs would fulfil an election campaign pledge to levy tariffs at the same rates that are imposed on US goods. He also said import taxes for vehicles remained on the table after reports he was considering exemptions to universal tariffs. Trump has repeatedly complained that EU tariffs on imports of American cars are much higher than US levies. Last week, Trump told the BBC tariffs on EU goods could happen ""pretty soon"" - but suggested a deal could be ""worked out"" with the UK. The day after the latest US tariffs came into effect, Beijing accused Washington of making ""unfounded and false allegations"" about its role in the trade of the synthetic opioid fentanyl to justify the move. In a complaint lodged with the World Trade Organization (WTO), China said the US import taxes were ""discriminatory and protectionist"" and violated trade rules. But experts have warned China is unlikely to secure a ruling in its favour as the WTO panel that settles disputes remains unable to function. Trump had been expected to speak to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in recent days but the US president has said he was in no hurry to hold talks. ""China is much better prepared [than during Trump's first term],"" said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Although their economy cyclically has slowed down quite a bit, their technology capabilities are a lot greater than they were before and they have diversified their trade and investment with others"". Some of the many measures brought in by Trump since he took office on 20 January have been subject to change. On Friday, he suspended tariffs on small packages from China, which, along with the additional 10% tariffs, came into effect on 4 February. The suspension will stay in place until ""adequate systems are in place to fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue"". After the order ended duty-free treatment of shipments worth less than $800 (£645) the US Postal Service (USPS) and other agencies scrambled to comply. USPS temporarily stopped accepting packages from China, only to U-turn a day later."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-11809908",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The International Criminal Court (ICC) is a global court with the power to bring prosecutions for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  US President Donald Trump has announced sanctions against the court, which he accuses of ""illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel"". The court, based in the Dutch city of The Hague, was established in 2002 to hold rogue leaders responsible for atrocities to account.  World leaders had increasingly pushed for its creation in the wake of the Yugoslav wars and the Rwandan Genocide. It is a court of last resort, intervening only when national authorities cannot, or will not, prosecute. It can only deal with crimes committed after 1 July 2002, when the Rome Statute - which established the court - came into force. The Rome Statute has been ratified by 125 countries, including the UK and many European nations. More than 30 others have signed and may ratify it in the future. However, the US and Israel are not members of the ICC. In November, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Judges at the court said there were ""reasonable grounds"" that Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif bore ""criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity"".  Israel denies the claims. Deif was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year. The US sanctions against the ICC were announced while Netanyahu was visiting Washington DC. The White House said the ICC had created a ""shameful moral equivalency"" between Hamas and Israel. ICC condemns US sanctions and vows to continue 'providing justice' Arrest warrants issued for Netanyahu, Gallant and Hamas commander Trump's executive order said the ICC's recent actions ""set a dangerous precedent"" that endangered Americans by exposing them to ""harassment, abuse and possible arrest"". The US has repeatedly accused the ICC of placing constraints on Israel's right to self-defence, while ignoring Iran and anti-Israel groups. Former US President Joe Biden also criticised the ICC's warrant for Netanyahu, calling the move ""outrageous"". The sanctions place financial and visa restrictions on individuals and their families who assist in ICC investigations of American citizens or allies. They ""have the potential of freezing property and assets, as well as suspending entry into the United States of ICC officials and their immediate family members,"" Zachary Kaufman, the former clerk to the court's first chief prosecutor, told the BBC World Service. Following Trump's executive order, the ICC said it ""stands firmly"" by its personnel and would continue to provide ""justice and hope"", adding the order seeks to harm its ""independent and impartial"" work. During negotiations to establish the ICC, the US argued that its soldiers might be the subject of politically motivated or frivolous prosecutions. In a much-criticised decision in July 2002, the UN Security Council voted on a compromise that gave US troops a 12-month exemption from prosecution, to be renewed annually. But the Security Council - prompted by then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan - refused to renew the exemption in June 2004, after pictures of US troops abusing Iraqi prisoners shocked the world. The court's operation is seen as weakened without US involvement.  However, Washington has not ruled out co-operation with the court in particular cases.  President Joe Biden ordered US intelligence agencies to share evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine with the court.  Which other countries are not ICC members? A number of important countries are not under the jurisdiction of the ICC.  Some, including China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Turkey, have not signed the treaty. Others, including Israel, Egypt, Iran, and Russia, have signed but have not ratified it. The court's first verdict, in March 2012, was against Thomas Lubanga, the leader of a militia in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  He was convicted of war crimes relating to the use of children in that country's conflict and sentenced in July to 14 years. The highest profile person to be brought to the ICC is Ivory Coast's former President Laurent Gbagbo. He was charged in 2011 with murder, rape, persecution and ""other inhumane acts"", but acquitted of all charges. Among those wanted by the ICC is Joseph Kony, leader of Uganda's rebel movement, the Lord's Resistance Army. He is charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes, including the abduction of thousands of children. The court also has an outstanding arrest warrant for ex-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The ICC has been criticised, particularly by the African Union, for its focus on Africa. However, it denies any bias, pointing to the fact that some cases were self-referred by the country affected, or referred to it by the UN. In 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The court alleges he is responsible for war crimes, and has focused its claims on the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia. The ICC has no police force of its own to track down and arrest suspects.  Instead it must rely on national police services to make arrests and seek their transfer to The Hague. A prosecutor begins an investigation if a case is referred either by the UN Security Council or by a ratifying state. He or she can also take independent action, but prosecutions have to be approved by a panel of judges. Both the prosecutor and the judges are elected by the states taking part in the court.  When a case goes to trial, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. Three judges consider all the evidence and then issue a verdict and, if the accused is found guilty, sentence. States that join the treaty may want to make sure that they themselves are able to prosecute all the crimes that it covers - otherwise the court may intervene. Some governments have already introduced legislation to make changes to their own judicial systems. The states which take part. This is according to the same rules that govern their contributions to the UN - roughly based on their national wealth. The absence of the US in particular makes funding of the court more expensive for others. The UK, Japan, Germany and France are among the the largest contributors."

Adrian Sarchet, known as the Sea Donkey, has called for members of the public to show support for the ""iconic piece of heritage"" at La Vallette Bathing Pools. The government said the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) had served a prohibition notice in relation to the diving board following reports of incidents and near misses. The HSE said the depth of the water under the platform fell below international standards and as a result it would have to be removed.  It said the maximum depth of the water below the diving platform was 2.75m (9ft) which did not meet the 3.2m (10.5ft) minimum depth required by the World Aquatics and British Standards. The States of Guernsey said it considered increasing the depth of the pool, but the estimated £1m cost to do so was ""prohibitive"". It added: ""Even if work was carried out to increase the depth of the pool, regulations from World Aquatics, the UK Health and Safety Executive and Swim England also state that users of any diving platform should be supervised at all times and that the diving area should be segregated from other swimmers.  ""Other options were considered including reducing its height, however, again this would still require continual supervision by lifeguards and segregation of the diving area, which was also considered to be prohibitive due to the cost of hiring the necessary staff."" Mr Sarchet said he understood the board would be removed on Tuesday 11 February. He said ""there was a lack of transparency"" around the decision after only being made aware of the plans on Thursday. ""I hope we can encourage HSE or at least the politicians they answer to, to postpone the planned removal of the diving board on Tuesday 11 February and to engage with the public on the perceived risks and potential solutions that do not involve the destruction of our shared heritage,"" Mr Sarchet said. HSE chief officer Robin Gonard said: ""In light of the assessment we carried out, our decision was that immediate action needs to be taken to ensure compliance with modern safety standards to protect members of our community by avoiding the risk of serious injury or worse.""

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio oversaw the seizure of the plane on Thursday - the second Venezuelan plane the US has confiscated in the Caribbean country in less than a year. US authorities said there were legal grounds for the seizure, ""based on violations of US sanctions, export controls, and money laundering"". The Venezuelan foreign ministry called Rubio ""an aircraft thief"". The US has long imposed a variety of sanctions on Venezuela in response to what it describes as criminality, corruption and repression under the South American nation's leader, Nicolás Maduro. Most recently, it placed financial sanctions on a raft of Venezuelan officials in response to the outcome of a presidential election last year, which saw Maduro re-elected. The US, among others, has contested the official results, which the opposition says were doctored in Maduro's favour. Rubio, a key figure in the new Trump administration, supervised the confiscation of the Dassault Falcon 200 jet on a visit to a military airstrip in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, on the last stop of his Latin American tour. He told reporters on Thursday: ""The message is that when there are sanctions because they are violating human rights, they are violating a whole series of things, travelling to Iran, helping countries that really wish harm to the United States. ""These sanctions are going to be applied and reinforced."" Iran and Venezuela remain allies, with Iran's president Masoud Pezeshkian congratulating Maduro on being sworn in for his third term as president last month, saying ""attempts to threaten and sanction Venezuela"" were ""cruel and doomed to failure"". US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday restoring his ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Iran, which seeks to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons and restricting it economically through sanctions. Dominican Republic authorities detained the aircraft last year after the US said it had violated unilateral US sanctions against Venezuela. Venezuelan officials had used the plane to fly to Greece, Turkey, Russia, Nicaragua and Cuba, and had taken it to the Dominican Republic for maintenance, according to the US state department. The Venezuelan foreign ministry said it would ""take all necessary actions to denounce this theft and demand the immediate return of its aircraft"". In September, the US under then-president Joe Biden, seized the first Venezuelan government plane in the Dominican Republic that had been used to transport President Maduro on international trips."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cj91dr17d1no",NA,NA,NA,NA,"World Athletics is set to introduce a swab test for elite athletes who wish to compete in the women's category at international events. The ""pre-clearance requirement"" is one of several changes that will further tighten regulations concerning the eligibility of transgender and difference of sex development (DSD) athletes. In March 2023 World Athletics banned transgender athletes who had gone through male puberty from competing in the female category in international competition.  However, following recommendations from the World Athletics council, external the governing body is now set to revise its eligibility regulations for male-to-female trans athletes on the basis of fresh evidence it said shows there was a ""significant performance gap before the onset of puberty"". The current rules for DSD athletes, meanwhile, require them to reduce their testosterone levels below 2.5 nmol/L for at least six months to compete in any female category event internationally.  World Athletics has now proposed the rules for both DSD and transgender athletes should be the same because new evidence has ""clarified that testosterone suppression in 46XY DSD, external and 46XY transgender individuals can only ever partly mitigate the overall male advantage"". A World Athletics council meeting next month is expected to determine when the new regulations could be implemented. World Athletics president Lord Coe made ""protecting"" eligibility of the women's category a key component of his bid to be elected International Olympic Committee president. Coe said on Monday the proposed new rules ""keep up with the latest information available"" to maintain ""a fair and level playing field in the female category"". ""Preserving the integrity of competition in the female category is a fundamental principle of the sport of athletics and we look forward to this collaborative consultation process with our key stakeholders in this area,"" he added. World Athletics said the cheek swab test would look for the SRY gene, which is ""almost always on the male Y chromosome"" and ""is used as a highly accurate proxy for biological sex"". A dry spot blood test could also be used to determine an athlete's testosterone levels, in addition to the presence of the SRY gene. There have been calls for mandatory sex testing at the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 2028 via swab checks, but there has been disagreement among scientists as to their effectiveness. Professor Alun Williams, who researches genetic factors related to sport performance at the Manchester Metropolitan University Institute of Sport, told BBC Sport last year that a cheek swab alone would ""not allow you to reach a robust conclusion on someone's sex and potential advantage in sport"". The proposals developed by a World Athletics working group on gender diverse athletes will now go through a consultation period from 10 February until 5 March. However, the views of athletes will only be heard during this time and alternative policy proposals to the one outlined are not being sought."

Andrew Bailey told the BBC he was ""following extremely closely"" whether the Trump administration will change its support for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Sources in Washington said the two institutions were caught by a White House executive order for a review of United Nations (UN) and other international organisations. Mr Bailey said it is ""very important that we don't have a fragmentation of the world economy"". He said ""a big part of that is that we have support and engagement in the multilateral institutions, institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, that support the operation of the world economy. That's really important."" There is growing concern in finance ministries and central banks around the world about US disengagement from the institutions, with radical changes to the global financial system now being floated in Washington DC. The ""Project 2025"" suggested blueprint for Trump's presidency, which was authored by figures who are now key White House staff, recommended withdrawal from both institutions and termination of financial contributions. It said the institutions ""espouse economic theories and policies that are inimical to American principles of free market and limited government principles."" Following a White House executive order, all international intergovernmental organisations of which the US is a member will be reviewed to determine if they are ""contrary to the interests of the US"" and ""can be reformed"". The six month review may then provide recommendations for withdrawal to President Trump. Sources in the G20, or Group of Twenty -  a club of countries that meets to discuss global economic and political issues - said that during his first term, Trump's team suggested abolishing the IMF at the 2018 Buenos Aires Summit. The IMF and World Bank are specialised agencies of the UN. The US is the largest shareholder in both the Fund and the Bank, institutions which were created by the post-war Bretton Woods Conference 80 years ago. The IMF provides last resort lending for nations in financial trouble, and surveys economic problems. The World Bank gives money and cheap loans to developing countries for poverty alleviation and development. The Trump administration is yet to appoint staff to this area, but USAID's development spending is currently the focus of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency cuts. Some members of the administration are believed to be particularly focused on the World Bank's loans to China. Asked about the possibility of the US leaving the Fund, the IMF said yesterday it had a ""long history"" of ""working with successive US administrations""."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2q13113wwo","Experts warn of threat to global health as US freezes overseas aid",2025-02-08,"Philippa Roxby, Smitha Mundasad & Dominic Hughes","BBC News","Experts in global health have been expressing their dismay and concern over the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which distributes tens of billions of dollars' worth of overseas aid every year. President Donald Trump's administration has announced huge cuts to the agency's workforce and the immediate suspension of almost all of its aid programmes. The US government has announced a 90-day freeze on funding for aid projects while it undertakes a ""review"" to ensure they align with President Trump's priorities. Trump is a long-term critic of overseas spending and has said it needs to be brought into line with his ""America First"" strategy. The administration has targeted USAID in particular, saying the agency's spending is totally unexplainable and has singled out certain projects as examples of how the agency is, in its view, wasting taxpayers' money.  Health experts, on the other hand, have warned of the spread of disease, as well as delays to the development of vaccines and new treatments as a result of the cuts. As well as directly running many health programmes, USAID funds other organisations to carry out work on its behalf, and the freeze in funding has caused confusion among these groups too. Waivers for the funding freeze have been issued for some humanitarian programmes, but the announcement has already caused widespread disruption to services. Dr Tom Wingfield, an expert in tuberculosis (TB) and social medicine at the UK's Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, told the BBC it is hard to underplay the impact of the decision to dismantle USAID.  ""People don't appreciate the extent and reach of USAID. It goes towards under-nutrition, hygiene, toilets, access to clean water, which all have a massive impact on TB and diarrhoeal diseases. ""Diseases don't respect borders - that's even more the case where we have climate change and mass movement of people. Infectious diseases will spread."" Dr Wingfield says TB kills 1.3 million people per year and makes a further 10 million people ill. But four out of 10 people never receive any care and can therefore transmit the disease, he said. ""Whether it's a research project or a clinic affected, then we run risk of further transmission. ""People will die directly because of cuts in US funding."" It's not just TB clinics that are at risk, but those providing care for people living with HIV. Much of this work is done by non-governmental organisations, NGOs, who provide vital anti-retroviral medicines which can suppress the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, which helps prevent sexual transmission to other people. Dr Wingfield says if treatment is disrupted, there could be serious problems.  ""People with controlled HIV, if they miss meds, the virus in their blood increases and there's a risk of onwards transmission. ""There is a risk of undoing all the progress to date."" Frontline AIDS is a UK and South Africa-based organisation that works with 60 partners across 100 countries. More than 20 of their partners have said they are affected by the US foreign aid freeze. Communication around the freeze and subsequent waiver has caused ""deep confusion"", the organisation told the BBC. Many partners have had to suspend HIV care, treatment and prevention to vulnerable children and adults and lay off staff, it said. ""The majority remain in limbo and this is having a catastrophic impact on communities and organisations,"" said John Plastow, Executive Director for Frontline AIDS. It reported that one organisation in Uganda has said it will run out of its HIV testing kits, TB medicines and condoms in a month, which are mostly funded by USAID's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief programme. In South Africa, a large number of HIV services have stopped. Some provide aftercare and emergency contraception for women and girls who have been raped. Prof Peter Taylor, director of international development studies at Sussex University, said one of the biggest issues with the freeze was an erosion of trust. ""Stopping things suddenly undermines people's trust. People are bewildered and angry,"" he said. ""The undermining of basic trust is the real cost and that is being magnified in many situations around the world. ""This is so damaging to the US global reputation."" USAID also provides funding for crucial international clinical drug trials, which Prof Thomas Jaki, leader of the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge, fears might now also be vulnerable. ""Unfortunately, there are quite a number of trials that are immediately affected by the USAID freeze - both in terms of running trials but also trials that are in set-up and are planned to start soon."" He said he was ""convinced"" the US funding freeze ""will detrimentally impact treatment development"", to an extent where exciting new treatments are delayed by years or even discarded. ""Clearly the impact in areas such as malaria and HIV will be particularly high as a notable portion of research in these areas is funded via this route,"" Prof Jaki said. Prof Rosa Freedman, professor of international law, conflict and global development at the University of Reading, said USAID provides up to 40% of the world's development aid, which covers health as well as education and developing economic prosperity. But health programmes is where the impact of a funding freeze - if it is prolonged or permanent - is likely to be felt most keenly in the months to come, she warns. ""This will be partly due to the prevention of further vaccines being distributed or funded by USAID. ""This could mean that preventable diseases, which we thought had been contained or even eradicated, could reappear or worsen, such as cholera and malaria."" Prof Freedman said this could lead to a rise in healthcare problems around the world. ""Given the globalised and interdependent nature of our planet, the concern will be that these diseases could spread quickly and far."""

The 31-year-old worked in hospitality for nine years, becoming the general manager for a gastro-pub in Cheshire. But it wasn't the real career for him. ""I felt I could do more,"" he says. Mr Boutflour had been interested in space and aviation from a young age, mentioning Concorde as an early inspiration. A course at Portsmouth University caught his imagination - the UK's first Space Systems Degree Apprenticeship launched in conjunction with BAE Systems. To build up funds to help pay for the course, he switched to lorry driving - a move which did not prepare his social circle for his change of direction. ""Everybody thought I was lying when I said I'd been accepted on this course. They thought I was pulling their leg, going from truck driver to space engineer!"" The four-and-a-half year course involves on-the-job learning at sites where BAE Systems designs and assembles satellites. Back at Portsmouth they'll be studying space systems engineering. The academic side of the course consists of four modules, in thermodynamics, programming, digital systems and maths, all split between lectures and laboratory time. Mr Boutflour is joined by four others on the paid apprenticeship. One of those is Alice Overend. Aged 21, she had already worked on satellite assembly and testing when she applied for the Portsmouth course. This work involved the ill-fated Prometheus 2 satellites that were lost during a failed attempt to launch a satellite into space by Virgin Orbit in 2023. This incident made a deep impression on her. ""It was quite surreal, we were all watching the launch in the office and when the coverage ended we just went home."" Unsuccessful satellite launches are part of life in the space business. But the Virgin Orbit loss stuck in the mind of other Portsmouth students. It stands for the risk element in space work. Ms Overend's background in satellite testing has given her a head-start in terms of understanding how a sprawling UK space industry fits together. ""The whole space sector is going in a good direction."" She explains the true meaning of ""space systems"" in her world. ""Systems is about making sure everything is where it should be, such as the satellite weight being precisely right."" George Smith is the youngest of the group at 18, and joined the course straight from A levels in physics, maths and engineering. In his home town of York he and some friends took apart an old lawn mower to build a go-kart out of the parts. How did the go-kart perform? ""It only wanted to turn to the right, but we learnt a lot about why it wasn't working."" Not everything in space exploration goes to plan either, but practical work like this is an integral part of the course. ""The apprenticeship appealed to me. I find studying and applying the lesson in practice means I learn better. So I was looking at degree apprenticeships and this course was a checklist of everything I wanted to do."" Space is an expanding sector and he harbours a desire to get beyond earth's atmosphere one day ""if I can tick all the right boxes to become an astronaut"". Right now the course is meeting his expectations. ""To say it's a dream come true is cheesy, but I've got in the door."" Elizabeth Seward is the head of space strategy at BAE Systems. Despite her own background as a physicist, Ms Seward thinks people are put off this sector by a perception that it's exclusively for rocket scientists. ""Space tends to get put on a pedestal. But the truth is we need more people from other backgrounds. A career here is for anyone interested in space, such as project managers or lawyers."" The appeal of space is evident at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, where Dr Stephanie Docherty teaches orbital mechanics, how a satellite gets on the right path, as part of the aerospace course. She agrees that specialisation is less important than aptitude in the space sector. ""Employers want a problem solving mind-set. And I have noticed a real appetite from students for more space content in their course."" Proposals to build rocket-launching sites in remote locations such as the Shetland Islands mean more positions should open up in the UK space industry in the very near future. After the grounding of the Space Shuttle in 2011 Mr Boutfleur felt space exploration ""took a step backwards."" Now he says the success of Elon Musk's SpaceX reusable launchers is enormously significant. ""Musk has very much re-ignited the space race"". All three students agree that the hands-on side of the course is inspiring. And outside of the space syllabus what do they get up to? ""Most of us play video games,"" says Mr Smith, with Ms Overend nodding in agreement. Scuba diving is another popular pastime. ""We all like gaming,"" says Mr Boutflour, ""and scuba diving is good training for working in space."""

On Monday, against the sumptuous backdrop of the city's 125-year-old Grand Palais, representatives from 80 countries including world leaders, tech bosses, academics and other experts, will gather for a two-day global summit to discuss current progress, and future goals, for the rapidly-evolving, hugely-disruptive technology that is artificial intelligence. That might be what's on the official agenda of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, but there is something else that's breathing fire into this particular talking shop: DeepSeek. A horse racing fan once told me that the night before a big race, everyone's a winner. And with China dramatically blowing the AI competition in a new direction with DeepSeek, its super-efficient and super-viral AI assistant, suddenly there's a feeling ahead of the summit that the pole position occupied by the US AI sector, despite its vast wealth and AI infrastructure, might not be quite so out-of-reach after all. Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, says there is currently ""a vacuum for global leadership on AI"". Prof Dame Wendy Hall, from Southampton University, agrees. ""DeepSeek made everybody realise that China is a force to be reckoned with,"" says the computer scientist. ""We don't have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue."" On that front, the timing of the summit could not be better. Europe also spies an opportunity to make a new bid for the AI crown. One of French President Emmanuel Macron's officials described the summit to journalists as a ""wake up call"" for France and Europe, adding that the bloc must not let the AI revolution ""pass it by"". Other countries also recognise a potential shifting of AI power in the air. India PM Narendra Modi has confirmed his attendance at this summit – having not come to previous gatherings. The US is sending some serious firepower as a defensive signal of its own, including Vice President JD Vance, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, and Google's Sundar Pichai.  Elon Musk is notably absent from the official guest list, but he will undoubtedly have something to say about it all, whether he's there in person or not. British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is also reportedly staying away. There have been two previous summits, the first held in the UK and the second in South Korea. A lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time, on the steps of the historic mansion of Bletchley House, in November 2023, and promised to try to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks. For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then. In Bletchley Park, China's Vice Minister for Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui attended. But there were whispers that he was kept at arms length, on the grounds of national security. In Paris, by comparison I expect China to be guests of honour. The country is reportedly sending one of its most senior leaders, Ding Xuexiang, a close ally of President Xi JinPing. There's also a buzz around whether DeepSeek creator Liang Wenfeng will join him. I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI's notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut. Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers. But there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms, model climate change solutions, develop new formulas for drugs - and that will all be in scope in Paris. Furthermore, the David v Goliath narrative around which the story of DeepSeek hangs does merit further scrutiny. The boss of AI firm Anthropic, Dario Amodei, has written a compelling blog about whether DeepSeek really was built at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals. We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output ""in the style of"" individual human creators). But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms. There's one more theme running through the AI Summit that will be worth keeping an eye on. The first summit had the word ""safety"" in its title. Some felt the event pushed the narrative too hard and terrified people with dark talk of existential threats. But it hasn't fallen of the agenda entirely. As a subject, AI safety is a rather broad church. It can relate to any number of risks: the generation and spread of misinformation, displays of bias and discrimination against individuals or races, the ongoing development by multiple countries of AI-controlled weapons, the potential for AI to create unstoppable computer viruses. Prof Geoffrey Hinton, often described as one of the Godfathers of AI, says these as ""short-term risks"". They might be up for discussion in Paris, but he argued on BBC Radio 4's Today programme last week that they are unlikely to garner strong international collaboration in the long term. The big scenario which he believes will really pull everyone together is the prospect of AI becoming more intelligent than humans – and wanting to seize control. ""Nobody wants AI to take over from people,"" he says. ""The Chinese would much rather the Chinese Communist Party ran the show than AI."" Prof Hinton compared this eventuality to the height of the Cold War, when the US and Russia ""just about succeeded"" in collaborating in order to prevent global nuclear war. ""There's no hope of stopping [AI development],"" he said. ""What we've got to do is to try to develop it safely."" Prof Max Tegmark, founder of the Future of Life Institute, also shares a stark warning. ""Either we develop an amazing AI tool that helps humans, or uncontrollable AGI [Artificial General Intelligence] that replaces humans,"" he says. ""We are unfortunately closer to building AGI than to figuring out how to control it."" Prof Tegmark hopes the summit will push for binding safety standards ""like we have in every other critical industry""."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cdjdpw0v707o",NA,NA,NA,NA,"First one-day international, Nagpur  England 248 (47.4 overs): Buttler 52, Bethell 51; Jadeja 3-26, Harshit 3-53 India 251-6 (38.4 overs) Gill 87, Iyer 59; Mahmood 2-47 India won by four wickets; lead series 1-0 Scorecard England suffered another disappointing defeat in Brendon McCullum's first one-day international in charge as India won their series opener in Nagpur by four wickets. On the back of a 4-1 loss in the preceding T20 series, Jos Buttler's England wasted a good start with the bat to be bowled out for 248. Opener Phil Salt crashed 43 from 26 balls, including 26 from one Harshit Rana over, but his calamitous run-out began a collapse of three wickets for two runs in eight balls from 71-0. Captain Buttler threatened a successful rebuild before miscuing on 52, leaving Jacob Bethell to bat with the lower order. The 21-year-old left-hander started slowly and had just begun to open his arms when he was pinned lbw for 51. England were dismissed in 47.4 overs. India fell to 19-2 in reply but Shubman Gill stuck a fine 87 from 96 balls to take his side to the brink of victory. They stumbled late on - Gill's dismissal one of three wickets for 14 runs with fewer than 30 needed - but India still completed their chase with 68 balls remaining. The second ODI in the three-match series is on Sunday. After a convincing defeat in the T20s, McCullum now has these three games to turn around England's 50-over side before their Champions Trophy opener against Australia on 22 February. England come into this contest on the back of three consecutive ODI series defeats and this latest loss was littered with familiar struggles - those which have dogged England's 50-over cricket since they won the World Cup at Lord's in 2019. There was a collapse – Salt, Ben Duckett and the out-of-form Harry Brook fell in a flurry – before the loss of regular wickets, including the returning Joe Root for 19, meant they were unable to turn the tide. They were bowled out for the 21st time in 44 ODI innings since the start of 2022. When their turn to bowl came, Jofra Archer conceded only two runs and nicked off Yashasvi Jaiswal in his first three overs but his next two cost 23. Despite Rohit Sharma chipping Saqib Mahmood to mid-wicket for two, India took 71 from the first 10 overs. From there, England's bowling was too often wayward and rarely threatening. Shreyas Iyer capitalised to take 59 from 36 balls and a partnership of 108 between Gill and Axar Patel took India to the brink. Axar was bowled by a fine leg-spinner by Adil Rashid with 28 runs needed, KL Rahul tamely chipped the leg-spinner a return catch and Gill's mis-timed pull went to mid-on. That only made the scoreline closer look closer than it should have. England were well beaten. Little went right for England after they gifted India their breakthrough in the ninth over. After Salt cut behind point, Duckett ambled the first two runs and sent back his partner as he set off for a third. Salt was already mid-pitch and had no chance of recovering before Iyer's return from the deep. Four balls later, Duckett was brilliantly caught by Jaiswal running back at square leg off Harshit, who then had Brook fending a short-ball down the leg side for a three-ball duck. Whereas England were spun out attempting big shots in the T20s, this was more a meek slide. Root went lbw to a quicker one from Ravindra Jadeja before a partnership of 59 between Buttler and Bethell. Buttler accumulated steadily, the England skipper hitting only four fours in his half-century. He could only laugh at his misfortune when he managed to toe-end Axar's long hop to short fine leg. The biggest positive for England was Bethell, who overcame his early struggles to reach a second ODI fifty in 62 balls. But hopes of a late surge failed to materialise. Liam Livingstone nicked behind and Brydon Carse was bowled swinging at the other end. England captain Jos Buttler: ""Disappointed to not win. We got off to a fantastic start, the two opening guys were really aggressive. Losing four wickets close together got us down. We saw how the wicket played, 40 runs would've been crucial. ""It's not how we want to play. We're trying to put the opposition under pressure and try to keep the momentum going for as long as possible."" India captain Rohit Sharma: ""We all knew we were coming off a long time not playing this format. It didn't start off well, with the openers putting on pressure, but the way we came back was superb. ""This is a long-ish format when you have time to come back in the game. When things start coming away from you, it doesn't mean it'll keep coming away."""

It comes after the US president imposed 10% tariffs on all imports from China, where just under 40% of the firm's production is based. On top of potential price increases, the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels says it could have to implement changes to its supply chain.  Consumer and business groups in the US have warned that the tariffs may disrupt supply chains and lead to higher prices. ""Guidance includes the anticipated impact of new US tariffs... announced on February 1st, and mitigating actions we plan to take, including leveraging the strength of our supply chain, and potential pricing,"" Mattel said in its quarterly report. The toy industry has been facing slower sales in 2024, as a higher cost of living meant shoppers had less cash to spend on toys.  Despite this, Mattel's shares jumped by 10% in extended trading in New York, after the company forecast better profits for next year than had been expected by Wall Street analysts. Over the weekend, the head of International at the US Chamber of Commerce, John Murphy, said Trump's tariff plan will only ""raise prices for American families and upend supply chains"". This week, Trump paused plans to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico but went ahead with an additional 10% levy on Chinese-made goods."

The decision to abandon the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) recruitment targets comes after the company carried out an annual review of its corporate policies. The technology giant is also reviewing some of its other DEI programmes. US President Donald Trump and his allies have regularly attacked DEI policies. Since his return to the White House just over two weeks ago, Trump has ordered government agencies to eliminate such initiatives. ""We're committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""We've updated our [annual investor report] language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic."" The story was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Between 2021 and 2024, Google's investor reports stated its commitment to make ""diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do"". That line is not in its latest report, which was published on Wednesday. In recent years, Google had been an outspoken supporter of DEI targets, particularly after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the protests that followed his death. At the time, Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, set a five-year goal to increase the number of its leaders who came from underrepresented groups by 30%. According to the company, the proportion of black people among its leadership almost doubled between 2020 and last year. It also said representation of women and Latino people had increased in those roles. Google is the latest major company to make a U-turn on its diversity policies. Meta, Amazon, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walmart and others have rolled back their DEI programmes. Apple has stood out by pushing back against this trend. Last month, the tech giant's board asked investors to vote against a proposal to end its diversity policies. The proposal by conservative group, the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), called on the iPhone maker to abolish its DEI policies, saying they expose firms to ""litigation, reputational and financial risks"". Last week, the retail chain Target was sued by a group of shareholders, led by the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida, who said the firm had defrauded them by allegedly concealing the risks associated with its DEI policies. The lawsuit referred to a 2023 backlash over LGBTQ+ merchandise at its stores, which caused both its sales and its stock price to drop. Target has also recently announced that it was ending its DEI targets. In the latest example of the Trump administration's disapproval of such policies, the US President last week speculated, without giving evidence, that DEI had led to an air crash in Washington DC. The remarks, which came less than 24 hours after the crash, were in line with the White House's efforts to undo such programmes.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w83x38zvwo","US Postal Service resumes deliveries from China",2025-02-05,"Michael Race & João da Silva","Business reporters, BBC News","The US Postal Service (USPS) has resumed accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong following a brief suspension after Donald Trump changed the rules on import taxes. USPS said it was working with US Customs and Border Protection to ensure ""the least disruption"" to package deliveries as the US president announced trade measures which included higher tariffs on Chinese goods. The US also ended a policy that allowed small packages worth $800 (£641) or less to be sent to America without paying taxes or fees. Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, have used the exemption to ship low-value packages to the US and have benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union (EU) to reach millions of customers. The explosion of parcels being shipped under the loophole has prompted increased scrutiny in recent years. While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen their sales soar.  It has prompted concerns that domestic retailers are being undercut and governments are missing out on potential tax income. Nick Stowe, chief executive of Monsoon Accessorize, told the BBC's Today programme he was in support of the changes in the US.  ""It has long been a complaint of UK retailers, European retailers as well as the US retailers that Shein are exploiting this loophole, not paying customs duty and they have built a business at an industrial scale,"" he said. America's change to stop low-value products being shipped tax-free under the so-called ""de minimis"" exemption came into force on Tuesday. The postal service initially halted parcels from China overnight but restarted them on Wednesday, stating: ""The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery."" Letters are not affected by any changes announced by Trump, who set out plans to impose a 10% tariff on all goods imported to the US from China. Shipping and courier giant DHL said that it was ""working with our customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders to navigate these changes"" to avoid disruptions to supply chains and ""limit adverse impact on US importers and consumers"". Meanwhile the EU - which has been exploring similar measures to the US - announced that Temu and Shein would be liable for the sale of unsafe and dangerous products on their platforms. In the EU, retailers benefit from paying no tax on parcels worth less than €150 (£124), a policy critics argue gives those firms an unfair advantage. According to the European Commission, 4.6 billion low-value items worth below €22 were imported into the EU last year, 91% of which came from China - double that of 2023. The EU announced that it would increase customs checks on goods shipped directly by e-commerce retailers. It also said it would coordinate a joint investigation by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network into Shein based on suspicions that the company infringes EU consumer protection rules. Shein said it would engage with the CPC agencies and the EU so consumers ""can shop online with peace of mind"". ""We want to see a competitive e-commerce sector that keeps consumers safe, offers convenient products, and is respectful of the environment,"" said EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen. In the US, close to half of all parcels entering the country under de minimis exemptions were sent from China, according to a 2023 report by US Congress. Officials have pointed out that the large flow of parcels entering the country through this exemption made it increasingly difficult to screen them for possible illegal goods. Changes to the tax exemption in the US under President Joe Biden were already in progress before Trump took office, but Trump has gone further to extend tariffs to all China goods being imported into the US, including fashion items and toys.  In response, China said it would hit back with its own levies and place PVH, the US company that owns designer brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, on its ""unreliable entity"" list for alleged ""discriminatory measures against Chinese enterprises"". Trump had been expected to speak to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in the coming days but on Tuesday the US president said he was in ""no rush"" to hold talks. Some retailers in the UK have called on the government to take action on low-value products being imported to the country free of tax. ""The rules weren't made for a company sending individual parcels [and] having a billion-pound turnover in the UK without paying any tax,"" Julian Dunkerton, boss of clothing chain Superdry, told the BBC in September. Shipments worth less than £135 that are sent directly to UK shoppers do not face import duties, but firms bringing in larger consignments do. Mr Stowe of Monsoon Accessorize, said he didn't think the parcels should be stopped but e-commerce companies should pay their ""fare share"".

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pwjgp59do","Jeremy Bowen: Trump's Gaza plan won't happen, but it will have consequences",2025-02-05,"Jeremy Bowen","International editor","Donald Trump's plan for the US to ""take over"" and ""own"" Gaza, resettling its population in the process, is not going to happen. It requires the co-operation of Arab states that have rejected it. They include Jordan and Egypt - countries that Trump wants to take in Gaza's Palestinians - and Saudi Arabia, which might be expected to foot the bill.  Western allies of the US and Israel are also against the idea. Some - perhaps many - Palestinians in Gaza might be tempted to get out if they had the chance.  But even if a million left, as many as 1.2m others would still be there. Presumably the United States - the new owners of Trump's ""Riviera of the Middle East"" - would have to use force to remove them.  After America's catastrophic intervention in Iraq in 2003, that would be deeply unpopular in the US. It would be the final end of any lingering hope that a two-state solution was possible. That is the aspiration that a conflict more than a century old could be ended with the establishment of an independent Palestine alongside Israel.  The Netanyahu government is adamantly against the idea, and over years of failed peace talks, ""two states for two peoples"" became an empty slogan.  But it has been a central plank of US foreign policy since the early 1990s. The Trump plan would also violate international law.  America's already threadbare assertions that it believes in a rules-based international order would dissolve. Russia's territorial ambitions in Ukraine and China's in Taiwan would be turbocharged. Why worry about all that if it is not about to happen - at least not in the way Trump announced in Washington, watched by a grinning and clearly delighted Benjamin Netanyahu? The answer is that Trump's remarks, however outlandish, will have consequences.  He is the president of the United States, the most powerful man in the world - no longer a reality TV host and political hopeful trying to grab headlines. Short-term, the disruption caused by his stunning announcement could weaken the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. One senior Arab source told me it could be its ""death knell"". The absence of a plan for Gaza's future governance is already a fault line in the agreement. Now Trump has provided one, and even if it does not come to pass, it presses very big buttons in the minds of Palestinians and Israelis. It will nourish the plans and dreams of ultra-nationalist Jewish extremists who believe all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river, and perhaps beyond, is a God-given Jewish possession.  Their leaders are part of Netanyahu's government and keep him in power - and they're delighted. They want the Gaza war to resume with the longer-term objective of removing the Palestinians and replacing them with Jews. The finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said Trump had provided the answer to Gaza's future after the 7 October attacks.  His statement said that ""whoever committed the most terrible massacre on our land will find himself losing his land forever. Now we will act to finally bury, with God's help, the dangerous idea of a Palestinian state.""   Centrist opposition leaders in Israel have been less effusive, perhaps fearing trouble ahead, but have offered a polite welcome to the plan. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups may feel the need to answer Trump with some kind of show of force against Israel.  For Palestinians, the conflict with Israel is driven by dispossession and the memory of what they call al-Nakba, ""the catastrophe"".  That was the exodus of Palestinians as Israel won its war for independence in 1948.  More than 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were forced from their homes by Israeli forces. All but a handful were never allowed back and Israel passed laws it still uses to confiscate their property. Now the fear will be that it is happening again.  Many Palestinians already believed Israel was using the war against Hamas to destroy Gaza and expel the population.   It is part of their accusation that Israel is committing genocide – and now they might believe Donald Trump is adding his weight to Israel's plans. Just because Trump says something, that does not make it true or certain.  His statements are often more like opening gambits in a real estate negotiation than expressions of the settled policy of the United States. Perhaps Trump is spreading some confusion while he works on another plan. He is said to crave the Nobel peace prize.  Middle East peacemakers, even when they do not ultimately succeed, have a strong track record of winning it. As the world was digesting his Gaza announcement, he posted on his Truth Social platform his desire for a ""verified nuclear peace agreement"" with Iran. The Iranian regime denies it wants nuclear weapons but there has been an open debate in Tehran about whether they are now so threatened that they need the ultimate deterrent. For many years Netanyahu has wanted the US, with Israeli help, to destroy Iran's nuclear sites. Doing a deal with Iran was never part of his plan.  During Trump's first term, Netanyahu waged a long and successful campaign to persuade him to pull the US out of the nuclear deal Barack Obama's administration signed with Iran. If Trump wanted to throw the Israeli hard-right something to keep them happy as he makes overtures to the Iranians, he has succeeded. But he has also created uncertainty and injected more instability into the world's most turbulent region."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy081nqx2zjo","Concern over Google ending ban on AI weapons",2025-02-05,"Lucy Hooker & Chris Vallance","Business & technology reporters","Google's parent company lifting a longstanding ban on artificial intelligence (AI) being used for developing weapons and surveillance tools is ""incredibly concerning"", a leading human rights group has said. Alphabet has rewritten its guidelines on how it will use AI, dropping a section which previously ruled out applications that were ""likely to cause harm"". Human Rights Watch has criticised the decision, telling the BBC that AI can ""complicate accountability"" for battlefield decisions that ""may have life or death consequences."" In a blog post Google defended the change, arguing that businesses and democratic governments needed to work together on AI that ""supports national security"". Experts say AI could be widely deployed on the battlefield - though there are fears about its use too, particularly with regard to autonomous weapons systems. ""For a global industry leader to abandon red lines it set for itself signals a concerning shift, at a time when we need responsible leadership in AI more than ever,"" said Anna Bacciarelli, senior AI researcher at Human Rights Watch.  The ""unilateral"" decision showed also showed ""why voluntary principles are not an adequate substitute for regulation and binding law"" she added. In its blog, Alphabet,  said democracies should lead in AI development, guided by what it called ""core values"" like freedom, equality and respect for human rights. ""And we believe that companies, governments and organisations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth and supports national security,"" it added The blog - written by senior vice president James Manyika and Sir Demis Hassabis, who leads the AI lab Google DeepMind - said the company's original AI principles published in 2018 needed to be updated as the technology had evolved.  Awareness of the military potential of AI has grown in recent years.  In January, MP's argued that the conflict in Ukraine had shown the technology ""offers serious military advantage on the battlefield"" As AI becomes more widespread and sophisticated it would ""change the way defence works, from the back office to the frontline,"" Emma Lewell-Buck MP, who chaired a recent commons report into the UK military's use of AI, wrote.  But as well as debate among AI experts and professionals over how the powerful new technology should be governed in broad terms, there is also controversy around the use of AI on the battlefield and in surveillance technologies. Concern is greatest over the potential for AI-powered weapons capable of taking lethal action autonomously, with campaigners arguing controls are urgently needed. The Doomsday Clock - which symbolises how near humanity is to destruction - cited that concern in its latest assessment of the dangers mankind faces. ""Systems that incorporate artificial intelligence in military targeting have been used in Ukraine and the Middle East, and several countries are moving to integrate artificial intelligence into their militaries"", it said. ""Such efforts raise questions about the extent to which machines will be allowed to make military decisions—even decisions that could kill on a vast scale"", it added. Originally, long before the current surge of interest in the ethics of AI, Google's founders, Sergei Brin and Larry Page, said their motto for the firm was ""don't be evil"". When the company was restructured under the name Alphabet Inc in 2015 the parent company switched to ""Do the right thing"". Since then Google staff have sometimes pushed back against the approach taken by their executives. In 2018, the firm did not renew a contract for AI work with the US Pentagon following resignations and a petition signed by thousands of employees. They feared ""Project Maven"" was the first step towards using artificial intelligence for lethal purposes.  The blog was published just ahead of Alphabet's end of year financial report, showing results that were weaker than market expectations, and knocking back its share price. That was despite a 10% rise in revenue from digital advertising, its biggest earner, boosted by US election spending. In its earnings report the company said it would spend $75bn ($60bn) on AI projects this year, 29% more than Wall Street analysts had expected. The company is investing in the infrastructure to run AI, AI research, and applications such as AI-powered search."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8975qp1n4qo","Argentina leader orders WHO exit in move mirroring Trump's",2025-02-05,"Vanessa Buschschlüter","BBC News","The Argentine government led by Javier Milei has announced that it plans to pull out of the World Health Organisation (WHO). A spokesman for President Milei said the decision to exit the WHO was triggered by ""deep differences regarding health management especially during the [Covid-19] pandemic"". The announcement comes just over two weeks after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing from the international health body. The two leaders have expressed admiration for each other, with Milei calling Trump's re-election the ""greatest political comeback in history"", while the US president described his Argentine counterpart as ""my favourite president"". The decision by President Milei to withdraw his country from the WHO follows the same arguments that underpinned the withdrawal of the United States. Both cited the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw a long lockdown imposed in Argentina, as well as concerns over Chinese influence over the global health body. The difference is the impact this is likely to have on the WHO itself.  The USA is by far the biggest individual contributor to the UN body, putting in around $950m (£760m) in 2024, nearly 15% of the total budget. The US withdrawal will pose some difficult financial questions.  Argentina on the other hand contributes roughly $8m a year. That is unlikely to make any significant material difference. The bigger question is whether other leaders who share President Trump's world view, as President Milei clearly does, decide to take similar action.  If more states pull out – and that is admittedly a big if - the credibility of the WHO as the one truly global health body could take a hit. Argentine media say they expect President Milei to sign an executive order in the coming days which will begin the process of Argentina pulling out from the WHO. Speaking at a news conference, presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni said that ""we Argentines are not going to allow an international body to interfere with our sovereignty, and even less with our health"". The spokesman argued that an exit from the WHO would provide Argentina with more flexibility to implement policies tailored to its own interests and to administer its funds as it saw fit.  President Milei, who describes himself as an ""anarcho-capitalist"", has been critical of the WHO for some time but the idea of leaving the body appears to have gained traction in the days after Donald Trump signed an executive order setting in motion the US's exit from the international body. The two heads of state appear to share mutual admiration for each other. Javier Milei was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his election victory on 5 November.   Speaking at a gala at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on the night of their meeting, Milei said that ""the winds of freedom [were] blowing much stronger since Trump's victory"".  Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether President Milei was planning to withdraw from other international bodies or treaties, the presidential spokesman refused to rule out anything.  ""The president is very determined when it comes to making Argentina freer, so any link that Argentina has with bodies that go against its freedoms, we're going to do our utmost to prevent them from interfering in the lives of Argentines."" Environmental activists in Argentina say they fear that Milei will follow in Trump's footsteps and also set the wheels in motion to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement - the international treaty which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5y1r189m0o","Ghana wants more for its cashews, but it's a tough nut to crack",2025-02-05,"Ed Butler","Business reporter, BBC News","The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused. I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p). That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up. The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer. ""It's incredible,"" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning. The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy. Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second. To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews. Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them. He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult. ""We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,"" he says. ""I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry."" He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews. ""It's amazing,"" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. ""Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne."" As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews. Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year. Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana. ""If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,"" she complains. ""As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies."" She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam. Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs. It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself. Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders. Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer. More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms. But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies. ""In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,"" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. ""You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class"". Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses. Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews. ""These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. ""They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it]."" He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation. But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive. ""There's a massive brain drain,"" he says. ""My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation."" He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West. Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate. ""I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast. ""There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx253xjnxrmo","USAID staff will be put on leave starting on Friday",2025-02-06,"Ana Faguy","BBC News","Thousands of employees at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) will be placed on leave from Friday night, the agency says. A USAID statement said the order would affect all ""direct-hire personnel"" except those on ""mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs"".  It's unclear exactly which jobs are affected. The statement, posted on the agency's website, said employees would be notified by Thursday afternoon. The Trump administration has said USAID is wasting money and needs to align with the president's policy priorities. Agency staff, backed by Democratic lawmakers, have protested over the cuts, saying they will put lives in danger and hamper national security. President Donald Trump's earlier decision to freeze foreign assistance has upended the global aid system, with effects already felt in multiple countries. The agency, which provides humanitarian aid to more than 100 countries, employs 10,000 people worldwide. Two-thirds of those people work overseas, according to the Congressional Research Service.  USAID, founded in 1961, has a budget of around $40bn (£32.25bn) per year, amounting to roughly 0.6% of federal spending, according to official figures. In a statement on its website on Tuesday, USAID said it would work with the US Department of State to arrange and pay for return travel for personnel posted outside the US within 30 days.  Those employees who are part of the exceptions will be told by 15:00 EDT (20:00 GMT) on Thursday, it said.  The statement concluded with the message: ""Thank you for your service."" Given that some USAID staff work in active conflict zones, it was not immediately clear how they would be withdrawn. The measures are part of a string of cuts that Trump has enacted since returning to office last month through co-ordination with Elon Musk's unofficial Department of Government Efficiency.  Among the countries affected by the aid freeze is Haiti. The United Nations said Tuesday that it had been notified by the US that it was freezing $13.3m in aid destined for the country. But on Wednesday the US state department issued a waiver exempting $40.7m of foreign assistance for Haiti's national police and the UN-backed international security support mission. Earlier this week, the White House put out a statement listing a number of projects that it called evidence of ""waste and abuse"", including a grant of $1.5m to an LGBTQ group in Serbia and $2.5m for electric vehicles in Vietnam. However critics have called the moves to close the agency an illegitimate power grab spearheaded by Musk, an unelected billionaire.  Earlier this week, Trump's top diplomat, Marco Rubio, became the acting head of USAID as part of its reported merger into the state department. Closing USAID altogether would require an act of Congress.  On Tuesday, many USAID staffers received an email notifying them they had been placed on paid administrative leave.  The email, obtained by BBC News, told employees they must remain ""available"" by telephone and email during business hours, but were not allowed to enter USAID buildings.   Musk, the CEO of Tesla and Space X, has suggested USAID should be shut down entirely, as it is ""beyond repair"".  Many have cautioned that closing the agency's doors would have devastating effects on vulnerable populations across the world.  USAID's activities range from providing prosthetic limbs to soldiers injured in Ukraine, to clearing landmines and containing the spread of Ebola in Africa.  An HIV patient in Nigeria told the BBC that she and others are worried that free anti-retroviral drugs, funded by USAID, would be cut off. ""I am really scared about what the future holds given all that is going on in America,"" she said. ""I got my last set of HIV drugs in November and I am supposed to go back in April... but I don't know what would happen by then.  ""These free drugs are really important for me and most of us (HIV patients) would be in trouble if it is affected,"" she said. Democrats in Washington DC have been particularly critical of changes to the agency, calling them ""illegal"" and ""unconstitutional"". ""[USAID is] a foreign policy tool with bipartisan origins that is critical in this dangerous global environment,"" New Jersey Democratic Senator Andy Kim, who previously worked at USAID, wrote on social media.  ""Gutting it means gutting our ability to compete and keep America safe."""

The league had carried out site visits to Melbourne and Sydney to explore the viability of playing in Australia. And the Melbourne Cricket Ground was selected to host the first game in the Asia-Pacific region during the 2026 season. The Los Angeles Rams will be the designated 'home' team for the first game of a multi-year commitment at the MCG, which has a capacity of about 100,000. ""We want to grow our game in all parts of the world,"" said NFL executive vice-president Peter O'Reilly. ""International games are one of the most impactful elements of our global strategy. ""We've seen that in recent years. The games really serve as a catalyst for growing the game at every level and year round."" The NFL has rapidly been expanding its global reach in recent years, playing its first game in South America this season, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. O'Reilly said the Melbourne game would ""likely"" be scheduled for week one of the 2026 season - like the Brazil game was - making it easier for teams to acclimatise. The Melbourne announcement was made in New Orleans during Super Bowl week, with further news expected on next season's international games.  So far five have been confirmed, with Madrid and Berlin set to host their first games in 2025, with three again being played in London. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell had previously said the league were ""shooting for"" eight international games in 2025. He ""expects"" to return to Brazil, while a first game in Ireland is ""a possibility"", and the NFL is in discussions over when it can return to Mexico following renovations to the Azteca Stadium."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7rx05xg2go","Why employees smuggle AI into work",2025-02-04,"Sean McManus","Technology Reporter","""It's easier to get forgiveness than permission,"" says John, a software engineer at a financial services technology company. ""Just get on with it. And if you get in trouble later, then clear it up."" He's one of the many people who are using their own AI tools at work, without the permission of their IT division (which is why we are not using John's full name).  According to a survey by Software AG, half of all knowledge workers use personal AI tools. The research defines knowledge workers as ""those who primarily work at a desk or computer"". For some it's because their IT team doesn't offer AI tools, while others said they wanted their own choice of tools. John's company provides GitHub Copilot for AI-supported software development, but he prefers Cursor. ""It's largely a glorified autocomplete, but it is very good,"" he says. ""It completes 15 lines at a time, and then you look over it and say, 'yes, that's what I would've typed'. It frees you up. You feel more fluent."" His unauthorised use isn't violating a policy, it's just easier than risking a lengthy approvals process, he says. ""I'm too lazy and well paid to chase up the expenses,"" he adds. John recommends that companies stay flexible in their choice of AI tools. ""I've been telling people at work not to renew team licences for a year at a time because in three months the whole landscape changes,"" he says. ""Everybody's going to want to do something different and will feel trapped by the sunk cost."" The recent release of DeepSeek, a freely available AI model from China, is only likely to expand the AI options. Peter (not his real name) is a product manager at a data storage company, which offers its people the Google Gemini AI chatbot. External AI tools are banned but Peter uses ChatGPT through search tool Kagi. He finds the biggest benefit of AI comes from challenging his thinking when he asks the chatbot to respond to his plans from different customer perspectives. ""The AI is not so much giving you answers, as giving you a sparring partner,"" he says. ""As a product manager, you have a lot of responsibility and don't have a lot of good outlets to discuss strategy openly. These tools allow that in an unfettered and unlimited capacity."" The version of ChatGPT he uses (4o) can analyse video. ""You can get summaries of competitors' videos and have a whole conversation [with the AI tool] about the points in the videos and how they overlap with your own products."" In a 10-minute ChatGPT conversation he can review material that would take two or three hours watching the videos. He estimates that his increased productivity is equivalent to the company getting a third of an additional person working for free. He's not sure why the company has banned external AI. ""I think it's a control thing,"" he says. ""Companies want to have a say in what tools their employees use. It's a new frontier of IT and they just want to be conservative."" The use of unauthorized AI applications is sometimes called 'shadow AI'. It's a more specific version of 'shadow IT', which is when someone uses software or services the IT department hasn't approved. Harmonic Security helps to identify shadow AI and to prevent corporate data being entered into AI tools inappropriately. It is tracking more than 10,000 AI apps and has seen more than 5,000 of them in use. These include custom versions of ChatGPT and business software that has added AI features, such as communications tool Slack. However popular it is, shadow AI comes with risks. Modern AI tools are built by digesting huge amounts of information, in a process called training.  Around 30% of the applications Harmonic Security has seen being used train using information entered by the user. That means the user's information becomes part of the AI tool and could be output to other users in the future. Companies may be concerned about their trade secrets being exposed by the AI tool's answers, but Alastair Paterson, CEO and co-founder of Harmonic Security, thinks that's unlikely. ""It's pretty hard to get the data straight out of these [AI tools],"" he says. However, firms will be concerned about their data being stored in AI services they have no control over, no awareness of, and which may be vulnerable to data breaches. It will be hard for companies to fight against the use of AI tools, as they can be extremely useful, particularly for younger workers. ""[AI] allows you to cram five years' experience into 30 seconds of prompt engineering,"" says Simon Haighton-Williams, CEO at The Adaptavist Group, a UK-based software services group.  ""It doesn't wholly replace [experience], but it's a good leg up in the same way that having a good encyclopaedia or a calculator lets you do things that you couldn't have done without those tools."" What would he say to companies that discover they have shadow AI use? ""Welcome to the club. I think probably everybody does. Be patient and understand what people are using and why, and figure out how you can embrace it and manage it rather than demand it's shut off. You don't want to be left behind as the organization that hasn't [adopted AI]."" Trimble provides software and hardware to manage data about the built environment. To help its employees use AI safely, the company created Trimble Assistant. It's an internal AI tool based on the same AI models that are used in ChatGPT. Employees can consult Trimble Assistant  for a wide range of applications, including product development, customer support and market research. For software developers, the company provides GitHub Copilot. Karoliina Torttila is director of AI at Trimble. ""I encourage everybody to go and explore all kinds of tools in their personal life, but recognise that their professional life is a different space and there are some safeguards and considerations there,"" she says. The company encourages employees to explore new AI models and applications online. ""This brings us to a skill we're all forced to develop: We have to be able to understand what is sensitive data,"" she says. ""There are places where you would not put your medical information and you have to be able to make those type of judgement calls [for work data, too]."" Employees' experience using AI at home and for personal projects can shape company policy as AI tools evolve, she believes. There needs to be a ""constant dialogue about what tools serve us the best"", she says."

This series and the Champions Trophy that follows mark the start of the journey towards the 2027 World Cup in South Africa in 50-over cricket. Root was a key part of England's 2019 World Cup win but has struggled for form in the format since, with his options limited because of clashes in the schedule between England's red and white-ball teams.

While arriving in Maryland from Florida, Trump told the BBC that tariffs on EU goods imported into the US could happen ""pretty soon"". ""They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products,"" he told journalists. The US President added he enjoyed good relations with British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, and that trade issues with the UK could be worked out.  When asked by the BBC if there was a timeline for announcing tariffs on the EU, Trump said: ""I wouldn't say there's a timeline, but it's going to be pretty soon."" For its part, the 27-member bloc has condemned Trump's decision to move ahead with tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, and warned that it will ""respond firmly"" if it also becomes a target. China said it could take ""corresponding counter measures"". Mexico and Canada have also vowed to take retaliatory measures, although Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said after meeting Trump on Monday that he had agreed to delay tariffs against her country for a month. On trade with Britain, Trump said: ""The UK is out of line. But I'm sure that one, I think that one, can be worked out."" He also discussed his relationship with the British Prime Minister who he said has been ""very nice"". ""We've had a couple of meetings. We've had numerous phone calls. We're getting along very well,"" he added. Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. The charges are seen as a tool to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.  Increasing the price of imported goods is aimed at encouraging consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead to help boost their own economy's growth. Most tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods and in general the importer pays it.  But given countries often respond to tariffs by matching measures of their own, businesses and consumers in both countries can be impacted.  Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on goods imported from the EU to the US to address his country's long-standing trade deficit with the bloc, which occurs when a country imports more than it exports. Some 20 EU member states exported more to the US than they imported in 2023, according to Eurostat. The country with the largest surplus was Germany, driven by car and machinery exports, followed by Italy and Ireland. Trump has repeatedly complained about the EU's car exports to the US, with fewer vehicles being shipped the other way. Last week, British business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told the BBC that the UK should be exempt from any tariffs, noting that the US does not have a goods trade deficit with the UK. Following Trump's comments, the main European stock markets all fell back. Shares in some of the biggest European carmakers also slumped following concerns over potential import duties to the US.  Volkswagen, BMW, Porsche, Volvo Cars, Stellantis, and truckmaker Daimler Truck all fell between around 5% and 6%. French car parts supplier Valeo slumped 8%. ""We believe around 8 billion euros ($8.18 billion) of VW's revenues are impacted by tariffs and around 16 billion euros of Stellantis revenues,"" analysts at investment bank Stifel wrote in a note. US shares also fell when trading started, although the main indexes pulled back some of the losses following the news that tariffs on Mexico were being delayed. The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders, because it will make it more difficult for companies to sell goods in the world's largest economy. But tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic policy. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70kn4676p4o","Share falls ease after Trump tariff turmoil",2025-02-03,"João da Silva, Nick Edser & Natalie Sherman","Business reporters, BBC News","US President Donald Trump's plans for tariffs sparked a global sell-off on financial markets on Monday, though a last-minute halt to levies on goods from Mexico brought some relief. After steep losses earlier in the day, news of the reprieve prompted shares to stage a partial recovery, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending the day down just 0.3%. The rebound followed a sharp slide after Trump issued orders over the weekend to put tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, and pledged that tariffs on the EU would ""definitely happen"". Investors are concerned that tariffs will hit the earnings of major companies and dent global growth but many are still hoping Trump is not serious. The S&P 500 closed 0.76% lower and the Nasdaq ended the day down by 1.2%. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held talks with Trump on the tariffs that were due to take effect on his country at midnight. After the markets closed, Mr Trudeau said the two men had agreed a deal that would pause tariffs for 30 days. Simon French, an economist at Panmure Liberum said investors had been ""pricing in"" an agreement with Canada, betting that the threats were ""simply a negotiating position from the Trump administration"". Earlier, the US dollar strengthened on the currency markets amid the uncertainty, rising to a record high against China's yuan, while the Canadian dollar plunged to its lowest level since 2003. Concerns about the tariffs had also hit shares in Asia and Europe.  The German stock market fell 1.4%, with shares in carmakers among the worst hit and France's CAC 40 index dropped 1.2%. In London, the FTSE 100 ended the day down about 1%. ""Investors are rattled at the prospects of a full-blown trade war breaking out,"" said  Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. Over the weekend, Trump ordered tariffs of 25% on exports from Canada and Mexico to the US, which were due to come into effect at midnight on Tuesday.  Chinese-made are still set to face a 10% levy, in addition to existing tariffs.  The announcements, which Trump tied to concerns about the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US, targeted the United States' three largest trading partners and threaten major disruption in some of the world's biggest economies.  Canada and Mexico said they would hit back with retaliatory tariffs while China promised ""corresponding countermeasures"" and vowed to challenge Trump's move at the World Trade Organization. But in a sign of how swiftly the circumstances might change, Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Monday that she had agreed to send 10,000 troops to the border and the tariffs would be on hold for one month, as the two sides continue to negotiate.  Many are still bracing for wider tensions, after Trump said on Sunday that he would ""definitely"" impose tariffs on the EU, although he said while the UK was ""out of line"", a deal could be worked out. On the Dow, which tracks 30 high-profile companies meant to be representative of the economy, Nike and Apple, which both rely on China for manufacturing, were among the hardest hit, with Apple down more than 3%. Elsewhere, carmakers such as Tesla and General Motors also saw share prices drop.  In Japan, Toyota shares fell 5% and Honda sank 7.2%, while in Europe shares in VW and Stellantis – whose brands include Chrysler, Citroen, Fiat, Jeep and Peugeot – were down roughly 4%. Shares in drinks maker Diageo - which exports tequila from Mexico to the US - ended the day down 1.9%, trimming earlier losses. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said there was a ""sea of red flashing on the markets"". Tariffs could lead to ""higher inflation and put a stop to further interest rate cuts for the time being – exactly the opposite of what equity investors want to happen"", he added. ""Higher prices could hurt demand, and there might be a trickle-down effect that knocks business and consumer confidence and feeds into weaker economic activity."" The prospect of interest rates staying higher for longer helped to strengthen the dollar. As well as the dollar rising against China's yuan and the Canadian dollar, the euro fell to more than a two-year low against the US currency. Oil prices also rose following news of the tariffs, as traders tried to analyse how tariffs on Canada and Mexico - the two biggest sources of oil imports to the US - would affect the market.  Chief investment strategist at investment bank Saxo, Charu Chanana, warned that while tariffs could be beneficial for the US economy in the short term, in the long run they pose significant risks. ""Repeated use of tariffs would incentivise other countries to reduce reliance on the US, weakening the dollar's global role,"" she added. "

The leaders spoke on Monday, their first conversation since Trump's inauguration last week. They discussed immigration, security issues and trade in what the White House described as a ""productive call"". Trump told reporters after the call that Modi was likely to visit the United States ""sometime in February"". Since taking office on 20 January, Trump has announced a number of immigration-related executive orders, paving the way for a widespread effort to crack down on undocumented migrants in the US. According to the Pew Research Center, there are an estimated 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US as of 2024. Last week, India's foreign ministry said Delhi would take in Indians overstaying ""anywhere in the world"" as long as their documents were shared and nationality was verified. In their phone call on Monday, the ministry said, Trump and Modi discussed the bilateral relationship, ""including in the areas of technology, trade, investment, energy and defence"". The two leaders also discussed security in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East and Europe.  According to a White House statement, Trump emphasised the importance of India increasing its procurement of US-made security equipment and moving towards a ""fair"" bilateral trading relationship. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Modi called Trump a ""dear friend"" and said they were ""committed to a mutually beneficial and trusted partnership"". The White House said both leaders emphasised their commitment to advancing their countries' strategic partnership and the Indo-Pacific Quad partnership, which also includes Japan and Australia. India will be hosting Quad leaders for the first time later this year. Modi and Trump shared cordial relations during the US president's first term between 2017 and 2021. But India faced a bitter tariff war with the Trump administration that affected businesses on both sides. In November, following Trump's election victory, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said the country was not nervous about working with the US president. Trump had called Modi a ""great leader"" last year but also accused India of charging excessive tariffs. Analysts say it will be interesting to watch if the bonhomie between the two will help overcome concerns about trade and immigration."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7p3vpepxo","Sri Lanka eases vehicle import ban, but can people afford a new car?",2025-01-31,"Anbarasan Ethirajan","South Asia Regional Editor","Sri Lanka is set to relax a ban on some vehicle imports in a sign the country is returning to normal after a severe economic crisis that toppled a president. From 1 February, imports of buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed to resume, while restrictions on other vehicles are expected to be gradually lifted. Many Sri Lankans are waiting for authorities to also drop an import ban on private cars, sport utility vehicles and three-wheeled trishaws - which are commonly used as taxis.  But with prices of vehicles forced up by a scarcity of new ones to buy,  a weak currency and high taxes, some are asking who will be able to afford a new car. In 2022, Sri Lanka faced a severe foreign currency shortage, which meant it was unable to meet its obligations to creditors for the first time in its history. The island nation of 22 million people was thrown into turmoil as it faced crippling shortages of fuel, food and medicines. Massive anti-government protests toppled then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa just months later. Colombo negotiated a $2.9bn (£2.3bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund, while Rajapaksa's successor introduced austerity measures including hiking taxes and ending energy subsidies. The country's finances have since improved and the economy is gradually returning from the brink. The announcement to lift the import ban on vehicles has triggered a buzz among Sri Lankans who have been waiting for years to buy a new car or a van. Murtaza Jafeerjee, chair of Advocata, an economic think tank based in Colombo, told the BBC he thought the move was long overdue. ""The vehicle imports will not only increase the government's revenue but will also trigger other economic activities like car financing, dealer revenue, car servicing and other related activities, creating jobs,"" he said. But Nalinda Jayatissa, the country's information minister told a media briefing on Tuesday that the country was ""moving very cautiously because we don't want a surge of imports that will deplete our foreign reserves"". The country, which doesn't have any major factories producing cars and trucks, imports almost all its vehicles, many of them from countries like Japan and India. Now there's a also lot of interest in Chinese cars, particularly electric vehicles. Prices of used cars in Sri Lanka have soared, with some models now costing two or three times as much as they did before the ban. The restrictions have been particularly difficult for people like Gayan Indika, who provides vehicles for weddings and is a part-time cab driver. ""I want to buy a new car so that I can do my work and resume my private cab rental. Without a car, without mobility, I am losing a lot of my revenue,"" he said. In a country with poor public transport, a car can be vital, Sasikumar, a software professional from the central city of Kandy explained.  ""As we don't have a good public transport system, a car is essential to travel to other parts of the country. Either the government should lift the ban on cars or improve the public transport.""  Sri Lanka imported about $1.4bn worth of vehicles in the year before the ban was imposed. This year the central bank says it's planning to allocate up to a billion dollars for vehicle imports, but said the money will be released gradually. Arosha Rodrigo, from the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka, and his family have been running a car dealership for more than four decades.  The firm was importing about 100 vehicles a month before the ban. Since the restrictions came into force they have not been able to import a single vehicle. He points out that even if the ban is relaxed further, to allow passenger cars and other vehicles to be imported, many people won't be able to afford them because of increased taxes and Sri Lanka's weak currency. The government has sharply raised excise duties on imported vehicles, both new and second hand, to 200% and 300% depending on engine size. On top of excise duty, there is also 18% Value Added Tax (VAT) for any vehicle brought from abroad. The price of imported vehicles will also be impacted by the weakness of the Sri Lankan rupee against major world currencies like the US dollar. Those soaring costs are putting off people like school teacher R Yasodha. ""We have been waiting to purchase a vehicle for a long time. But if we calculate the tax and the price, the cost of an average sized car has doubled from 2.5 million rupees ($8,450; £6,800) to five million rupees,"" she told the BBC.  ""It would cost a fortune for us."""

After moving to the UK from China in 2020, Yu Wang found herself studying for her Master's degree alone from her studio flat in Sheffield. With no in-person teaching and an empty social calendar, the now-30-year-old ended up seeking comfort in a childhood hobby. ""Because I'm the only person in my family who could travel abroad to study, I wanted to capture lots of beautiful moments and send the pictures to my parents,"" she said. ""When I first arrived in Sheffield, I shot everything – squirrels, flowers, buildings – I wanted to share it all."" But with the weight of being alone in a new country, and never being able to meet her lecturers or classmates at the University of Sheffield, Yu felt isolated. ""The only thing I could do was grab my camera and take a bus, maybe to the Peak District, far away from people,"" she said. ""I took my camera and lens and focused on people. I can feel [that] they feel very lonely."" One photo in her collection shows the back of a young man, alone on a park bench, with leafless winter branches framing him in the image. Another shows an elderly gentleman with a walking stick ambling down a country path on a similarly overcast day, with a white dog. ""Lots of people tell me the pictures make them feel sad, I was like, 'oh I'm so sorry!' – I [didn't] mean that. ""I just want people to remember that difficult time, and in the future, they will cherish their time spent with family and with friends."" Yu planned to go back to her family and become a teacher in 2021 with her Master's degree in cultural heritage management, but pandemic restrictions diverted her plans once again. When five of her flights home to Dongyang were cancelled, she successfully applied to have her tenancy and student visa extended, and decided to stay in the UK and look for work. ""I was trying to find something to do,"" Yu said.  ""My mum said, 'if you can't find a job, just try to use your camera… maybe you can have some customers who want graduation photos or portraits done'."" Since she last saw her parents five years ago, Yu has done exactly that. She now has ""a lot of customers"", and has been the official photographer for the World Snooker Tournament and Lunar Chinese New Year in Sheffield. ""I think without her suggestion, maybe I wouldn't have done it - I don't know,"" Yu said. ""It is about timing. And it was perfect timing when I came to Sheffield."" Yu said she is ""very excited"" to get some ""proper"" training which, surprisingly, she has never had before. ""It's always good to learn something new - you get new skills and knowledge, but also you get new friends,"" she said. ""I feel a little bit nervous - I don't know if I can do it very well. Maybe they will say you're not a good photographer."" The demand for her work makes this seem unlikely, however, with a whole host of exhibitions of her work scheduled for 2025. One of two exhibitions in Sheffield, on 10 February at the Octagon, focuses on the Lunar Chinese New Year – bringing an important cultural holiday for Yu to the city she has made her home. ""Photos become a bridge to connect people from different cultural backgrounds. I want to use mine to create memories for communities,"" she said. She will spend spring and summer in China, having some long-overdue time with her family and exhibiting the portraits, views and moments she captured in the UK. One of the exhibitions, showing throughout March, will be called ""the view in Sheffield"". She said: ""I want to use my photos to tell stories. That single frame has lots of depth and feelings and emotions. ""Even though people speak different languages, using our art like photography or performance lets people connect."" From her first photos of squirrels and trees sent her parents in lockdown to the graduations, cultural and sporting events she has covered since, Yu's portfolio is now rich and varied. She has built it up to the point that freelancing – which was challenging at first – is ""going easy"", she said, something she still cannot believe. ""Being a photographer was my dream when I was a child. ""All I wanted was to show my parents, 'this is Sheffield, this is the city where I need to spend lots of time'.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8k5gezykyo","How an AI-written book shows why the tech 'terrifies' creatives",2025-01-31,"Zoe Kleinman","Technology editor•@zsk","For Christmas I received an interesting gift from a friend - my very own ""best-selling"" book. ""Tech-Splaining for Dummies"" (great title) bears my name and my photo on its cover, and it has glowing reviews. Yet it was entirely written by AI, with a few simple prompts about me supplied by my friend Janet. It's an interesting read, and very funny in parts. But it also meanders quite a lot, and is somewhere between a self-help book and a stream of anecdotes. It mimics my chatty style of writing, but it's also a bit repetitive, and very verbose. It may have gone beyond Janet's prompts in collating data about me. Several sentences begin ""as a leading technology journalist…"" – cringe – which could have been scraped from an online bio. There's also a mysterious, repeated hallucination in the form of my cat (I have no pets). And there's a metaphor on almost every page – some more random than others. There are dozens of companies online offering AI-book writing services. My book was from BookByAnyone. When I contacted the chief executive Adir Mashiach, based in Israel, he told me he had sold around 150,000 personalised books, mainly in the US, since pivoting from compiling AI-generated travel guides in June 2024. A paperback copy of your own 240-page long best-seller costs £26. The firm uses its own AI tools to generate them, based on an open source large language model. I'm not asking you to buy my book. Actually you can't – only Janet, who created it, can order any further copies. There is currently no barrier to anyone creating one in anybody's name, including celebrities – although Mr Mashiach says there are guardrails around abusive content. Each book contains a printed disclaimer stating that it is fictional, created by AI, and designed ""solely to bring humour and joy"". Legally, the copyright belongs to the firm, but Mr Mashiach stresses that the product is intended as a ""personalised gag gift"", and the books do not get sold further. He hopes to broaden his range, generating different genres such as sci-fi, and perhaps offering an autobiography service. It's designed to be a light-hearted form of consumer AI – selling AI-generated goods to human customers. It's also a bit terrifying if, like me, you write for a living. Not least because it probably took less than a minute to generate, and it does, certainly in some parts, sound just like me. Musicians, authors, artists and actors worldwide have expressed alarm about their work being used to train generative AI tools that then churn out similar content based upon it. ""We should be clear, when we are talking about data here, we actually mean human creators' life works,"" says Ed Newton Rex, founder of Fairly Trained, which campaigns for AI firms to respect creators' rights. ""This is books, this is articles, this is photos. It's works of art. It's records… The whole point of AI training is to learn how to do something and then do more like that."" In 2023 a song featuring AI-generated voices of Canadian singers Drake and The Weeknd went viral on social media before being pulled from streaming platforms because it was not their work and they had not consented to it. It didn't stop the track's creator trying to nominate it for a Grammy award. And even though the artists were fake, it was still wildly popular. ""I do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned, but I do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people's work without permission should be banned,"" Mr Newton Rex adds. ""AI can be very powerful but let's build it ethically and fairly."" In the UK some organisations – including the BBC – have chosen to block AI developers from trawling their online content for training purposes. Others have decided to collaborate – the Financial Times has partnered with ChatGPT creator OpenAI for example. The UK government is considering an overhaul of the law that would allow AI developers to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders opt out. Ed Newton Rex describes this as ""insanity"". He points out that AI can make advances in areas like defence, healthcare and logistics without trawling the work of authors, journalists and artists. ""All of these things work without going and changing copyright law and ruining the livelihoods of the country's creatives,"" he argues. Baroness Kidron, a crossbench peer in the House of Lords, is also strongly against removing copyright law for AI. ""Creative industries are wealth creators, 2.4 million jobs and a whole lot of joy,"" says the Baroness, who is also an advisor to the Institute for Ethics in AI at Oxford University. ""The government is undermining one of its best performing industries on the vague promise of growth."" A government spokesperson said: ""No move will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives: increased control for right holders to help them license their content, access to high-quality material to train leading AI models in the UK, and more transparency for right holders from AI developers."" Under the UK government's new AI plan, a national data library containing public data from a wide range of sources will also be made available to AI researchers. In the US the future of federal rules to control AI is now up in the air following President Trump's return to the presidency. In 2023 Biden signed an executive order that aimed to boost the safety of AI with, among other things, firms in the sector required to share details of the workings of their systems with the US government before they are released.  But this has now been repealed by Trump. It remains to be seen what Trump will do instead, but he is said to want the AI sector to face less regulation. This comes as a number of lawsuits against AI firms, and particularly against OpenAI, continue in the US. They have been taken out by everyone from the New York Times to authors, music labels, and even a comedian. They claim that the AI firms broke the law when they took their content from the internet without their consent, and used it to train their systems. The AI companies argue that their actions fall under ""fair use"" and are therefore exempt. There are a number of factors which can constitute fair use – it's not a straight-forward definition. But the AI sector is under increasing scrutiny over how it gathers training data and whether it should be paying for it. If this wasn't all enough to ponder, Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has shaken the sector over the past week. It became the most downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store. DeepSeek claims that it developed its technology for a fraction of the price of the likes of OpenAI. Its success has raised security concerns in the US, and threatens American's current dominance of the sector. As for me and a career as an author, I think that at the moment, if I really want a ""bestseller"" I'll still have to write it myself. If anything, Tech-Splaining for Dummies highlights the current weakness in generative AI tools for bigger projects. It is full of inaccuracies and hallucinations, and it can be quite difficult to read in parts because it's so long-winded. But given how quickly the tech is evolving, I'm not sure how long I can remain confident that my considerably slower human writing and editing skills, are better.

The B6918 and Callerton Lane near Newcastle International Airport were designated a red route in October, marked by double red lines. Sixteen people received warning letters during a two-week period from 21 October, with 52 penalty charge notices issued between 4 November and 27 January. It follows concerns motorists were using the area to avoid paying for a parking space at the airport while they dropped people off or picked them up. The Labour-led authority said the ""tougher measures"" were needed because the previous double yellow lines were often ignored. A Newcastle City Council spokesperson said: ""Since the scheme was introduced we have seen a significant improvement in parking issues in the local area, with the majority of drivers adhering to the restrictions."" Ahead of the red route's introduction, Pamela Holmes, assistant director for transport, said people living in the area had raised issues with vehicles stopping outside their homes ""often during the night and early hours"". Penalty charges are £70, or £35 if paid within 21 days, while the airport car park closest to the terminal costs £5 for 10 minutes, £8 for 30 minutes and £12 for an hour. However, an alternative facility further away offers 15 minutes without charge and there is a free waiting area for cars and taxis at Callerton Parkway. The council said it ""would strongly encourage people to use them, rather than risk a fine"". When the measures were first announced last August, the airport said it ""fully supported"" them.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvm17dwv1vo","Is Rachel Reeves abandoning the North?",2025-01-31,"Richard Moss","Political editor, North East & Cumbria•@bbcrichardmoss","As I listened to coverage of Chancellor Rachel Reeves announcing her backing for airport expansion and a UK Silicon Valley in the south-east of England, I was driving through crumbling northern infrastructure. First up, a coned-off flyover in Gateshead. This crucial section of the A167 was shut last year after its 1960s concrete proved so corroded it was in danger of imminent collapse. It was so bad that, for a time, Tyne and Wear Metro trains had to stop running underneath it, causing chaos for commuters and Christmas shoppers. Talks have opened with the government for help toward its demolition and replacement, but so far no money has been forthcoming. Once past that obstacle, you come to the iconic Tyne Bridge. Except, it looks less than lovely at the moment. It is shrouded in scaffolding while the neglected, rusting hulk is gradually restored.  Work will take years and has slowed traffic to a crawl. Before last July's election, money had been promised (though not actually paid out) by the Conservatives to fund its revitalisation, but now the people of the North East are waiting to see whether that pledge will be honoured by Labour.  If you add in Labour's decision to abandon plans to upgrade part of the A1 in Northumberland to dual carriageway, you can forgive the region for casting a rather envious glance at Rachel Reeves' push for growth in the south. Never mind a third runway, we wouldn't mind having a functioning flyover. So not, perhaps, what voters who backed Reeves' party in 26 of the region's 27 constituencies last year might have hoped for.  Not that there is much hankering for the ""halcyon"" days of Tory levelling up.  A failure to convince voters that idea was much more than sloganeering was a significant part of why the Conservatives lost big. Northerners are used to disappointment, but have we really been abandoned again in favour of the apparently easier growth hits available in the South? Odd as it seems, Heathrow expansion at least could offer benefits.  Newcastle has a daily link to the airport and, so it's argued, can enjoy some collateral boost.  And when it was last proposed, the new runway was set to offer a service between Teesside Airport and London.  The chancellor has also talked about the role Teesside can play in manufacturing the new sustainable aviation fuels that will be needed to make the case for airport expansion. When I have interviewed Reeves on her recent visits to the region, it is the passing of powers and funding to Conservative Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen and Labour's North East Mayor Kim McGuinness that she has sold as key to growth here. But will all that really transform the fortunes of England's poorest region and close the longstanding performance gap with the South?  That seems like a leap.  What Rachel Reeves' speech demonstrated is that big infrastructure improvement requires government action. The North still has no recent investment to compare to the billions put into London's Elizabeth Line, and expecting southern success to trickle up the country has not worked for more than a century now. This was, though, one speech on one day, for a Chancellor that still has a few years to prove northern voters were right to back her party. But Labour know they can no longer take the people of the North East for granted. The Conservative's temporary success of 2019 here proved that, while the rise of Reform UK poses a new threat. The ""Red Wall"" of Labour MPs might have been rebuilt last July, but the party will need to keep a firm eye on its shallow foundations to avoid the brickwork crumbling as badly as that Gateshead flyover.

But Trump said on Friday that Canadian oil would be hit with lower tariffs of 10%, which could take effect later, on 18 February.  The president also said he planned to impose tariffs on the European Union in the future, saying the bloc had not treated the US well.  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Canada and Mexico duties were in response to ""the illegal fentanyl that they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans"". Trump has also repeatedly said the move was to address the large amounts of undocumented migrants that have come across US borders as well as trade deficits with its neighbours. Ms Leavitt told a news briefing at the White House on Friday: ""These are promises made and promises kept by the President."" During the election campaign, Trump threatened to hit Chinese-made products with tariffs of up to 60%, but held off on any immediate action on his first day back in the White House, instead ordering his administration to study the issue. US goods imports from China have flattened since 2018, a statistic that economists have attributed in part to a series of escalating tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term. Earlier this month, a top Chinese official warned against protectionism as Trump's return to the presidency renews the threat of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies - but did not mention the US by name. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Ding Xuexiang, Vice Premier of China, said his country was looking for a ""win-win"" solution to trade tensions and wanted to expand its imports. China, Canada and Mexico are the top US trading partners, accounting for 40% of the goods imported into the US last year, and fears are rising that the new steep levies could kick off a major trade war as well as push up prices in the US. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday: ""It's not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act."" Canada and Mexico have already said that they would respond to US tariffs with measures of their own, while also seeking to assure Washington that they were taking action to address concerns about their US borders. The BBC has reached out to the Chinese embassy in the US for comment. If US imports of oil from Canada and Mexico are hit with levies it risks undermining Trump's promise to bring down the cost of living. Tariffs are an import tax on goods that are produced abroad. In theory, taxing items coming into a country means people are less likely to buy them as they become more expensive. The intention is that they buy cheaper local products instead - boosting a country's economy. But the cost of tariffs on imported energy could be passed on to businesses and consumers, which may increase the prices of everything from petrol to groceries. Around 40% of the crude that runs through US oil refineries is imported, and the vast majority of it comes from Canada. On Friday, Trump agreed tariff costs are sometimes passed along to consumers and that his plans may cause disruption in the short-term. Mark Carney, the former head of Canada's and England's central banks, told BBC Newsnight on Friday that the tariffs will hit economic growth and drive up inflation.  ""They're going to damage the US's reputation around the world,"" said Carney, who is also in the running to replace Prime Minister Trudeau as leader of Canada's Liberal Party. "

Sam Morecroft, UCU branch chair, said: ""It is clear these redundancies have nothing to do with falling student numbers and everything to do with an attempt to force an untested standardised operating model on our college.""

Sources at Barcelona said the total deal was worth up to £800,000, including add-ons. Chelsea sources would not confirm the figures involved but said the basic fee was lower than £800,000. Barcelona had been unwilling to sell but it is believed Chelsea's bid was accepted late on Wednesday, and Walsh was due in London for a medical on Thursday. The 27-year-old, who left Manchester City to join Barcelona for a then world record fee of £400,000 in 2022, was keen to return to England to be close to family. The fee is believed to be under the world record of around £900,000 Chelsea paid for USA defender Naomi Girma earlier this month. Chelsea's interest in Walsh has been long-standing and the club have been looking to bolster their midfield options since the summer. Walsh told Barcelona in September that she did not wish to extend her contract, with it due to expire in six months' time. Arsenal had maintained their interest but Walsh's preference has always appeared to lean towards Chelsea. It is another huge signing for Chelsea with Walsh becoming the second most expensive female footballer in the world.  During her time at Barcelona, Walsh has won back-to-back league titles and the Champions League. It has been a huge month for Chelsea as they have broken multiple records to sign some of the world's best players. They brought in Girma, widely regarded as the best centre-back in the world, and now Walsh for the two biggest transfer fees in the women's game. Chelsea have made no secret that their intention is to win the Women's Champions League and they have backed manager Sonia Bompastor to do that. Despite featuring for Barcelona in the group stages of the competition, Walsh is eligible to register for Chelsea from the start of the quarter-finals. They remain unbeaten in the WSL with a seven-point lead at the top of the table and are in the fifth round of the Women's FA Cup and the semi-finals of the Women's League Cup as they chase a quadruple. By signing Walsh they have found cover for injured midfielder Sophie Ingle, who has missed the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, as well as taken a key player away from European rivals Barcelona. Walsh was always keen to return home having felt like she had achieved all she could in Barcelona and it means she will be close to family in the build-up to Euro 2025."

A player who is capable of playing in central midfield or out wide, Widell has made 51 appearances for AaB, scoring 11 goals and registering nine assists. ""He is the real deal, he is professional,"" Williams added.  ""He will bring something different. He can beat people, see passes and make connections at the top of the pitch. We are really excited.""  Widell's arrival is not related to Matt Grimes' move to Coventry City. Swansea are also working on other potential signings as they look to replace their departing captain and strengthen their attacking options for the rest of this season, with Williams' squad in need of immediate reinforcements having taken only one point from their past five league games."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx9e0y17wwo","Leaving X can be a tricky decision for brands",2025-01-30,"Dan Rosney","BBC Business Reporter","On March 21, 2006 the first ever tweet was posted by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey: ""Just setting up my twttr"". It was a simple introduction to a brand new platform. Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers. ""If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,"" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News. On June 4, 2010 Elon Musk, the owner of Space X, logged on for the first time: ""Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me."" Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (£38.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around ""free speech"", and rename it X. He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce. Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed ""the great X-odus"". One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.  For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue. More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy. In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.  ""There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,"" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News. However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35. The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.  At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform. Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site. ""It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,"" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues. ""It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'. ""Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports  - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it."" Trump's election victory has prompted other organisations to leave X, with others considering their positions as Mr Musk's influence in the White House grows. Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers. But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: ""You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here."" ""We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,"" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC. ""We have seen assaults on X, antisemitism, conspiracy theories,"" he says. The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him. ""We don't think racism is freedom of speech,"" says Mr Gensing. One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram. There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform. When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its ""purpose is to serve the public conversation"". Mr Musk ""has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter"", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School. But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.  ""When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,"" he tells BBC News. ""Users protesting by leaving should weigh the broader social implications of staying versus exiting."" For some organisations who need to get their message out quickly, X still has value that other competitors simply can't offer. ""For us there is still that value [on being on X],"" says Andrew Cassidy, senior director of digital strategy and engagement at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). ""We try to match where our riders are. When people are tweeting at the MBTA someone can provide a definitive answer in the moment. Our broadcasting system is exclusively tied into our X account, but we still field customer service questions across other platforms."" ""Our focus is providing customer service to the largest number of riders that we possibly can,"" Mr Cassidy says. ""With the current landscape being what it is, X still feeds that need."" It's ""unthinkable"", Mr Gensing explains, not to have a presence on social media in 2025. ""We have to view all the platforms critically, it's not only X. The companies behind them set up the rules of the game and they can change them."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vm1m8wpr9o","OpenAI says Chinese rivals using its work for their AI apps",2025-01-29,"João da Silva & Graham Fraser","Business & technology reporters","The maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI, has complained that rivals, including those in China, are using its work to make rapid advances in developing their own artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The status of OpenAI - and other US firms - as the world leaders in AI has been dramatically undermined this week by the sudden emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese app that can emulate the performance of ChatGPT, apparently at a fraction of the cost. Bloomberg has reported that Microsoft is investigating whether data belonging to OpenAI - which it is a major investor in - has been used in an unauthorised way. The BBC has contacted Microsoft and DeepSeek for comment. OpenAI's concerns have been echoed by the recently appointed White House ""AI and crypto czar"", David Sacks. Speaking on Fox News, he suggested that DeepSeek may have used the models developed by OpenAI to get better, a process called knowledge distillation. ""There's substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI's models,"" Mr Sacks said.  ""I think one of the things you're going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation... That would definitely slow down some of these copycat models."" The US has already taken steps to guard its AI advances, with rules that seek to cut China off from advanced chips and steer investments to the US in the name of national security.  At his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Trump's nominee for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, also shared concerns about theft and raised the prospect of further US action to protect US AI companies. ""What this showed is that our export controls, not backed by tariffs, are like a whack-a-mole model,"" Lutnick says. In a statement, OpenAI said Chinese and other companies were ""constantly trying to distil the models of leading US AI companies"". ""As we go forward... it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models,"" it added. Naomi Haefner, assistant professor of technology management at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, said the question of distillation could throw the notion that DeepSeek created its product for a fraction of the cost into doubt.  ""It is unclear whether DeepSeek really trained its models from scratch,"" she said. ""OpenAI have stated that they believe DeepSeek may have misappropriated large amounts of data from them.  ""If this is the case, then the claims about training the model very cheaply are deceptive. Until someone replicates the training approach we won't know for sure whether such cost-efficient training is really possible."" Crystal van Oosterom, AI Venture Partner at OpenOcean, agreed that ""DeepSeek has clearly built upon publicly available research from major American and European institutions and companies"". However, it is not clear how problematic the idea of ""building on"" the work of others is. This is especially true in AI, where the accusation of disrespecting intellectual property rights has been frequently levelled at major US AI firms.  US officials are also considering the national security implications of DeepSeek's emergence, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. ""I spoke with [the National Security Council] this morning, they are looking into what [the national security implications] may be,"" said Ms Leavitt, who also restated US President Donald Trump's remarks a day earlier that DeepSeek should be a wake-up call for the US tech industry. The announcement comes after the US navy reportedly banned its members from using DeepSeek's apps due to ""potential security and ethical concerns"". According to CNBC, the US navy has sent an email to its staff warning them not to use the DeepSeek app due to ""potential security and ethical concerns associated with the model's origin and usage"". The Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News. Data safety experts have warned users to be careful with the tool, given it collects large amounts of personal data and stores it in servers in China. Meanwhile, DeepSeek says it has been the target of cyber attacks. On Monday it said it would temporarily limit registrations because of  ""large-scale malicious attacks"" on its software. A banner showing on the company's website says registration may be busy as a result of the attacks.

As Leeds West MP, Reeves had opposed proposals for a new terminal at the Yorkshire site over environmental and noise concerns.  On Wednesday, Reeves announced the government's backing of a third runway at London Heathrow and the re-opening of the Doncaster Sheffield airport, citing the progress of ""sustainable aviation"" since the pandemic. In 2022, LBA's £150m scheme to develop a new terminal was abandoned over planning delays, in favour of an earlier proposal to regenerate the current terminal. Speaking in Yorkshire following the government decision to back a third runway at Heathrow, the chancellor said ""sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand-in-hand"".  She defended her previous position of opposing the Leeds Bradford expansion, insisting ""a lot has changed since 2020 when those plans last came forward - no one was flying because it was during the pandemic, but also the way we fly has changed"".  She added: ""Engines have become more efficient, and sustainable aviation fuel means we can reduce the carbon emissions from flying. ""Sustainable aviation fuel reduces carbon emissions by 70% and that mandate came in at the beginning of this year,"" she said, on Thursday. The Leeds West and Pudsey MP also highlighted the benefits the Heathrow expansion would have on the rest of the UK ""because the availability of slots at Heathrow is good for regional airports wanting to connect with the rest of the world"".  Leeds Bradford Airport first put forward plans for a new terminal five years ago, as part of its bid to increase passenger numbers at the airport to seven million by 2030. A planning application was approved by the council in February 2021, despite objections by campaigners and local MPs - including Reeves, then the member for Leeds West. ""It is clear that an increase in both flights and passenger numbers would undermine vital efforts to ensure Leeds upholds its commitments to be carbon neutral by 2030,"" she said, at the time.  The expansion proposals were eventually withdrawn in 2022, with airport bosses citing ""excessive delays"" prompted by local concern over increased aircraft movements - particularly at night - and the decision to refer the scheme to the Secretary of State for a public inquiry.  Airport bosses instead turned their attention to extending the existing terminal, plans for which were approved by Leeds City Council in 2019.  Work began on the project in 2023 and includes the construction of a 102,000 sq ft (9,500 sq m), three-storey extension. The Chief Executive of LBA, Vincent Hodder, has welcomed the government's decision to back expansion at Heathrow. He believes it is ""positive for the UK in general"" and aviation more widely.  ""The Chancellor's announcement yesterday, and her comments today, voices positive support for the aviation industry as a whole,"" said Mr Hodder. ""We've now got a government who understands the role of aviation as an economic accelerator, and are willing to stand behind it and support sustainable growth.  ""Here at LBA, we're looking forward to working in collaboration with our government, our airline partners and our community to ensure we're delivering the world-class facilities Yorkshire deserves.""  However, campaigners protesting the development of Leeds Bradford Airport have contested the chancellor's claims over the link between aviation and economic growth.  Ian Coatman, secretary for GALBA - a group of campaigners based in West Yorkshire who are against the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport - said: ""Claims made about airport expansion being good for the economy are overstated.  ""Flights for business purposes fell by nearly a third between 2019 and 2023, with 3.9 million fewer business trips made - and yet the economy grew by 1.8% over the same period."" He said any government investment would be better spent on renewable energy.  ""I know the government is investing in renewable energy - like wind farms - and that is good news. Surely it's better to do more of that than cause more climate pollution by letting airports expand?  ""It's a lot quicker to create good jobs in renewable energy than by building a new runway."""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79d74nppvpo","Meta to pay $25m to settle Trump lawsuit over ban",2025-01-30,"Peter Hoskins & Natalie Sherman","BBC News","US President Donald Trump has signed a legal settlement that will see Facebook and Instagram owner Meta pay out roughly $25m (£20m). Trump sued the social media giant and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, in 2021 over the suspension of his accounts after the 6 January Capitol riots that year. In July 2024, Meta lifted the final restrictions on Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts in the lead up to US presidential elections. The settlement was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Around $22m of the settlement will go to a fund for Trump's presidential library. The balance will be used to cover legal costs and the other plaintiffs who signed on to the lawsuit. Meta will not admit wrongdoing. The company suspended Trump's accounts in 2021 and said that it would ban him from the platforms for at least two years. After Trump's election victory in November, Mr Zuckerberg visited his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. The move was seen as evidence of an apparent thawing in their once frosty relations. The following month, Meta donated $1m to an inauguration fund for Trump. Mr Zuckerberg was a guest at Trump's inauguration at the US Capitol earlier this month - seated near other global tech billionaires.  For years, Trump had been highly critical of Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook - calling the platform ""anti-Trump"" in 2017. Their relationship soured further after the president's accounts were banned. He called Facebook an ""enemy of the people"" in March 2024. Twitter, which is now named X and owned by Trump ally Elon Musk, also ""permanently"" suspended the president from its platform. After buying the firm for $44bn, Mr Musk reinstated Trump's account in 2022 after a poll he ran on the site narrowly backed the move. Separately on Wednesday, Meta defended its $65bn investment in artificial intelligence (AI) after tech stocks were rocked in the wake of Chinese AI app DeepSeek's sudden rise. Mr Zuckerberg told investors there was a lot to learn from DeepSeek, but it was too soon to have ""a really strong opinion"" about what the app means for the future of AI. ""If anything, I think the recent news has only strengthened our conviction that this is right thing for us to be focused on,"" he added. Many US tech stocks sank this week after DeepSeek surged in popularity, though Meta's has bucked this trend by rising. The stock was up in after hours trading after it posted better than expected financial results on Wednesday. However, questions remain about what advances in Chinese AI will mean for the US AI market generally considering DeepSeek's claim it was developed at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals. Mr Zuckerberg said in a call to investors following the results on Wednesday that DeepSeek's rise strengthened his conviction in his company's embrace of ""open-source"" AI. Meta, parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, took a different tack from many US companies by releasing an open source AI model for free.  Mr Zuckerberg on Wednesday said he thought that approach was important to keeping the US at the cutting edge, as countries around the world compete to become the key players in the still-emerging industry. ""There's going to be an open source standard globally and I think for our own national advantage it's important that it's an American standard,"" he said.  ""We take that seriously. We want to build the AI system that people around the world are using.""  Meta last week announced it was planning to spend as much as $65bn this year to expand its AI infrastructure.  Mr Zuckerberg on Wednesday acknowledged ongoing debate about how best to direct AI investments, but told investors that for his firm, which serves billions of people globally, big investments made sense.  ""I would bet the ability to build out that kind of infrastructure is going to be a major advantage - for both the quality of the service and being able to serve the scale we want to,"" he said.  He said it would also be a critical year for the company in other areas, saying he this year would be key to determining whether sales of the company's smart glasses will take off as hoped. Mr Zuckerberg has said he expects all glasses to be replaced by smart glasses within a decade, a prediction he repeated on Wednesday. He also spoke of plans to revive the ""cultural relevance"" of Facebook, the social media sight that launched his fortune but which has fallen out of favour compared to other offerings such as Instagram and tikTok. Mr Zuckerberg also defended his recently announced decision to end fact-checking, saying he thought plans for community notes would be more effective. He said the company had seen no hit to advertiser demand as a result of its changes. It reported more than $48bn in revenue in the last three months of 2024, up 21% from the same period the prior year. Though AI spending has weighed on the company, it still reported quarterly profit of more than $20bn, up 49% from a year ago."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qw7z2v1pgo","Nvidia shares sink as Chinese AI app spooks markets",2025-01-27,"Peter Hoskins & Imran Rahman-Jones","Business & technology reporters","US tech giant Nvidia lost over a sixth of its value after the surging popularity of a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) app spooked investors in the US and Europe. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot reportedly made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals, launched last week but has already become the most downloaded free app in the US. AI chip giant Nvidia and other tech firms connected to AI, including Microsoft and Google, saw their values tumble on Monday in the wake of DeepSeek's sudden rise. In a separate development, DeepSeek said on Monday it will temporarily limit registrations because of ""large-scale malicious attacks"" on its software.  The DeepSeek chatbot was reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its rivals, raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. Last week, OpenAI joined a group of other firms who pledged to invest $500bn (£400bn) in building AI infrastructure in the US.  President Donald Trump, in one of his first announcements since returning to office, called it ""the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history"" that would help keep ""the future of technology"" in the US. DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m  - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals. But this claim has been disputed by others in AI. The researchers say they use already existing technology, as well as open source code - software that can be used, modified or distributed by anybody free of charge. DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China. To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology. This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before. It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry. After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of ""performance on par with"" one of OpenAI's latest models when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning. Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as ""AI's Sputnik moment"", a reference to the satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off-guard by their rival's technological achievement. DeepSeek's sudden popularity has startled stock markets in Europe and the US. In the US, AI chipmaker Nvidia ended Monday's trading having plunged 16.9% while its rival Broadcom slumped 17.4%. Other tech firms also sank, with Microsoft down 2.14% and Google's owner Alphabet down over 4%. In Europe, Dutch chip equipment maker ASML ended Monday's trading with its share price down by more than 7% while shares in Siemens Energy, which makes hardware related to AI, had plunged by a fifth. ""This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn't necessarily been forefront, so it's taken the market a little bit by surprise,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.  ""So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that's going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they've already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure."" Singapore-based technology equity adviser Vey-Sern Ling told the BBC it could ""potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain"". But Wall Street banking giant Citi cautioned that while DeepSeek could challenge the dominant positions of American companies such as OpenAI, issues faced by Chinese firms could hamper their development. ""We estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US access to more advanced chips is an advantage,"" analysts said in a report. Meanwhile, DeepSeek said on Monday it had been the victim of a cyberattack. ""Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,"" it said in a statement. ""Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support."" The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China.  The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek.  He reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, now banned from export to China.  Experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to launch DeepSeek, by pairing these chips with cheaper, lower-end ones that are still available to import.  Mr Liang was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang.  In a July 2024 interview with The China Academy, Mr Liang said he was surprised by the reaction to the previous version of his AI model.  ""We didn't expect pricing to be such a sensitive issue,"" he said.  ""We were simply following our own pace, calculating costs, and setting prices accordingly.""

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/c0jneed2p8eo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The opportunity to take up a new sport has been a ""breath of fresh air"" for a group of Dublin school children who will represent Ireland at the International NFL Flag Championships in Florida this weekend. The pupils from Greenlanes National School secured their trip to Orlando courtesy of  victory in a qualifying tournament in December and are one of 13 flag football teams who will spend this weekend rubbing shoulders with the elite of the National Football League at the annual Pro Bowl festivities.  The sport, which will be included in the Olympics at LA 2028,  is played in more than 100 countries across the globe and is a non-contact version of American football which, instead of tackling, sees defenders pull a 'flag' from the waist of the attacking player in possession of the ball.  At Greenlanes, the sport has grown quickly from a few children tossing a ball back an forth in the schoolyard to representing Ireland in international competition. ""It all started with these guys who were throwing an American football in the yard. I was just thinking to myself that I'd never seen an American football thrown here before,"" explains their teacher and coach Ciaran Donnelly. ""I had the good fortune that they were coming into the class that I teach this year and the opportunity came about to get involved. ""The guys who were playing already really encouraged everyone to participate, a few others joined, and now it's become really popular. It's fantastic to see different sports being added to the yard."" While some of the children involved were already playing the likes of soccer, rugby and Gaelic games, the NFL has really caught the imagination in the playground.   ""Before we had American football, the only thing we really played at break was soccer,"" says Andrew Drummond, one of the team's wide receivers.  ""So it's been like a breath of fresh air to play a new sport, or [one that is] new to us."" Caitlyn Avery, a running back and wide receiver, admits her parents could not believe the trip to Orlando ""was actually going to happen"" and, indeed, that feeling was shared among some of the players. ""I really liked it when we started playing at break and then Mr Donnelly told us he was trying to get a team,"" says Arnie Copeland, the starting quarterback. ""I never thought I'd be playing for Ireland."" Although most of the squad will move to secondary school later this year, many are keen to keep playing and there are plenty of younger children keen to emulate their success in the coming years. ""These guys are really interested in expanding the game. Some of the parents have been asking already when they go into secondary school will there be opportunities to engage in that,"" added Donnelly.  ""These guys are really inspiring to the younger kids. When they won, we had a nice celebration with them walking through the hallways and even the younger kids who will be coming through Greenlanes, they'll all want to experience something like this. ""It's really great that these guys have shown them what's possible."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7n2jm5m5o","Will young developers take on key open source software?",2025-01-28,"Joe Fay","Technology Reporter","Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts. That’s because he’s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers. It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions every day.  It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away. “I just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,” Mr Stenberg says. It’s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system – and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free. The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today’s technology landscape. In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master’s thesis. “My concern was graduating,” he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project. Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark. “We're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,” he says. While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That’s not just because they’ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world. But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge. Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all. Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the “kernel maintainers are aging”. Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK’s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades. “You've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.” There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s. While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. “The fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.” There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on “plug-ins”, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages. Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the “Rust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.” When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member. Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. “I'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,” he says. And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes. Miss Brock says it’s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate. This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it’s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills. “It's a way to help STEM talent flight,” Miss Brock adds. “Because people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they’re in.” Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there’s “probably less visceral enthusiasm” for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given. And, he continues, “I've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.” Ultimately, he says, there is a “joy, especially for a young person” in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community. “That feeling doesn't get old,” he says. Even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do."

Aviation firm Draken has signed a £173m contract with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to retain its operations at Teesside Airport. Draken's pilots regularly fly against RAF Lightning and Typhoon fighter pilots and act as the enemy force during training drills. Minister for Defence, Procurement and Industry Maria Eagle said the MoD's deal with Draken would support 200 UK jobs and ""ensure the future of Teesside International Airport"". The deal will see Draken deliver Armed Forces training on how to respond to a range of threats, including air-to-air combat, electronic warfare, missile attacks and aerial attacks on ships. Draken's fleet includes 14 Dassault Falcon 20 jets, one Diamond DA42 aircraft and eight L-159E ""Honey Badger"" fighter planes based at Teesside and Bournemouth. It will also hire at least 12 apprentices at both sites. Draken Europe - previously known as Cobham Aviation - has been based at Teesside Airport for more than 25 years.  The company signed a long-term deal to continue operating from the airport in 2020. Two years later a new hangar was opened at the site to house its fleet of Honey Badgers. Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said he was proud to have the company based at the publicly-owned airport. Workers at Draken recently voted to strike as part of a dispute over pay. The strike was held last week and staff are operating on a work-to-rule basis. Follow BBC Tees on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram. Send your story ideas to northeastandcumbria@bbc.co.uk."

While the autonomous Danish territory has been quick to say it isn't for sale, its vast and mostly untapped mineral resources are in great demand. Jagged grey peaks suddenly appear before us, as the motorboat navigates choppy coastal waters and dramatic fjords at Greenland's southern tip. ""Those very high pointy mountains, it's basically a gold belt,"" gestures Eldur Olafsson, the chief executive of mining company Amaroq Minerals. After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold. It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles). ""We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,"" says the Icelandic boss. ""This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits."" The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain. ""See here!"" says Mr Olafsson pointing to a seam of white quartz and a thin dark line. ""Gold, gold, gold. All the way over. Isn't that extraordinary?"" The mine, which Amaroq bought in 2015, had operated for most of the preceding decade, but closed due to then falling gold prices, and high operating costs. Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars. ""We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],"" explains Mr Olafsson. He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched. ""It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,"" adds Mr Olafsson. ""And that is a very unique position."" Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island. Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources. It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt. There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out. Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global ""geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island"". He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies. ""You have a very strong China sitting very heavily on the critical raw materials,"" he says. That has fuelled a growing focus among Western nations to get access to Greenland's minerals. China has also been keen to get involved, but its presence is limited. Reuters recently reported that the US lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland's biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers. Greenland's Minister for Business, Trade and Raw Materials, Naaja Nathanielsen, says that interest in the territory's minerals has ""absolutely increased within the last five years or so"". She adds: ""We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution."" Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one. But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines. Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any ""gold rush"" continues to be slow to materialise. The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (£2.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark. Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism. Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. ""But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded."" Ms Nathanielsen concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the US and EU, ""we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector"". She hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the next decade. However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements. ""It's an arctic terrain,"" says Jakob Kløve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. ""We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine."" Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors. Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time. Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. ""They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,"" she says. Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen Møller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. ""When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?"" Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income ""will leave the country"", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. ""Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing."" It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that ""we need to do business with the US"" and that it was ""doors open in terms of mining"". Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring ""much needed investment"" to the sector. ""On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively."""

Both Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden have been trying for years to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its US operations on national security grounds. It comes as Trump signed an executive order last week to delay a Biden Administration ban on TikTok that briefly took the app offline for its 170m users in the United States. Despite granting TikTok a 75-day reprieve from the ban, Trump had been the first president to start pressuring ByteDance to sell its app. In August 2020, ByteDance approached Microsoft as a possible buyer - something which the US company's chief executive later described as ""the strangest thing"". Later, TikTok chose rival Oracle as a potential partner - although that deal also never happened. Trump has previously said that he was in discussions with several parties about purchasing TikTok and expects to make a decision on the app's future within the next 30 days. A spokesperson for Microsoft said the company had ""nothing to share at this time"". The BBC has also reached out to TikTok for comment.  Earlier on Monday, the US president had addressed a gathering of Republican politicians in Florida and spoke about the proposed sale of TikTok. ""We'll see what happens. We're going to have a lot of people bidding on it,"" he said. ""If we can save all that voice and all the jobs, and China won't be involved, we don't want China involved, but we'll see what happens,"" he added. Previous names linked with buying TikTok include billionaire Frank McCourt and the Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon's Den. The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also claimed he is in the running after a number of investors contacted him following an earlier tweet signalling his interest."

Shares in chip giant Nvidia rose by 8.8%, having slumped on Monday, as experts said the AI selloff may have been an over-reaction.  The market hit came as investors rapidly adjusted bets on AI, after DeepSeek's claim that its model was made at a fraction of the cost of those of its rivals. Analysts said the development raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. US President Donald Trump described the moment as ""a wake-up call"" for the US tech industry, while also suggesting that it could ultimately prove "" a positive"" for the US. ""If you could do it cheaper, if you could do it [for] less [and] get to the same end result. I think that's a good thing for us,"" he told reporters on board Air Force One. He also said he was not concerned about the breakthrough, adding the US will remain a dominant player in the field. Optimism about AI investments has powered much of the boom in US stock markets over the last two years, raising fears of a possible bubble. DeepSeek has become the most downloaded free app in the US just a week after it was launched. Its emergence comes as the US has been warning of a tech race with China, and taking steps to restrict the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China. To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology. This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before. It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry. Nvidia - the company behind the advanced chips that dominate many AI investments, that had seen its share price surge in the last two years due to growing demand - was the hardest hit on Monday. Its share price dropped by roughly 17% on Monday, wiping almost $600bn (£482bn) off its market value.  Janet Mui, head of market analysis at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said investors' first response to something that appears groundbreaking is to sell because of the uncertainty.  But Ms Mui said she expected many companies, like Apple, to benefit if the cost of AI models becomes cheaper.  It could also be a boon for other tech giants, which have faced scrutiny for their high spending on AI. Following the shock to markets in the US on Monday, the main indexes were steady. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3% higher, the S&P 500 rose by almost 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2%. The FTSE 100 stock index of the UK's biggest publicly-listed companies was also steady on Tuesday, closing 0.35% higher. Earlier shares in Japanese AI-related firms including Advantest, Softbank and Tokyo Electron fell sharply, helping to push the benchmark Nikkei 225 down by 1.4%. Several other markets in Asia were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Mainland China's financial markets will be shut from Tuesday and will reopen on 5 February. The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China.  The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek.  He was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang.  In a July 2024 interview with The China Academy, Mr Liang said he was surprised by the reaction to the previous version of his AI model.  ""We didn't expect pricing to be such a sensitive issue,"" he said.  ""We were simply following our own pace, calculating costs, and setting prices accordingly."" After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of ""performance on par with"" one of OpenAI's latest models when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning. DeepSeek's technology has been praised by high profile figures including OpenAI chief Sam Altman who called it ""an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price"", though he added that OpenAI would ""obviously deliver much better models"" moving forward.  ""DeepSeek's ability to rival US models despite limited access to advanced hardware demonstrates that software ingenuity and data efficiency can compensate for hardware constraints,"" said Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, who focuses on China's high-tech industries. Ion Stoica, co-founder and executive chair of AI software company Databricks, told the BBC the lower cost of DeepSeek could spur more companies to adopt AI in their business. ""If that happens, this reduction in cost can accelerate the progress of AI,"" he said. ""So overall, the market will expand faster, and the value of the market will grow faster."" The Chinese company claims its model can be trained on 2,000 specialised chips compared to an estimated 16,000 for leading models. But not everyone is convinced. Some have cast doubt on some of DeepSeek's claims, including tech mogul Elon Musk.  He responded to a post which claimed that DeepSeek actually has around 50,000 Nvidia chips that have now been banned from export to China, saying: ""Obviously."" The sudden explosion in popularity has prompted some to raise cyber security concerns. In Australia, science minister Ed Husic was among the experts urging caution, telling Australia's national broadcaster ABC: ""There are a lot of questions that will need to be answered in time on quality, consumer preferences, data and privacy management.

Lifeboat volunteers made four trips to bring the group from Worm's Head, off the Gower, to safety in Rhossili on Saturday. The group of American students - made up of five women and two men -  had been spending some time at Swansea University and decided to make the trip to the island but were cut off by the incoming tide. Jon Tarrant, one of the volunteer crew, said it was a ""challenging rescue"", adding: ""The swell was up to two metres and the rise and fall of the water presented difficulties in picking up the people and also returning them to shore at Rhossili."" The RNLI team said the students were  ""extremely grateful"" and ""could not believe that all the crew were unpaid volunteers"". Worm's Head is usually accessible on foot for two hours and 30 minutes either side of low tide, but can close earlier due to strong winds accelerating the arrival of high tide. Lawrie Grove, lifeboats operation manager, said its opening times were displayed near to the causeway. ""I would remind people when walking on or near the coast to make sure that they check local tide times and plan walks accordingly,"" he added. ""They should never try to swim or wade to shore when cut off by the tide, it is extremely dangerous."" It is not the first time students have had to be rescued from Worm's Head, with a group of eight becoming stranded in October."

The move by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to raise its short-term policy rate to ""around 0.5 per cent"" comes just hours after the latest economic data showed prices rose last month at the fastest pace in 16 months. The BOJ's last interest rate hike in July, along with a weak jobs report from the US, caught investors around the world by surprise, which triggered a stock market selloff.  The bank's governor, Kazuo Ueda, signalled this latest rate hike in advance in a bid to avoid another market shock. According to official figures released on Friday, core consumer prices in Japan increased by 3% in December from a year earlier. The decision marks the BOJ's first rate hike since July and came just days after Donald Trump returned to the White House. During the election campaign Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all imports into the US, which could have an impact on exporting countries like Japan. By raising rates now the bank will have more scope to cut rates in the future if it needs to boost the economy. The move highlights the central bank's plans to steadily increase rates to around 1% - a level seen as neither boosting or slowing the economy. The BOJ signalled that interest rates will continue to rise from ultra-low levels.  Neil Newman, the head of strategy at Astris Advisory Japan said: ""rates will continue to rise as wages increase, inflation remains above 2% and there is some growth in the economy."" ""We look for another 25-basis point hike in six months,"" said Stefan Angrick, a Japan economist at Moody's Analytics. Last year, the BOJ raised the cost of borrowing for the first time since 2007 after rates had been kept down for years as the country struggled with stagnant price growth.  That hike meant that there were no longer any countries left with negative interest rates. When negative rates are in force people have to pay to deposit money in a bank. They have been used by several countries as a way of encouraging people to spend their money rather than putting it in a bank."

Karim Khan said there were reasonable grounds to suspect Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani bore criminal responsibility for crimes against humanity on gender grounds. ICC judges will now decide whether to issue the warrants.  The Taliban said it strongly condemned the accusations as ""baseless"" and politically motivated, accusing the court of ""double standards"". The ICC investigates and brings to justice those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute. In a statement, Mr Khan said the two men were ""criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women, as well as persons whom the Taliban perceived as not conforming with their ideological expectations of gender identity or expression, and persons whom the Taliban perceived as allies of girls and women"". Opposition to the Taliban government is ""brutally repressed through the commission of crimes including murder, imprisonment, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, enforced disappearance, and other inhumane acts"", he added. The persecution was committed from at least 15 August 2021 until the present day, across Afghanistan, the statement said. But the Taliban's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded with a statement saying the court had turned a blind eye to what it described as ""numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by foreign forces and their local allies"", referring to US-led forces present in the country before 2021. ""It is regrettable that such unfounded claims are being made against the honorable leaders of the Islamic Emirate at a time when peace has finally been restored in Afghanistan,"" it said.  ""The Afghan people, after years of suffering, have only recently begun to experience relief from the chaos of private prisons, abductions, warlords and other inhumane practices."" Rights group Amnesty International welcomed the ICC move. In a statement, Secretary-General Agnès Callamard said the announcement ""gives hope, inside and outside the country to Afghan women, girls, as well as those persecuted on the basis of gender identity or expression"". But Ms Callamard also called on the ICC prosecutor to ""reconsider his 2021 decision to deprioritise investigations"" into alleged war crimes by international forces and the former government security apparatus, which could give the impression of a selective approach to international justice. Akhundzada became the supreme commander of the Taliban in 2016, and is now leader of the so-called Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In the 1980s, he participated in Islamist groups fighting against the Soviet military campaign in Afghanistan. Haqqani was a close associate of Taliban founder Mullah Omar and served as a negotiator on behalf of the Taliban during discussions with US representatives in 2020. The ICC prosecutor's office told the BBC that issues slowed down the pace of the investigation, including ""the lack of cooperation"" from the Taliban authorities.  ""Due to fear, individuals with important information for the investigation are frequently unwilling to come forward,"" the office added.  Nader Nadery, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Wilson Center who participated in peace talks between the previous Afghan government and the Taliban, said that many Afghan women had been waiting for this moment.  ""While it might not immediately change things, it sends a strong message that there won't be impunity,"" he told the BBC.  ""It builds hope for many of those activists and Afghan women on the ground that probably there is a way forward and keeping that hope alive, I believe, is a major contribution immediately."" The Taliban regained power in Afghanistan in 2021, 20 years after a US-led invasion toppled their regime in the fallout of the 9/11 attacks in New York, but its government has not been formally recognised by any other foreign power. ""Morality laws"" have since meant women have lost dozens of rights in the country. Afghanistan is now the only country in the world where women and girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education - some one-and-a-half million have been deliberately deprived of schooling. The Taliban has repeatedly promised they would be re-admitted to school once a number of issues were resolved - including ensuring the curriculum was ""Islamic"". This has yet to happen. Beauty salons have been shut down and women are prevented from entering public parks, gyms and baths. A dress code means they must be fully covered and strict rules have banned them from travelling without a male chaperone or looking a man in the eye unless they're related by blood or marriage. In December, women were also banned from training as midwives and nurses, effectively closing off their last route to further education in the country."

Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires – a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon. Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith – a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil. Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out. “We’ve tested everything we can on Earth now,” says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. “The next step is going to the moon.” Sierra Space’s experiment unfolded at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center in the summer of 2024. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base. Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield – including Mars. Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface. Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not. “It could save billions of dollars from mission costs,” says Mr White as he explains that the alternative – bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth – would be arduous and expensive. Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions. The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space’s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures. The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. “It gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,” says Mr White. And the one, crucial, thing that you can’t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity – which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions. The moon’s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University. In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon’s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly. The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. “It is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,” says Dr Burke. “Those bubbles aren’t going to rise as fast – and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.” There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free. And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this. Sierra Space’s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White. Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut’s fitness and activity levels. However, a lunar base’s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn’t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive. The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration. Obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better.  Sierra Space’s system does require the addition of some carbon, though the firm says it can recycle most of this after each oxygen-producing cycle. Along with colleagues, Palak Patel, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came up with an experimental molten regolith electrolysis system, for extracting oxygen and metal from the lunar soil. “We’re really looking at it from the standpoint of, ‘Let’s try to minimise the number of resupply missions’,” she says. When designing their system, Ms Patel and her colleagues addressed the problem described by Dr Burke: that low gravity could impede the detachment of oxygen bubbles that form on electrodes. To counter this, they used a “sonicator”, which blasts the bubbles with sound waves in order to dislodge them. Ms Patel says that future resource-extracting machines on the moon could derive iron, titanium or lithium from regolith, for example. These materials might help lunar-dwelling astronauts make 3D-printed spare parts for their moon base or replacement components for damaged spacecraft. The usefulness of lunar regolith does not stop there. Ms Patel notes that, in separate experiments, she has melted simulated regolith into a tough, dark, glass-like material. She and colleagues worked out how to turn this substance into strong, hollow bricks, which could be useful for building structures on the moon – an imposing black monolith, say. Why not?"

Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC that the US has no goods trade deficit with the UK, which occurs when a country imports more than it exports. President Trump has doubled down on his threat to impose big tariffs on countries that sell products in the US. ""I think we've got an argument to engage with,"" Reynolds said. The BBC asked whether the UK would be exempt from tariffs, given the absence of a trade deficit between the two nations. The president did not respond directly and instead spoke about the trading deficit the US and Canada have and his plans to rectify that.  The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because it will make it more expensive for companies to sell goods in the world's largest economy. Trump told global executives at the World Economic Forum on this week that they could either produce their goods in the US or face widespread tariffs worth hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. But Reynolds said when it comes to manufactured goods, the US did not have a trade deficit with the UK.  ""We know this is something that not just President Trump, but the whole of his administration takes very seriously,"" he said. ""We've obviously got a services-based economy. The US does not have that deficit with us so if that's the logic of that position, I think we've got an argument to engage with."" Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue but he also uses them as leverage to pursue other policies. He has already said he is considering imposing a 10% tax on imports from China as soon as 1 February, claiming the country is sending fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, to Mexico and Canada.   Trump had also threatened 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, again citing fentanyl as well as immigration among his concerns.  However, Trump has since said he ""would rather not"" impose tariffs, suggesting a trade deal could be on the table. Separately, the business secretary said the UK had left open the possibility of following EU rules for food and farm products in order to return to frictionless access to European markets. Reynolds said such an agreement - which lowers all trade barriers in return for mirroring EU rules and standards - would not cross the government's red lines. The comments came after EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic told the BBC a new agreement, including so-called dynamic alignment on standards, is possible alongside other areas of pan-European co-operation on customs. Reynolds said Sefcovic's tone was in keeping with what the government had already said about a ""twin-track strategy"" on trade.  ""We can improve the terms of trade with the EU in a way which doesn't revisit customs unions or single markets or the arguments of Brexit, and we can do that whilst pursuing closer trade links around the world,"" Reynolds said. Labour fought last year's UK general election with a manifesto pledge to lower Brexit-related barriers and red tape for the export of food and farm products to the European Union. The question has always been how deep such an agreement might be. It could be settled in the coming weeks, though firm decisions have not yet been made. The Conservatives have voiced anger at reports of a potential new deal on UK-EU trade, with shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel telling MPs that the government was ""bending the knee to the EU"". The Liberal Democrats have said the government is not doing enough to smooth trade with the EU."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5g48yx0dvo","EU 'could consider' UK joining pan-Europe customs scheme",2025-01-23,"Faisal Islam & Dearbail Jordan","Economics editor and business reporter•@faisalislam","The European Union's new trade chief responsible for post-Brexit negotiations has told the BBC a ""pan-European [customs] area is something we could consider"" as part of ""reset"" discussions between the UK and EU. Maros Sefcovic referred to the idea of Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).    These are common rules that allow parts and ingredients for manufacturing supply chains to be sourced from across dozens of countries in and around Europe and North Africa to be used in tariff-free trade. Downing Street has indicated such an agreement would not cross the government's ""red lines"" for its relationship with the EU. The BBC understands the UK government has begun consultations with business over the benefits of the PEM plan that could help cut red tape and improve trade. No final decision has been made yet. The Conservatives did not pursue PEM as part of its post-Brexit deal, but some  businesses have said it will help the UK rejoin complex supply chains that have been hit by customs barriers. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Sefcovic said the idea has not been ""precisely formulated"" by London yet and the ""ball is in the UK's court"". Under the Brexit deal, UK goods sold to the bloc are not subject to tariffs provided they are made with a certain percentage of materials from Britain or the EU. If a UK clothing manufacturer makes garments mainly from textiles it has sourced from Turkey - which is not in the EU - and sells them into the EU, the firm importing the goods would pay a tariff. But if the UK joined the PEM Convention - of which Turkey is a member - the firm buying the products would not pay tariffs.  William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said joining PEM ""would reduce paperwork and costs for many UK firms as it would align rules and regulations on both sides in relation to the sourcing of components and raw materials used in exports"". Speaking at Cabinet Office Questions, Europe Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""We don't currently have any plans to join PEM."" However, a Number 10 spokesman did not rule out future membership of PEM. ""The arrangement that's been discussed is not a customs union,"" he said, when asked if PEM membership would cross the red lines set out in Labour's manifesto for EU ties.  ""Our red line has always been that we will never join a single market, freedom of movement, but we're just not going to get ahead of those discussions."" Dame Emily Thornberry, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said the post-Brexit agreement negotiated by the Tories had ""all kinds of holes"" in it. ""Within that agreement there is a mechanism for improving it, and we need to seize that opportunity,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""We need to make sure that within the constraints of the vote to leave the European Union, we nevertheless do everything that we can to get rid of barriers to trade with our nearest neighbours and the people who we trade with the most."" Mr Sefcovic also said that a full-scale veterinary agreement that helped reduce frictions on farm and food trade should be reviewed. Single market treatment for UK food and farm exports would mean ""we would have to have the same rules and we have to upgrade them at the same time, we call it dynamic alignment"", he said. Dame Emily described the current agreement as ""uneven and difficult"". ""At the moment the reality is that for reasons of capacity, food coming in from the EU isn't really checked and yet food from Britain is checked a lot going into the EU,"" she said. The EU-UK fisheries deal is also due to expire next year. ""A solution for fisheries is very important for the EU, again, we communicated this on multiple occasions,"" Mr Sefcovic said. He also said he was surprised at how a European Commission proposal on youth mobility had been ""spun"" in the UK. The scheme would allow 18 to 30 year-olds from the EU to travel, work and study in the UK for a period, ""with reciprocity for young UK nationals"", according to the European Commission.  Both Labour, when it was in opposition, and the then-Tory government rejected the idea, stating that free movement within the EU had ended with Brexit. But Mr Sefcovic said it was hoped the scheme would ""build bridges for the future for the European Union and the UK"". ""That was the idea,"" he said. ""[But] we've been a little bit surprised what kind of spin it got in the UK. ""It is not freedom of movement,"" Mr Sefcovic added. ""We have been very clear what we've been proposing.""  Nevertheless, Mr Sefcovic said that relations between the UK and the EU were ""definitely"" in a better place and his British counterpart Nick Thomas-Symonds was ""on speed dial"". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will attend a defence and security focused EU summit next month.  As well as relations with the UK, Mr Sefcovic acknowledged that the EU needed to be ""extremely cautious and responsible"" in addressing trade with the Trump administration in Washington but said he was willing to negotiate.  He added that while the EU did have a surplus in goods such as cars, the US had a surplus in services.

Simon Renoldi, Matthew Hutchinson and Iain Green were caught after police cracked EncroChat, an encrypted international communication service. The defendants, from Essex, were later linked with more than £1m in cash seized from various properties. They were jailed at Basildon Crown Court having been found guilty of a series of drug offences in November. It followed intelligence shared by law enforcement agencies from England, France and the Netherlands. Having cracked EncroChat in April 2020, police found Renoldi, Green and Hutchinson were using the pseudonyms ""Typicalknee"", ""Harshwater"" and ""Pineappletequila"" respectively. The messages showed Hutchinson was involved in shipping cocaine and ketamine to New Zealand and Australia, Essex Police said. While police were covertly watching them, Renoldi and Green met to exchange more than £140,000 in cash, the force added. It was officers' belief that Green and Hutchinson both owed ""tens of thousands of pounds"" to Renoldi. During the investigation, police raided an address in Basildon and found £805,000 in cash and 5kg of cocaine. They also found a notebook leading them to The Railway Tavern in Stanford-le-Hope, where Renoldi was found to have been stashing £68,950.

Company veteran Tim Noel will take charge of the largest health insurer in the US, which has more than 50 million customers, at a critical moment. Mr Thompson's killing on 4 December in central Manhattan ignited a wide debate about how the US healthcare system operates. Many Americans, who pay more for healthcare than people in any other country, have expressed anger over what they see as unfair treatment by insurance firms. Mr Noel ""brings unparalleled experience to this role with a proven track record and strong commitment to improving how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners,"" UnitedHealthcare's parent company UnitedHealth Group said. A manhunt ensued for days as police worked to identify who was responsible in the December killing, which happened outside a Manhattan hotel where the CEO was staying.  After five days, Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested in a McDonald's restaurant in Pennsylvania after a worker called police. Mr Mangione has pleaded not guilty to charges in the killing. He is facing 11 state criminal counts, including murder as an act of terrorism. As well as the state-level charges, he is also accused of federal - national-level - stalking and murder offences that could lead to a death penalty sentence.

The external area, located in the airport's departure lounge after security, was accessible at a charge of £1. However on Wednesday, the airport said it has been left with ""no option"" but to close the area due to attacks. ""We will be keeping the situation under review as we progress with our building works,"" a spokesperson said. The airport added that smoking will only be permitted in designated areas and in front of the terminal building. It was the last airport in Northern Ireland to have a smoking area within the terminal, with no facilities available at Belfast City Airport or City of Derry Airport. Nicky Crancher from Bournemouth, who often travels, said he thinks the airport should keep the area closed. ""I think people who are travelling could smoke in different areas in the airport or outside and it just discourages people from starting smoking at all,"" he said. Meanwhile, Jonathan Devine said the closure of the space would be difficult for smokers who are travelling for a long time. ""Having to go through airport security, and then having to wait about two hours for  a flight without a cigarette I'd imagine you would be pretty agitated,"" he added.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4m84d2xz2o","Tech giants are putting $500bn into 'Stargate' to build up AI in US",2025-01-22,"João da Silva, Natalie Sherman & Imran Rahman-Jones","Business reporters & technology reporter","The creator of ChatGPT, OpenAI, is teaming up with another US tech giant, a Japanese investment firm and an Emirati sovereign wealth fund to build $500bn (£405bn) of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in the United States.  The new company, called The Stargate Project, was announced at the White House by President Donald Trump who billed it ""the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history"" and said it would help keep ""the future of technology"" in the US. But Elon Musk - both a top adviser to Trump and rival to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman - on Wednesday said the venture does not ""actually have the money"" it has pledged to invest. Investment in AI is currently exploding, driving demand for new data centres while also raising concerns about the huge amounts of water and power the facilities require. The venture is a partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, Japan's Softbank - led by Masayoshi Son - and MGX, a tech investment arm of the United Arab Emirates government. The companies said the new venture, which was in the works before Trump took office, had $100bn in funding available immediately, with the rest to come over four years, creating an estimated 100,000 jobs. Commenting on a post on X where OpenAI detailed the plans, Musk, who owns the platform, wrote ""They don't actually have the money."" ""SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority,"" he added.  Musk, however, did not provide any details or substantiation for how he had arrived at the much smaller amount. Altman then replied: ""Wrong, as you surely know."" ""Want to come visit the first site already under way?"" Altman added. ""This is great for the country. I realize what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you'll mostly put US first."" Musk is spearheading Trump's government efficiency efforts and will closely advise Trump on spending. He, though, has also been feuding with Altman since leaving OpenAI's board in 2018 and launching his own AI start-up. A source close to Stargate said it was not clear where Musk had gotten his information and that the company was well-positioned to deploy $100 bn. Stargate's first data centre is under construction in Texas, according to Oracle's chief technology officer, Larry Ellison, and more will be built in other US locations. ""I think this will be the most important project of this era,"" said Altman at Trump's Tuesday announcement, standing alongside the President at the White House. ""We wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr President,"" he added, even though the project was underway before Trump won November's election. The US is already the world leader in AI investment, vastly outspending any other country, and its big tech companies have been making major investments into data centres in the last year.  Microsoft, one of the OpenAI's major backers, said earlier this month it was on track to invest $80bn to build out AI-focused data centres this year.  It is also involved in a $100bn venture that includes BlackRock and MGX and is focused on making AI data centre investments.  Amazon has been pouring money into the centres at a similar scale, announcing two projects worth about $10bn each in just the last two months. In a report last year, McKinsey said that global demand for data centre capacity would more than triple by 2030, growing between 19% and 27% annually by 2030.  For developers to meet that demand, the consultancy estimated that at least twice the capacity would have to be built by 2030 as has been constructed since 2000. But analysts have warned that the process is likely to be bogged down by issues such as power and land constraints and permitting. Trump, who has claimed credit for fostering business investment, promised he would intervene to help the industry. ""I'm going to help a lot through emergency declarations because we have an emergency,"" he said, stressing the importance of keeping AI in the US. Trump said his government would ""make it possible for them to get that production done very easily."" OpenAI has long called for more investment into data centres for AI. The Information, a technology news website, first reported on the Stargate project in March last year. Other technology partners include British chipmaker Arm, US chipmaker Nvidia and Microsoft, which already has a partnership with OpenAI. Along with Musk's scepticism about funding for the specific project, there are growing concerns generally about the data centres taxing energy supplies and questions about the role of foreign investors.   In one of his final acts in the White House, former President Joe Biden put forward rules that would restrict exports of AI-related chips to dozens of countries around the world, saying the move would help the US control the industry.   He also issued orders related to the development of data centres on government land, which spotlighted a role for clean energy in powering the centres."

Under a strange pink-purple glow, illuminated panels buzz and cylindrical columns of water bubble away as a futuristic crop of microalgae grows. It's here that Iceland's Vaxa Technologies has developed a system that harnesses energy and other resources from the nearby power plant to cultivate these tiny aquatic organisms. “It's a new way of thinking about food production,” says general manager Kristinn Haflidason as he gives me a tour of the space-age facility. For much of our history, humans have consumed seaweed, also known as macroalgae. But its tiny relative, microalgae has been a less common food source, although it was eaten for centuries in ancient Central America and Africa. Now scientists and entrepreneurs are increasingly exploring its potential as a nutrition-rich, sustainable food. About 35 minutes from the capital Reykjavik, the Vaxa site produces the microalgae Nannochloropsis, both as food for people, and for feed in fish and shrimp farming. It also grows a type of bacteria called Arthospira, also known as blue-green algae, as it shares similar properties with microalgae. When dried out it is known as spirulina and is used as a dietary supplement, a food ingredient, and as a bright-blue food colouring. These tiny organisms photosynthesise, capturing energy from light to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.  “The algae is eating CO2, or turning the CO2 into biomass,” explains Mr Haflidason. “It's carbon negative.” Vaxa's plant has a unique situation. It's the only place where algae cultivation is integrated with a geothermal power station, which supplies clean electricity, delivers cold water for cultivation, hot water for heating, and even pipes across its CO2 emissions. “You end up with a slightly negative carbon footprint,” says Asger Munch Smidt-Jensen, a food technology consultant at Danish Technology Institute (DTI), who co-authored a study assessing the environmental impact of Vaxa’s spirulina production. “We also found a relatively low footprint, both in terms of land and water use.” Round-the-clock renewable energy, plus a stream of CO2, and nutrients with a low carbon footprint, are needed to ensure the setup is climate-friendly, and he thinks that isn’t easily replicated. “There is a huge input of energy to run these photo-bioreactors, and you have to artificially simulate the sun, so you need a high energy light source,” he explains. ""My main takeaway is that we should utilise these areas [like Iceland] where we have low impact energy sources to make energy intensive products,” adds Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen. Back at the algae plant, I climb onto an elevated platform, where I’m surrounded by noisy modular units called photo-bioreactors, where thousands upon thousands of tiny red and blue LED lights fuel the microalgae’s growth, in place of sunlight.  They’re also supplied water and nutrients. “More than 90% of the photosynthesis happens within very specific wavelengths of red and blue light,” explains Mr Haflidason. “We are only giving them the light that they use.” All the conditions are tightly controlled and optimised by machine learning, he adds. About 7% of the crop is harvested daily and rapidly replenished by new growth. Vaxa’s facility can produce up to 150 metric tonnes of algae annually and it plans to expand. As the crops are rich in protein, carbohydrates, omega-3s, fatty-acids, and vitamin B12, Mr Haflidason believes growing microalgae this way could help tackle global food insecurity. Many other companies are betting on the potential of microalgae - it's estimated the market will be worth $25.4bn (£20.5bn) by 2033. Danish start-up Algiecel has been trialling portable shipping container-sized modules that house photo-bioreactors, and which could link up to carbon-emitting industries to capture their CO2, while simultaneously producing food and feed. Crops are also being used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biofuel and a replacement for plastic.  Perhaps also microalgae could be produced in space. In a project funded by the European Space Agency, the Danish Technological Institution plans to test if a microalgae can be grown on the International Space Station. Despite all the investment, there’s some way to go before microalgae becomes an everyday part of our diet. It still needs a lot of development, according to Mr Munch Smidt-Jensen. He points out that the texture lacks firmness. Meanwhile the taste can be ""fishy"" if the algae is a saltwater variety.  “But there are ways of overcoming this,” he adds. There’s also the societal question. “Are people ready for it? How do we make it so that everyone wants to eat this?"" Malene Lihme Olsen, a food scientist at Copenhagen University who researches micro algae, says its nutritional value needs more research. ""Green microalgae [chlorella] have a very robust cell wall, so it can be difficult for us to digest and get all the nutrients,” she says. For now she says microalgae is better added to other “carrier products” like pasta or bread to help with taste, texture and appearance. However, Ms Olsen believes microalgae are a promising future food. “If you compare one hectare of soy in Brazil, and imagine we had one hectare of algae field, you could produce 15 times more protein a year [from the algae].” Back at the plant I'm looking at an unappetising green sludge. It's the harvested microalgae with the water squeezed out, ready for further processing.  Mr Haflidason offers me a taste and, after initial reluctance, I try some and find its flavour neutral with a texture like tofu. “We are absolutely not proposing that anyone should eat green sludge,” jokes Mr Haflidason. Instead the processed algae is an ingredient for everyday foods, and in Reykjavik one bakery makes bread with Spirulina and a gym puts it in smoothies. “We’re not going to change what you eat. We're just going to change the nutritional value of the foods that you eat,” he says."

Trump said discussions with his administration were ""based on the fact that they're sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada"". He called China an ""abuser"". China responded saying trade wars have ""no winners"". Despite the aggressive talk, the 10% tariff would be much less than the 60% tariff Trump mentioned on the campaign trail. Trump's comments followed his threats to levy import taxes of 25% on Mexico and Canada, accusing them of allowing undocumented migrants and drugs to come into the US. In a press conference in Washington on Tuesday, Trump also vowed to hit the European Union with tariffs. He said the EU ""treat us very, very badly"".  ""So they're going to be in for tariffs. It's the only way you're going to get back. It's the only way you're going to get fairness.""

""We have always believed that trade wars and tariff wars have no winners,"" she added. Shortly after he was sworn in on Monday, the new president also instructed federal agencies to conduct a review of existing trade deals and identify unfair practices by US trading partners. Meanwhile, a top Chinese official spoke out against protectionism at the World Economic Forum in Davos. China's Vice Premier, Ding Xuexiang, called for a ""win-win"" solution to trade disputes without mentioning the US. The Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised to fight back.  ""If the [US] president does choose to proceed with tariffs, Canada will respond - and everything is on the table,"" Trudeau said. Ottawa is preparing counter-tariffs in response to the threat, reportedly worth billions of dollars. Canada, China and Mexico are the top US trading partners.  Tariffs are an important part of Trump's economic plans. The president believes they can boost growth, protect jobs and raise tax revenue. But many economists say such measures could lead to higher prices for Americans and harm companies hit by foreign retaliation."

That also includes overseeing the heritage scouting strategy for some of the world's most remote footballing nations, including Samoa, Fiji and the Cook Islands. Through the use of artificial intelligence technology, they identify players with qualifying ancestry and connect them to the relevant football association.  Essentially, they are international football matchmakers. In numerous cases, they have uncovered players from thousands of miles away who have no idea of the nations they are eligible to represent.  The success of their work has led to ongoing advanced conversations with nations in Europe, Asia and the Caribbean, as developing football nations in particular attempt to become more competitive. Samoa head coach Jess Ibrom, who has worked with Gurr and McLae in his current role and during his time with the Cook Islands, can attest.  ""It's a way of bridging the gap to the nations above us,"" England-born Ibrom tells BBC Sport. ""A lot of players don't know they're eligible to represent a country. We've found players everywhere and it's really exciting unearthing them."" Gurr, working remotely from Scotland, and New Zealand-based McLae kick-start conversations between players and federations which have led to several senior international breakthroughs. Gurr's experience includes time spent as a coach, scout, and video analyst - but it was a volunteering role for the Football Federation of Samoa, aiding the nation of just 200,000 people in its search for players, which kindled his current venture. ""We're trying to grow this and help as many nations as we can,"" says Gurr. ""With Samoa, from 2021 to 2023 we found over 350 players. We found players in the Manchester City academy that are eligible, players in Spain, Qatar, China, Brazil, New Zealand, Australia.  ""You wouldn't believe where they are."" Gurr estimates that from the players identified as eligible for Samoa, across all age groups in men's and women's football, about 60 debuts have so far been recorded. Their work with the Cook Islands, a nation of just 10,000 people, has identified 50 players and led to 10 debuts in just one year. Samoa coach Ibrom, who last year led the nation to back-to-back World Cup qualifying victories for the first time, said: ""When Alastair reached out to me in 2021, it opened a conversation around what strategy we could develop in Samoa to enhance player identification.  ""Once they're identified, conversations can be facilitated by Alastair and Russ, or it can be as simple as a cold call - just this week I received a message from a potential player in the United States.  ""We've had massive success as a result. Every country is trying to do this now to compete at a high level on the international stage. It has really positively impacted the Samoa football federation."" So, how do they do it? Gurr and McLae developed their own AI heritage scouting system, allowing them to identify possible candidates through their extensive database and determine the probability of which nations a player could be eligible for. Combined with time-honoured, traditional scouting methods through their own research team, their standing in the sport has grown to the extent that they have even assisted popular video game Football Manager in updating its own database in the regions the pair operate in. ""About 50% of the players don't know they are even eligible,"" says Gurr. ""There's not one way to go about it, it depends on what the federation wants and how they want to operate. For example, with Samoa, because a big part of our focus was on youth players, we could go public and do a lot of work in communities. ""If you're after a professional player, you probably want things to be a bit more discreet. We can do both. We're speaking with bigger nations at the moment. ""Elite football is quite small, so once you're well thought of, you can get a good network quite quickly. But the other part of the process is being credible and having the ability to strike up a relationship with a player, parent or club."" One success story is that of Pharrell Trainor, who was identified as a teenager while at Australian club Newcastle Jets. The 18-year-old, who now plays his club football in Germany, has since progressed through Samoa's youth sides before breaking into the senior squad for last year’s World Cup qualifying campaign. And while Samoa men's team achieved a nine-year high in the Fifa rankings in 2024, the work of Gurr and McLae has impacted at all levels.  Of the women's squad who have qualified for the Under-17 tournament in Morocco later this year - the first time Samoa has ever reached a Fifa World Cup tournament at any level - 10 players were identified by them. Their most recent partnership with Fiji has so far connected them to players in England, the United States, Germany and Australia.  With smaller nations keen to explore such routes to help take them to the next level, it is hoped that expansion into federations in Europe, Asia and the Caribbean will soon provide further success stories. ""We've had a really good reaction because we don't push a pathway to anyone. We purely tell them they're eligible and inform the federation that this player is eligible,"" Gurr explains. ""It's up to the player if they want to go down that avenue, and then it's up to the federation if they want to select the player. ""A lot of the time, the players are really excited to have that pathway open up to them.  “A lot of them are excited to reconnect with that heritage."""

The three main US indexes ended the day higher, while shares in Europe and Asia also made modest gains. While Trump did not announce widespread tariffs, he has ordered a review US trade deals, in a possible step toward the border taxes as well as threatening Canada and Mexico with 25% from 1 February.  The International Monetary Fund and analysts have warned that Trump policies threaten a significant disruption of global trade that could eventually backfire on the US. But some of Trump's policies such as cuts to government regulations are seen as positive for business.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 1.2%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.8% and the Nasdaq rose 0.6%. The dollar, which had fallen on Monday after the inauguration, swung up and down against some other major currencies, including the pound and the euro, as uncertainty lingered about what policies might become reality. Trump had previously threatened new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on day one of his presidency. While they did not materialise on Monday, they are still on the agenda. ""We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people, Canada's a very bad abuser also, vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. In a presidential memo, he directed federal agencies to investigate why America continues to import more goods than it exports as well as probing potential unfair trade practices and alleged currency manipulation by other countries. Trump also said new tariffs on China could depend on whether a deal is reached over TikTok's future. If Beijing blocked such an agreement ""it would be somewhat of a hostile act"", he said. But he said the US is not yet ready to impose tariffs on all imports into the country. During the election campaign, Trump pledged a universal tariff of 10% and said he would hit China with a 60% import tax. He has said tariffs will make Americans richer, although critics say the costs are likely to be passed on to consumers. The president has also said he would create an ""External Revenue Service"" to collect all tariffs, duties and revenues from foreign sources. In Europe, London's FTSE 100 and Paris's Cac 40 both closed marginally higher. Danish offshore wind giant Orsted was a big loser, with its shares down as much as 17%, after announcing a $1.7bn (£1.4bn) impairment charge on delays to a US project and after Trump said he would end leasing to wind farms. In the currency markets ""plans and discussions of levies on Canada and Mexico saw those currencies fall sharply,"" Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, told the BBC's Today programme. Oil fell on the prospect of more supply, and Bitcoin was higher due to Trump's pledges of support for cryptocurrencies. Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at financial services firm KCM Trade, said ""market sentiment was dented during the signing of executive orders by President Trump in the Oval Office"". ""Investors heard more explicit details regarding the Trump tariff agenda, which sullied the market mood somewhat."" Other analysts warned that Trump's return to the White House will reintroduce an element of unpredictability in the markets. ""The first few hours of the Trump administration have underscored that policy environment will be dynamic once again and markets should brace for volatility,"" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment bank Saxo. Trump adviser Judy Shelton said Trump's ""main priority is to re-energise the private sector"". He wants to ""unleash the individual through more economic liberty, through lower taxes, through less regulation"", she said. She said tariffs were ""a very effective negotiating tool"" and it will be used ""with our closest neighbours and largest trade partners Mexico and Canada"" with regard to  immigration. She said tariffs would not necessarily be inflationary for Americans - people may not pay higher prices for imported goods, and instead turn to US producers."

The announcement comes after President-elect Donald Trump launched the $Trump cryptocurrency. Both coins have risen but have seen volatile trade. ""The Official Melania Meme is live! You can buy $Melania now,"" she posted on the social platform X on Sunday. Disclaimers on the websites of both the $Trump and $Melania coins said they were ""not intended to be, or the subject of"" an investment opportunity or a security. According to the CoinMarketCap website, $Trump has a total market valuation of about $12bn (£9.8bn), while $Melania's stands at around $1.7bn. Trump had previously called crypto a ""scam"" but during the 2024 election campaign became the first presidential candidate to accept digital assets as donations. During the campaign, his family launched a cryptocurrency company called World Liberty Financial - which aims to lead ""a financial revolution by dismantling the stranglehold of traditional financial institutions"", and is also selling a crypto coin. The new Trump coin was launched from Trump Organization affiliate CIC Digital LLC, which is linked to previous sales of crypto collectable NFTs launched in 2022 that made millions of dollars but have since fallen dramatically in value for their owners.  According to CoinGecko, the NFTs once sold for more than $1,000 but have since dropped in value to around $300. On the campaign trail, Trump also said he would create a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appoint financial regulators that take a more positive stance towards digital assets. That spurred expectations that he would strip back regulations on the crypto industry. In the wake of Trump's victory, Bitcoin jumped to a record high of around $109,000 according to crypto trading platform Coinbase. On Friday, the incoming artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto tsar David Sacks held a  ""Crypto Ball"" in Washington, DC. Other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin - which has been promoted by high-profile Trump supporter Elon Musk - have also risen sharply this year. Under President Joe Biden, regulators cited concerns about fraud and money laundering as they cracked down on crypto companies by suing exchanges. The growth of Dogecoin has significantly increased the interest in so-called ""meme coins"" - cryptocurrencies typically linked to a viral internet trend or moment. Melania's Meme coin has come from her own incorporated company MKT World LLC – a firm she has used since 2021 for various ventures including selling portraits of her as first lady. Meme coins can be created and launched by anyone, and there are thousands in existence. With their profile and social media presence, Trump coin and Melania coin have already entered the top 100 coins in terms of value, and Melania's coin is now worth more than AI entrepreneur Sam Altman's Worldcoin.

He says during that time, the US will not enforce the law passed by Congress last year and signed by former President Joe Biden. The order was among a slew of directives Trump signed on Monday evening. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, he said: ""I tell you what. Every rich person has called me about TikTok."" When asked by a reporter why he's had a change of heart since trying to ban TikTok in 2020, Trump responded: ""Because I got to use it."" He floated the possibility of a joint venture running the company, saying he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between ""the United States"" and its Chinese owner ByteDance. But he did not give any further details on how that might work. Trump also said he may impose new trade tariffs on China if a deal for the platform is not struck.  If Beijing rejected a deal ""it would be somewhat of a hostile act"", he said. Chinese officials have previously rejected calls for a sale, describing US arguments last March as ""sheer robbers' logic"". However, on Tuesday the spokesperson for the foreign ministry appeared to soften that stance. ""When it comes to actions such as the operation and acquisition of businesses, we believe they should be independently decided by companies,"" Guo Jiakun said.  ""If it involves Chinese companies, China's laws and regulations should be observed,"" he added. On Saturday evening, the Chinese-owned app stopped working for American users, as a law banning it on national security grounds was set to come into effect. It resumed services to its 170 million users in the US after Trump said he would issue an executive order to give the app a reprieve when he took office. But on Monday it was still not available to download from the Apple and Google app stores. The Biden administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation. Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, previously ignored a law requiring it to sell its US operations to avoid a ban.  The law was upheld by Supreme Court on Friday and went into effect on Sunday, but the Biden White House said it would leave implementing the law to the incoming administration given the timing. Trump had backed a ban of the platform during his first term in office. The newly signed executive order places him at odds with many members of Congress from his own party.  On Sunday in a post on X, Republican Senator Tom Cotton said any company that ""hosts, distributes, services or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok"" could face hundreds of billions of dollars in fines. Cotton said liability could stem not just from the Department of Justice, ""but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs [attorneys general]. Think about it"". TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew attended Trump's inauguration on Monday along with other bosses of big technology firms, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos. Earlier on Monday, YouTube star MrBeast posted a TikTok video of him apparently from a private jet on his way to make an official offer to buy the short video platform. The post gave no other details about the offer, only that it would be ""crazy"". Other companies, billionaires and celebrities have expressed interest in buying TikTok, including former Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and an investor from the TV show Shark Tank, Kevin O'Leary.

It follows a change of protocol agreed with the Six Nations who previously required both teams to agree for the roof to be closed. The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) say being able to close the retractable roof will guarantee conditions, maintain consistency for players and improve the fan experience.  ""There's no better atmosphere than a packed-out Principality Stadium roaring Wales along,"" said stadium manager Mark Williams. ""In the past we've always come to a mutual agreement with the visiting team on whether the roof remains open or shut, but in this historic move we're maximising one of our greatest assets and the roof will be closed for the next two years of international Welsh rugby fixtures. ""When the roof is shut, the noise is intimidating. It's fantastic for both the fans and players."" The WRU also say both home fixtures in the 2025 Six Nations will be played in front of sell-out 74,000 crowds at the Cardiff venue. Ireland visit the Welsh capital on Saturday, 22 February (14:15 GMT) before Warren Gatland's side host England on Saturday, 15 March (16:45 GMT). ""Selling out both of our home fixtures is an achievement reflective of the excitement building ahead of another thrilling Guinness Six Nations campaign at the world renowned Principality Stadium,"" said WRU chief executive Abi Tierney. ""Both senior men's home fixtures have been in high demand and this is a fantastic achievement and a sign of the passion and belief that Welsh rugby fans have for this team. ""Principality Stadium is one of the most iconic sporting venues in the world and our retractable roof, one of our most distinctive features, enables us to create an amazing atmosphere with the the match day experience set to come alive during the 2025 Six Nations.""

Storm Éowyn swept across parts of the UK, bringing 96mph (154 km/h) gusts of winds to places like Brizlee Wood in Northumberland. No trains ran in Cumbria all day, and rail services between England and Scotland were also called off on Friday morning, Network Rail said. Meanwhile, more than 60,000 homes in the North East and 16,000 properties in Cumbria were affected by power cuts, with some warned electricity may not be restored until Sunday. An amber weather warning was in place for wind until 21:00 GMT on Friday, with a yellow wind warning continuing in the region until 23:59 GMT. More than 26,000 homes across the North East were without power as of 18:30 GMT, Northern Powergrid said. In Cumbria, Electricity North West said it could take until Sunday evening to restore services. Flights at Newcastle Airport and Teesside Airport were also disrupted, as were ferry services across the River Tyne. Train services are expected to remain disrupted on Saturday, with ""do not travel"" warnings in place in Cumbria. Hundreds of schools were closed across Cumbria and Northumberland for safety reasons, along with dozens across the rest of the region. A section of the A19 northbound was closed earlier from Seaham Grange roundabout to Herrington Interchange in Sunderland due to an overturned lorry. Northumbria Police said no-one was believed to have been seriously injured and the vehicle had been moved. Two out of three lanes of the M6 were shut in both directions between junctions 43 and 44 after a collision involving an HGV. An overturned lorry also led to the partial closure of Redheugh Bridge across the River Tyne. Both southbound lanes were shut along with one northbound and pedestrians were unable to cross. The A1 was closed northbound between Clifton and Tranwell in Morpeth, Northumberland, due to a fallen tree. Carlisle's Sands Centre closed after high winds caused damage to the temporary canopy installed while the auditorium roof is replaced. The venue will remain closed on Saturday but some roads around it will reopen, the council added. Some court cases were either postponed or delayed at Carlisle's magistrates' and crown courts due to Scotland-based defendants being unable to safely travel. School children were also escorted across Eden Bridge after classes, to ensure they were safe. Carlisle Cathedral has cancelled its public services on Saturday following storm damage. Sellafield workers were told to work from home if they could.  The firm said: ""As a precautionary measure, all outside working on the site is restricted... unless in the interests of maintaining nuclear safety or security and subject to risk assessments.""

The tech giant had been facing mounting pressure to withdraw the service, which sent notifications that appeared to come from within news organisations' apps.  ""We are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update,"" an Apple spokesperson said.  Journalism body Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said it showed the dangers of rushing out new features. ""Innovation must never come at the expense of the right of citizens to receive reliable information,"" it said in a statement. ""This feature should not be rolled out again until there is zero risk it will publish inaccurate headlines,"" RSF's Vincent Berthier added. The BBC was among the groups to complain about the feature, after an alert generated by Apple's AI falsely told some readers that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself. The feature had also inaccurately summarised headlines from Sky News, the New York Times and the Washington Post, according to reports from journalists and others on social media.  ""There is a huge imperative [for tech firms] to be the first one to release new features,"" said Jonathan Bright, head of AI for public services at the Alan Turing Institute. Hallucinations - where an AI model makes things up - are a ""real concern,"" he added, ""and as yet firms don't have a way of systematically guaranteeing that AI models will never hallucinate, apart from human oversight. ""As well as misinforming the public, such hallucinations have the potential to further damage trust in the news media,"" he said.  Media outlets and press groups had pushed the company to pull back, warning that the feature was not ready and that AI-generated errors were adding to issues of misinformation and falling trust in news. The BBC complained to Apple in December but it did not respond until January when it promised a software update that would clarify the role of AI in creating the summaries, which were optional and only available to readers with the latest iPhones.  That prompted a further wave of criticism that the tech giant was not going far enough. Apple has now decided to disable the feature entirely for news and entertainment apps. ""With the latest beta software releases of iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and macOS Sequoia 15.3, Notification summaries for the News & Entertainment category will be temporarily unavailable,"" an Apple spokesperson said. The company said that for other apps the AI-generated summaries of app alerts will appear using italicised text. ""We're pleased that Apple has listened to our concerns and is pausing the summarisation feature for news,"" a BBC spokesperson said.  ""We look forward to working with them constructively on next steps. Our priority is the accuracy of the news we deliver to audiences which is essential to building and maintaining trust."" Apple is generally robust about its products and doesn't often even respond to criticism. This simple statement from the tech giant speaks volumes about just how damaging the errors made by its much-hyped new AI feature actually are. Not only was it inadvertently spreading misinformation by generating inaccurate summaries of news stories, it was also harming the reputation of news organisations like the BBC whose lifeblood is their trustworthiness, by displaying the false headlines next to their logos. Not a great look for a newly-launched service. AI developers have always said that the tech has a tendency to ""hallucinate"" (make things up) and AI chatbots all carry disclaimers saying the information they provide should be double-checked. But increasingly AI-generated content is given prominence - including providing summaries at the top of search engines - and that in itself implies that it is reliable.  Even Apple, with all the financial and expert firepower it has to throw at developing the tech, has now proved very publicly that this is not yet the case. It's also interesting that the latest error, which preceded Apple's change of plan, was an AI summary of content from the Washington Post, as reported by their technology columnist Geoffrey A Fowler.  The news outlet is owned by someone Apple boss Tim Cook knows well - Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon."

The truck company will also be banned from exporting its diesel engines to the country for five years. It comes after Hino was charged with fraud in a Detroit court for selling 105,000 illegal engines in the US between 2010 and 2022.  The settlement still requires approval by a US court. According to the US Justice Department, Hino submitted ""false and fraudulent"" emission testing and fuel consumption data in a ""criminal conspiracy"" that allowed it to import and sell its engines in the United States. ""Hino Motors engaged in a years-long scheme to alter and fabricate emissions data in order to get a leg up over its competitors and boost their bottom-line,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. ""To further this fraudulent scheme, Hino violated laws and regulations intended to protect American's health and the environment."" On top of the five-year diesel engine import ban, Hino has also committed to a compliance and ethics plan during that period. ""We take this resolution seriously and will ensure that the field fix, the Environmental Mitigation Program, and further strengthening of our compliance system ... are implemented,"" said Satoshi Ogiso, Hino's chief executive and president in a statement. ""We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and stakeholders."" The US Environmental Protection Agency said Hino has also agreed to recall some infringing heavy-duty trucks and to replace marine and locomotive engines across the country to offset excess air emissions. In order to cover costs resulting from its legal problems, Hino said that in its second quarter financial results announced in October, it reported an extraordinary loss of 230 billion yen (£1.2bn, $1.48bn). In the last decade, several car makers admitted to lying about the emissions produced by their diesel engines. In what has become known as the dieselgate scandal, brands throughout the Volkswagen corporate empire were implicated, including Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda as well as Volkswagen itself. Volkswagen has spent more than 30 billion euros (£25bn, $30.9bn) paying fines, issuing recalls and compensating its customers."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cpw2wp52rjdo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Olly Cracknell is a bird-watching flanker with international ambitions who found relief from the grief of his father's death last year in a roaring opening-day performance for Leicester Tigers. It was only four days before Leicester were to start their campaign, against Exeter Chiefs, that Cracknell's dad Tom passed away after a long illness at the age of 80. There was huge anticipation for the fixtures, as head coach Michael Cheika was in charge of Tigers for the first time.  But after the win, the Australian heaped praise on the back-row forward for his performance and desire to play during such an emotional time. The 30-year-old says it was family that encouraged him to appear for Leicester that day, and he remains thankful to them, as well as friends and all at the club who helped get him on the pitch. ""Before the game it was really hard and I knew if I could just get on the field then you sort of switch off a bit and focus on the game,"" Cracknell told BBC Radio Leicester. ""I knew holding it all back and getting on the field, there was an element of some catharsis in playing and taking it out in the game. ""To win that game the way we did is an experience I'll never forget - a last-minute try away at Exeter. It was nice to be with the boys in that moment."" While putting in big hits and getting stuck in at set-pieces helped Cracknell cope that day, he is someone that tends to find calming comforts in more far flung places. With binoculars in hand, he has escaped to the Isle of Skye off the north west coast of Scotland to watch birds of prey. ""I've gone up to Scotland for a couple of family holidays and we saw eagles up there on one of those and I thought they were really interesting and I wanted to see one in the wild,"" Cracknell said. ""So a year ago, when we had a random week off in January or February, I got a camper van and went with my dog up to the Isle of Skye and saw a golden eagle and white-tailed eagles in the wild. ""I really like the peace of it, and it's a beautiful part of the UK. ""We have a group of lads, the eagle group we call it, and we did a social last year which was good fun. And I'll try to line it up this year as well."" Talking about Cracknell before Leicester's European Champions Cup against Ulster on Saturday, Cheika spoke of a ""stoic"" figure on the pitch and ""different cat"" off it. Cracknell says stoicism is a trait he inherited from his parents, while the notion of being a ""different cat"" - Australian slang for curious character - is no surprise. ""The fact I like birds of prey for a start, is a sign,"" Cracknell laughed. ""Why am I weird? It's hard to answer. I don't know. The eagles, and I studied history and maybe I have slightly different interests from the other boys."" Bird-watching and rugged Scottish getaways are maybe not what is expected of a former Ospreys and London Irish back row who has come into career-best form as he turned 30. He has impressed so thoroughly at number eight for Cheika's Tigers this season that the player better known as a reliable utility back row has been tipped to get an international call-up for the upcoming Six Nations. The Leeds-born player has featured for Wales' Under-20 side and was called up to their senior team in 2017, but remains uncapped at that level - which also leaves him eligible to play for England. Cracknell said there has been no contact over a potential Wales call-up for the Six Nations, but said he is working hard to earn it. ""Every player that goes out there in the Premiership aspires to play international rugby,"" he said. ""I want to test myself at the highest level I can, but I've got to be patient and play as well as I can. ""I just have to keep pushing to improve my game and level up really."""

What is lesser known is that migrants from some of the same countries have a legal route to work on American farms for a limited time. Farm labourer Sandra Noemi Bucu Saz is happy. She's recently returned to Guatemala in Central America from the US, where she was picking strawberries in California. ""They paid us $19 (£15.60) an hour,"" says Sandra. ""We were asked to pick seven boxes per hour, and if we picked more, then we got paid a bit extra. ""It's so different to what I get paid in Guatemala, which is around $10 per day, when there's work."" Sandra is one of around 5,000 Guatemalans who go and work – legally - in the US every year, thanks to a US government visa scheme for temporary agriculture workers from overseas, called H-2A. This allows US farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas. The foreign workers can stay for up to 12 months, before they then have to go back to their home countries. For people like Sandra it's a chance to get on in life, and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns. In Guatemala there are now around 30 recruitment companies that are registered with the Guatemalan government to help people find temporary work in the US via H-2A visas. It's a cold, grey, windy day in southern Guatemala as Sanda proudly shows off the plot of land she rents in a place called Las Tres Cruces, high up in the hills near a town where she lives with her family, called Santiago Sacatepéquez. She and her relatives grow corn, lettuce, beans and spinach for them to eat. And if there's enough left over they sell them at the local market.  Sandra's dream is to save enough money to buy some land, so they don't have to rent. But first she needs to pay off the rest of the debt that she got herself in to after being scammed when she and her sister first tried to get a visa for the United States. ""We paid someone $2,000 per person because we wanted to get work in the US,"" she says. ""My sister and I thought we needed to do this so we could move forward and make our dreams come true. So, we got a loan to get the money, but sadly it was all a scam, and they took our money."" This is common practice for fraudsters in Guatemala, who play with people's desperation to get to the US, and trick them into handing over money. Cesia Ochoa is the executive director for the Guatemala branch of a legitimate recruitment company called Cierto. A business that also has offices in the US and Mexico, it is one of the 30 or so officially registered in Guatemala to offer H-2A visas. ""Part of our inspiration for opening an office in Guatemala was to help locals avoid the scams,"" she says. When Sandra went to the US via Cierto, she didn't have to pay it a fee. Instead, the company is paid by farm businesses in the US looking for temporary workers. Ms Ochoa explains: ""For us, it's really important that we make a good contact between businesses and the workers, and that the salaries and contract they are offering are real."" While the H-2A visa allows people from Guatemala to legally find temporary farm work in the US, there is estimated to be more than 675,000 undocumented Guatemalans in the US, according to the Pew Research Center think tank. And a further 200,000 were found to have tried to enter the US without valid documentation in the 12 months to September of last year. That is the third highest number behind Mexicans and Venezuelans. Olga Romero lives near a town called Olopa in the north-east of Guatemala. She has seven children, two of whom are working in the US without any visas. ""This is a poor region where work is hard to find, and families often pay someone called a coyote between $2,000 and $3,000 to take them to the US illegally,"" says Olga. A big problem is that to raise that amount of money many families need to take out loans secured against the value of their home. They can then lose their properties if the money isn't paid back. And that is often the case, given that the chance of them making it to the US is far from guaranteed, with the risk of accidents along the way, or being turned back at the US border. But the rewards are high. The money loved ones send back from the US is known as remittances, and these are propping up Guatemala's economy. In 2023 the country received $19.8bn in total remittances from abroad, according to one study from the Inter-American Development Bank. President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough on undocumented immigrants, and is threatening to carry out mass deportations . But it is not yet clear if he will make moves to limit, or even stop, H-2A and the other visa schemes for temporary foreign workers. Vanessa García, executive director of recruitment organisation Juan Francisco Garcia Comparini Foundation, is optimistic that such visas will continue. The foundation helps send around 200 Guatemalans a year to work in the US with H-2A visas. These are farm labourers who help to harvest lettuces, cauliflowers, spinach and beans. ""I think that the opportunities for Guatemalans to get an H-2A visa will continue and perhaps even grow,"" she says. ""I am not worried, and I think this is a great opportunity for workers."" Joe Martinez, the US-based founder and CEO of Cierto, says that while he expects the visa scheme to continue under Trump, rights for the foreign workers might be weakened. ""Cierto is concerned that the push to streamline and reduce bureaucratic processes could lead to a program with less worker protections and less oversight."" He is worried that wages could fall for the farmworkers, and that their housing conditions on US farms may worsen. Back in Guatemala, Héctor Benjamín Xoc Xar, says he has done two working trips to the US via the H-2A visa. The most recent one saw him working in a greenhouse growing vegetables. He says his inspiration is his family. ""I want them to do better than me academically,"" he says. ""I left school when I was still young to work in the fields. ""Before I got this work it looked like my daughter wasn't going to be able to finish her final year studying accountancy because we couldn't afford it, but now I've managed to pay for her and she's working as an accountant."""

The global institution upgraded its prediction for UK growth to 1.6% for this year from its previous estimate of 1.5%. But it said a threatened wave of tariffs by incoming US president Trump could make trade tensions worse, lower investment, and disrupt supply chains across the world. The IMF also said although tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation could boost the US economy in the short term, they could ultimately backfire. The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.  Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue - and has threatened to issue tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico on day one of his presidency next week. He has also said he would impose 100% tariffs on the BRICS bloc of nine nations if they were to create a rival currency to the US dollar. The IMF said such policies could set the scene for an inflationary boom followed by a bust and could weaken US Treasury bonds as a safe bet. As well as upgrading its outlook for the UK, the IMF suggested the UK economy would perform better than European economies such as Germany, France and Italy over the next two years. The improved forecast could be a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has faced pressure over her policy decisions this week, after figures showed the economy had flatlined. Labour has made growth its key objective, but Reeves has admitted the government has to ""do more to grow our economy"", in order to boost living standards. The latest IMF figures suggested the UK economy had weaker growth last year than the organisation had expected. Responding to the IMF's report, Reeves highlighted that the UK was the only G7 economy, apart from the US, to have its growth forecast upgraded for 2025. Forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth - from geopolitics to the weather. But such reports can point in the right direction, especially where they align with other predictions. The IMF predicted ""stable, albeit lacklustre"" global growth of 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026, below a historical average of 3.7%. Its 2025 forecast was largely unchanged from a previous one, mainly because it expects higher US growth than previously predicted to offset lower growth in other major economies. The imminent arrival of Trump in the White House dominates the section on risks in the IMF's twice-yearly forecast for the world economy. When he was last in power, Trump launched into a trade war with China, and US policy led to tit-for-tat tariffs with the EU. This time round, Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on global imports, a 25% duty on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods. It warns that an inflationary US boom could be followed by a possible bust that would potentially ""weaken the role of US Treasuries as the global safe asset"". Investors see US Treasury securities as one of the safest possible bets, because the bonds - which are kind of like an IOU -  are backed by the US government. In addition, if red tape on business is cut too much, this could lead to a runaway dollar that could suck money out of emerging economies, depressing global growth. Trump going ahead with deportations of illegal immigrants could ""permanently reduce potential output"" and also raise inflation, The IMF said. Its chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said ""tremendous uncertainty"" about Trump's future policies was already affecting stock markets around the world. On Thursday, the World Bank also warned that US tariffs could hit trade and depress global growth this year."

The talented drummer and vocalist passed away in London on Tuesday.  He was ""an important voice in music and culture, and he will be missed, but never forgotten,"" the statement read.  Osei rose to acclaim as the leader of Osibisa, where his boundless creativity as a multi-instrumentalist never conformed to a single genre.  He played an instrumental role in shaping the unique sound of the band, which captivated the world with its warm, infectious songs that transcended cultural and musical boundaries. The Musicians Union of Ghana (Musiga) shared a heartfelt tribute.  ""Teddy Osei was not only a pioneer in the world of music but also a cultural ambassador who helped bridge the gap between African rhythms and global sounds,"" said Musiga President Bessa Simons.  Born on 1 December, 1937, in Kumasi, Ghana, Teddy Osei was introduced to music by his father, who played in prominent school bands.  A gifted multi-instrumentalist, Osei was best known for his passion for the saxophone, a love he cultivated while studying in the western town of Sekondi. Osei moved to London in the early 1960s on a government scholarship to study music and drama. During this time, Osei formed a band called Cat's Paw, which blended the vibrant rhythms of highlife - a popular West African genre - with the energetic styles of rock and soul. In 1969, Osei co-founded the pioneering Afro-Rock group Osibisa alongside fellow Ghanaian musicians Sol Amarfio and Mac Tontoh.  The band's name, Osibisa, comes from a word in the Fante language, meaning ""highlife"". Osibisa's fusion of Afrocentric sounds with rock, soul, jazz, and funk put them on the global music map as one of the first African bands to gain international recognition. Osei's contribution to the success of Osibisa is undeniable.  His crucial input towards the group led to chart successes in the UK with singles like Sunshine Day and Dance the Body Music.  Their live performances left audiences in awe the world over, leading to extensive tours across Europe, Asia, and Africa.  One of their key performances was at Zimbabwe's independence celebrations in 1980, where Bob Marley and the Wailers also performed. Osei's dedication to promoting African music on the global stage has left an indelible mark on the international music industry. In 2021, he told The Guardian he ventured into music because he ""wanted to make a difference to the African music scene."" Without Osibisa, Osei said, there would have been no Fela Kuti, widely regarded as the godfather of Afrobeat. His contributions served as a cultural bridge that connected diverse audiences through the universal language of music.  ""Osibisa gave Africans confidence in their own music,"" Osei once said, reflecting on what he considered his greatest achievement. His passing marks the end of an era, but his musical innovations and the pathways he forged for African artists will endure, continuing to inspire and resonate with future generations.

Ms Williams and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore were due to return to Earth after a week-long mission in June 2024 but their return has been delayed because of a technical issue.  They now won't be back until late March or possibly April. Ms Williams - an experienced astronaut who has conducted many spacewalks during previous stays aboard the ISS - teamed up with astronaut Nick Hague on Thursday to perform maintenance on the craft.  Their tasks included repairing equipment that governs station orientation, patch light filters on the NICER X-ray telescope, and replacing a reflector device on an international docking adapter. Additionally, the pair will check access areas and connector tools that will be used for future maintenance work on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a particle physics experiment module mounted on the ISS. Nasa said the six-hour-long spacewalk, the eighth in Ms Williams' career, went well and that they completed the jobs they needed to do. You can watch a recording of it here. Ms Williams will conduct a second spacewalk on 23 January with Mr Wilmore. Together, they will remove a radio frequency group antenna assembly (a collection of components designed to transmit and receive radio waves) and collect surface samples for microorganism analysis. They will also prepare a backup elbow joint for the Canadarm2 robotic arm by positioning the joint in the optimal configuration for a quick replacement if needed. Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore went on what was meant to be an eight day mission to the ISS aboard Boeing's Starliner in June 2024. However, technical issues including helium leaks and thruster malfunctions meant that the Starliner was unsafe for their return. Nasa plans to bring them back to Earth in late March aboard a spaceship built by SpaceX, a rival company of Boeing. Despite these setbacks, the astronauts have continued their work aboard the ISS while awaiting a safe journey home."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q7zqy1xlpo","How AI can spot diseases that doctors aren't looking for",2025-01-17,"Zoe Corbyn","Technology Reporter","This is the sixth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments. When 58-year-old Will Studholme ended up in accident and emergency at an NHS hospital in Oxford in 2023 with gastrointestinal symptoms, he wasn't expecting a diagnosis of osteoporosis. The disease, strongly associated with age, causes bones to become weak and fragile, increasing the risk of fracture. It turned out that Mr Studholme had a severe case of food poisoning, but early in his ailment's investigation, he received an abdominal CT scan. That scan was then later run through artificial intelligence (AI) technology which identified a collapsed vertebra in Mr Studholme's spine, a common early indicator of osteoporosis. Further testing ensued, and Mr Studholme emerged not only with his diagnosis, but a simple treatment: an annual infusion of an osteoporosis drug that is expected to improve his bone density.  ""I feel very lucky,"" says Mr Studholme, ""I don't think this would have been picked up without the AI technology."" It isn't unheard of that a radiologist might note something incidental in a patient's imaging – an undetected tumour, a concern with a particular tissue or organ – outside of what they had originally been checking for. But applying AI in the background to systematically comb through scans and automatically identify early signs of common preventable chronic diseases that might be brewing – regardless of the reason the scan was originally ordered – is new. The clinical use of AI for opportunistic screening or opportunistic imaging, as it is called, ""is just beginning"" notes Perry Pickhardt, a professor of radiology and medical physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is among those developing the algorithms. It is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose – be it suspected cancer, chest infection, appendicitis or belly pain. It has the potential to catch previously undiagnosed diseases in the early stages, before onset of symptoms, when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing. ""We can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously,"" says Prof Pickhardt. Regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases, he adds. There's a lot of data in CT scans related to body tissues and organs that we don't really use, notes Miriam Bredella, a radiologist at NYU Langone who is also developing algorithms in the field. And while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements – it would be time consuming. There are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias, she notes. A disease like osteoporosis, for example, is thought of as mostly affecting thin, elderly white women – so doctors don't always think to look outside of that population. Opportunistic imaging, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate that way. Mr Studholme's case is a good example. Being relatively young for osteoporosis, male and with no history of broken bones, it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI. In addition to osteoporosis, AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease, fatty liver disease, age-related muscle loss and diabetes. While the main focus is on CT scans, for example of the abdomen or chest, work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too, including chest x-rays and mammograms. The algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans, and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people, stress the experts. And there is supposed to be a level of human review – if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors. The AI technology used to examine Mr Studholme's scan belongs to Israeli company Nanox.AI, which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening - far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for. Nanox.AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis, heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine CT scans. Oxford NHS hospitals began trialling Nanox.AI's osteoporosis focused product in 2018 before officially rolling it out in 2020. Results from Oxford hospitals show an up to six-fold increase above the NHS average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures – patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis, and start treatment to combat the disease, says Kassim Javaid, a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the University of Oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm's introduction. Further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge, Cardiff, Nottingham, Southampton and Bradford. ""We want to build the evidence to use it across the NHS,"" says Prof Javaid. Yet while the technology can benefit individuals, there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says Sebastien Ourselin, a professor of healthcare engineering at Kings College London, who heads the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare. A big problem that needs to be balanced, he notes, is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create. ""This is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it,"" he says. First, people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing, which takes resources. And, if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive, that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing. Then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed. The extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits Prof Javaid – but there are solutions. Patients confirmed to have the fractures in Oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors. ""The AI does force you to change your pathway,"" he says. And in the long run, believes Prof Javaid, to have a greater number of people with early-stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the NHS money. ""Fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital,"" he says. Mr Studholme has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand: it led to his mother breaking both her hips. It used to just be considered an old person's condition with nothing that could be done, he says. ""I feel quite privileged I can do something before my bones turn into chalk,"" he says."
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cgq003y4qv3o",NA,NA,NA,NA,"When Ash Gardner's maiden one-day international century, which was described as ""one of the best Ashes innings"", is not even her most memorable achievement of the day, you know you have witnessed something spectacular.  The all-rounder rescued Australia from 59-4 with a flawless run-a-ball 102, which helped them post 308-8 and consequently set up a thumping 86-run win to ensure that England remain winless on the tour so far.  At the third time of asking in this ODI series, Australia put together a complete performance to edge closer to retaining the Women's Ashes at the earliest possible opportunity.  Australia now hold a 6-0 lead in the points-based multi-format series and England must win all three T20s (worth two points each) and the Test match (worth four points) in order to regain the Ashes, as a drawn series would see them retained by the holders. Gardner was supported by 50 from a patient Beth Mooney, Tahlia McGrath bludgeoned 55 from 45 balls and then Georgia Wareham's 12-ball 38 took the game away from England, who had absolutely no answers to the world champions.  ""It was a really special innings,"" said former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent on TNT Sports.  ""Ash Gardner is leading the way in the women's global game. I would argue that's one of the best Ashes innings I've seen.  ""It stands out for me because it was a slow surface and Australia were struggling at 59-4. You would think that most teams would scratch around to make 160, 180 or whatever is possible.""  Gardner is known for her explosive capabilities with the bat, and is one of the most powerful strikers of a ball in the women's game, but in Hobart she demonstrated her versatility in leading the recovery from losing four early wickets in a partnership of 95 with Mooney which relied more on strike rotation and skill, than brute strength and risk-taking.  That then allowed the lower order to accelerate past 300 at the end of the innings, pinned England firmly to the ropes, and yet the best was still to come.  The match may have been slipping away from England, a 3-0 ODI series sweep in Australia's sights.  But a team of such extraordinary greatness refuse to take their foot off the gas and in the 41st over, with the ball seemingly sailing for six from the middle of Sophie Ecclestone's bat, Gardner primed herself for even more magic.  She could have been forgiven for being emotionally and physically drained from the century, but instead she plucked the ball from the air with one hand, let it go as her momentum took her over the rope, and managed to stay on her feet to retrieve it just inches off the ground.  The Ricky Ponting stand behind her went silent in suspense at her scarcely believable display of athleticism, before erupting with delight when the replay was shown on the big screen.  BBC Test Match Special's Henry Moeran described it as ""a moment of Women's Ashes history,"" former England spinner Alex Hartley said it was ""the best catch ever in the women's game"" while Rainford-Brent went a step further in her glowing assessment.  ""That was the catch of the century,"" she said. ""That will be shown for many years to come and just shows the difference with Australia and their fielding.""  Spare a thought for 21-year-old Phoebe Litchfield, who had taken a screamer of her own just a few overs earlier, but her back-tracking, full-stretch dive to dismiss Danni Wyatt-Hodge was almost completely overshadowed.  It was a dominant performance from Australia, who were absolutely ruthless in showing England why they should have punished them when they had the chance in the second ODI. England did show some more fight but, somehow, they have got to find another gear to win all of the remaining matches if they are to regain the Ashes for the first time in more than a decade. The series moves on to Sydney with the first of three T20s starting on Monday, but until then, Hobart will be remembered for Gardner and her grand day out."

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit alleges that the multi-billionaire Tesla boss saved $150m (£123m) in share purchases as a result. According to SEC rules, investors whose holdings surpass 5% have 10 days to report that they have crossed that threshold. Musk did so 21 days after the purchase, the filing says. In a social media post, Musk called the SEC a ""totally broken organisation."" He also accused the regulator of wasting its time when ""there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished."" ""Musk's violation resulted in substantial economic harm to investors,"" the SEC complaint said.  In a statement emailed to BBC News, Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, described the lawsuit as a ""sham"" and ""a campaign of harassment"" against his client. Twitter's share price rose by more than 27% after Musk made his share purchase public on 4 April 2022, the SEC said. Musk ended up buying Twitter for $44bn in October 2022 and has since changed the platform's name to X. The complaint was submitted by the SEC to a federal court in Washington DC on Tuesday. The lawsuit also asked the court to order Musk to give up ""unjust"" profits and pay a fine. The head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, announced in November that he will resign from his role when Donald Trump returns to the White House on 20 January. That was after Trump said he planned to sack Mr Gensler on ""day one"" of his new administration. Under Mr Gensler's leadership, the SEC clashed with Musk, who is a close ally of the president-elect. But Musk had run-ins with the SEC long before Mr Gensler took office. In 2018, the regulator charged Musk with defrauding investors by claiming he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla, the electric car company he leads, private. He later settled the charges, stepping down as chairman of the firm's board and agreeing to accept what was dubbed a Twitter sitter - limits on what he could write on social media about the company."

The changes, which are set to come into force from 27 January, are a U-turn from a policy introduced six years ago that allowed people to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase. The move is part of the ""back to Starbucks"" strategy - a plan announced by the firm's new boss as he tries to tackle flagging sales. Starbucks said there was no change to its policy in the UK, where customers can continue to use the facilities without purchasing anything. The world's biggest coffee chain says its new code of conduct - which also addresses harassment and bans smoking and outside alcohol - aims to make its stores more welcoming. ""Implementing a Coffeehouse Code of Conduct... is a practical step that helps us prioritise our paying customers who want to sit and enjoy our cafes,"" a Starbucks spokesperson told BBC News. ""These updates are part of a broader set of changes we are making to enhance the cafe experience as we work to get back to Starbucks."" The company said the new rules would be displayed at every store and staff would be instructed to ask anyone who violates the code of conduct to leave. That includes allowing employees to call the police when necessary. The change ends a policy Starbucks introduced in 2018 after two black men were arrested at one of the company's stores in Philadelphia.  The men, one of whom had asked to use the toilet, had said they were waiting for a friend and refused a manager's request to leave.  The video of the incident went viral, and critics accused the chain of racial profiling and called for a boycott.  Starbucks apologised to the men, agreed a settlement, and to help counter the backlash announced it would welcome people into their cafes, whether or not they were customers. Starbucks has been trying to boost flagging sales as it grappled with a backlash to price increases and boycotts sparked by the Israel-Gaza war. Brian Niccol, who previously headed the Mexican food chain Chipotle, was brought into Starbucks last year to help turn the business around. Mr Niccol has been trying to improve the customer experience at Starbucks' cafes by revamping its menus and coffee shops. Other changes set to be introduced later this month include offering one free refill of hot or iced coffee for customers who buy a drink to consume on the premises."

Adam Hasting, 28, was spotted on 20 February last year using his phone by officers on Gloucestershire's A40 Golden Valley bypass. Hastings, of Shurdington Road, Cheltenham, did not attend the hearing at Gloucestershire Magistrates' Court on Monday, but his lawyer pleaded guilty to both offences on Hastings' behalf. Anton Balkitis, representing the rugby player, said: ""He is very contrite and deeply apologetic about his driving."" Hastings, who has been capped 32 times by Scotland, is currently in his second spell with Glasgow Warriors, having previously played for Bath and Gloucester.  He already had six points on his licence after being caught speeding on two previous occasions in 2022 and 2023. The court also heard the former Gloucester Rugby player had been caught speeding at 37mph in a 30mph zone in the North Kensington area of London on 8 June last year. Scott Davies, prosecuting, told the court: ""Officers in a marked patrol vehicle saw a grey Kia Sportage driving along the A40 northern bypass. ""As the car approached the Elmbridge Court roundabout, the vehicle was seen to weave left and right before moving across to the left lane. ""Police observed the driver holding the mobile phone and his mouth was seen to move up and down as if engaging in a conversation,"" he added.

A bittern, also known as a 'ghost bird' and Britain's loudest bird, was captured on a trail camera at the Wetland Centre in St Ouen by photographer John Ovenden. National Trust Jersey said the video had received 237,000 views on social media and had been seen by people across Europe, north America and the Middle East. Bitterns were ""driven to extinction"" in the 19th century due to drained wetland habitats, but in April 2024 the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said their numbers had increased by 24% - marking ""significant conservation progress"". The Trust said a male bittern's ""boom"" could be heard up to three miles (4.8km) away in spring. ""The Wetland centre is probably one of the best places to observe the bittern in the UK and whilst we currently only have two males that appear each year, the Trust is ever hopeful that with the growth in numbers in the UK that we will hear the boom locally as our male bitterns look for and find a mate,"" it said.

""No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,"" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. ""Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects. ""There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic."" It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings. Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%. By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%. Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies. ""Danes are actually happy at work,"" he tells the BBC. ""Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent."" Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark. These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid annual leave per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days. Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave. In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave. Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule. The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. ""If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,"" says Mr Wiking. He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace. Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely ""not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time"". Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. ""The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids."" Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance. ""If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,"" he says. ""But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know."" Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. ""You don't need to ask me to leave early,"" he says. ""No one takes advantage of my kindness."" Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant. ""If you lose your job, the government is there to help,"" adds Mr Rouchmann. As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. ""Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US."" Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country ""prioritises collective well-being"". By contrast, she says the US ""has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance"". Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations. ""Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,"" she says. ""These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being. ""More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth."""

He played in each of English football's top six divisions, scoring 190 times in more than 600 appearances. Morison played ""alright"" but was ""a bit Bambi on ice"" in the first half, Gurney said. He said ""it kind of just started off as a joke"" when he asked about Morison's availability at The Old Crown in Ashton. Morison said: ""The guys down the pub are great and it was nice to help Jay out."" However, he said there was ""a lot to discuss in the pub this week"" about the manager's decision making, after he substituted Morison with 15 minutes to go with Hartwell leading 3-1. One of Morison's goals was a penalty kick and he said he ""felt more pressure taking that penalty because I knew every single person there wanted me to miss"". He said: ""Luckily I scored because I don't think I would have been able to live that one down.""

But it is one of the slowest rates of growth in decades as the world's second largest economy struggles to shake off a protracted property crisis, high local government debt and youth unemployment. The head of the country's statistics bureau said China's economic achievements in 2024 were ""hard won,"" after the government launched a slew of stimulus measures late last year. Beijing has rarely missed its growth targets in the past.  Experts had broadly predicted this rate of growth. The World Bank said lower borrowing costs and rising exports would mean China could achieve annual growth of 4.9%. Investors, however, are bracing themselves: the threat of President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs on $500bn (£409bn) worth of Chinese goods looms large. Yet that is not all that stands in the way of China achieving its growth targets next year. Business and consumer confidence is low, and the Chinese yuan will continue to weaken as Beijing cuts interest rates in a bid to boost growth. Here are three reasons why Xi has bigger challenges than Trump's tariffs: There is a growing chorus of warnings that China's economy will slow in 2025. One major driving factor of last year's growth is now at risk: exports. China has relied on manufacturing to help exit the slowdown - so, it has been exporting a record number of electric vehicles, 3D printers and industrial robots. The US, Canada and the European Union have accused China of making too many goods and imposed tariffs on Chinese imports to protect domestic jobs and businesses. Experts say Chinese exporters may now focus on other parts of the world. But those countries are likely to be in emerging markets, which don't have the same levels of demand as North America and Europe. That could impact Chinese businesses that are hoping to expand, in turn hitting suppliers of energy and raw materials. Xi wants to transform China from the world's factory for cheap goods into a high-tech powerhouse by 2035 but it's unclear how manufacturing can continue to be such a big growth driver in the face of rising tariffs. In China, household wealth is largely invested in the property market. Before the real estate crisis, it accounted for almost a third of China's economy - employing millions of people, from builders and developers to cement producers and interior designers. Beijing has implemented a slew of policies to stabilise the property market and the the financial markets watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), has said it will vigorously support reforms. But there are still too many empty homes and commercial properties, and that oversupply continues to force down prices. The property market slump is expected to bottom out this year, but Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs says the downturn will be a ""multi-year drag"" on China's economic growth. It's already hit spending hard - in the last three months of 2024, household consumption contributed just 29% to China's economic activity, down from 59% before the pandemic.  That is one of the reasons Beijing has stepped up exports. It wants to help offset sluggish domestic spending on new cars, luxury items and almost everything else. The government has even introduced programmes like consumer goods trade-ins, where people can exchange their washing machines, microwaves and rice cookers. But experts wonder whether these kinds of measures alone are sufficient without addressing deeper issues in the economy. They say people will need more money in their pockets before pre-Covid levels for spending return. ""China needs to bring back the animal spirit of the population and we are still far from that,"" said Shuang Ding, Chief Economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Bank. ""If the private sector starts to invest and innovate that could increase income and the job outlook, and people will have more confidence to consume."" Steep public debt and unemployment have also affected savings and spending. Official figures suggest the youth jobless rate remains high compared to before the pandemic, and that wage rises have stalled. President Xi has promised to invest in the cutting-edge industries that the government calls ""new productive forces"". Until now, that has helped China become a leader in goods like renewable energy products such as solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. Last year, China also overtook Japan as the world's biggest car exporter. But the lacklustre economic picture, uncertainty over tariffs and other geopolitical uncertainties mean the appetite of foreign businesses for investment in China is subdued. It's not about foreign or domestic investment - it's that businesses don't see a bright future, said Stephanie Leung from wealth management platform StashAway. ""They would like to see a more diversified set of investors coming in."" For all of these reasons, experts believe the measures to support the economy will only partially alleviate the impact of potential new US tariffs. Beijing must either undertake big, bold measures or accept that the economy is not going to grow so fast, Goldman Sachs' Chief China Economist Hui Shan wrote in a recent report, adding: ""We expect them to choose the former."" ""China needs to stabilise property markets and create sufficient jobs to ensure social stability,"" Mr Ding from Standard Chartered Bank said. According to researcher China Dissent Monitor, there were more than 900 protests in China between June and September 2024 led by workers and property owners - 27% more than the same period a year earlier. These sort of social strains as a result of economic grievances and an erosion of wealth will be a concern for the Chinese Communist Party. After all, explosive growth turned China into a global power, and the promise of increased prosperity has largely helped its leaders keep a tight lid on dissent."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78w9zz62ego","TikTok says report of possible sale to Musk 'pure fiction'",2025-01-14,"João da Silva","Business reporter","TikTok has called a report that China is considering allowing a sale of the social media company's US operations to Elon Musk ""pure fiction."" The firm's comments came in response to a report by Bloomberg that Chinese officials are weighing an option that could see its business in America being sold to the world's richest person if the US Supreme Court upholds a ban on the app. Supreme Court justices are due to rule on a law that set a 19 January deadline for TikTok to either sell its US operations or face a ban in the country. TikTok has repeatedly said that it will not sell its US operation. ""We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction,"" a TikTok spokesperson told BBC News. Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that one possible scenario being considered by Chinese officials would see Musk's X social media platform take control of TikTok's US operations. X did not immediately reply to a BBC request for comment. Musk is a close ally of US president-elect Donald Trump, who is set to return to the White House on 20 January. Last month, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay its decision until he takes office to enable him to seek a ""political resolution"". His lawyer filed a legal brief with the court that says Trump ""opposes banning TikTok"" and ""seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office"". That came a week after Trump met TikTok's chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. On Monday, two Democratic lawmakers, Senator Edward Markey and Representative Ro Khanna, also called on Congress and the President Joe Biden to extend the 19 January deadline. During a Supreme Court hearing last week, justices appeared inclined to uphold the legislation and stick to the deadline. During nearly three hours of arguments, the nine justices returned time and again to the national security concerns that gave rise to the law. The Biden administration has argued that without a sale, TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation. The company has repeatedly denied any influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law to ban it in the US violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2eg7ge72j2o","ICJ president Nawaf Salam named Lebanon's new prime minister",2025-01-13,"David Gritten","BBC News","Nawaf Salam, the president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague, has been named as Lebanon's new prime minister. Two thirds of the 128 members of parliament nominated the 71-year-old judge for the post - reserved for a Sunni Muslim under a sectarian power sharing system - during consultations with newly elected President Joseph Aoun. Caretaker PM Najib Mikati got nine votes. The presidency said Salam would return to Lebanon on Tuesday. His appointment is another blow to Hezbollah, which had sought to reappoint Mikati but ended up nominating no candidate. The Iran-backed Shia Muslim militia and political party has been significantly weakened by its recent war with Israel. Senior Hezbollah lawmaker Mohammed Raad accused its opponents of working for fragmentation and exclusion. He complained that his group had ""extended its hand"" by supporting Aoun's election only to find the ""hand cut"", and warned that ""any government at odds with coexistence has no legitimacy whatsoever"". However, Christian and Sunni allies of Hezbollah did back Salam. Gebran Bassil, the leader of Lebanon's biggest Maronite Christian bloc, called him the ""face of reform"". Sunni lawmaker Faisal Karami meanwhile said he had nominated the ICJ chief due to the demands for ""change and renewal"" as well as promises of international support for Lebanon. Salam is a member of a prominent Sunni family from Beirut. His uncle, Salam, helped Lebanon gain independence from France in 1943 and served several terms as prime minister. His cousin, Tammam, was also prime minister from 2014 to 2016. He holds a doctorate in political science from Sciences Po university in France, a doctorate in history from the Sorbonne and a Master of Law degree from Harvard Law School. Salam worked as a lawyer and a lecturer at several universities before serving as Lebanon's permanent representative to the United Nations in New York from 2007 to 2017. He became a member of the ICJ - the UN's top court - in 2018, and was elected president for a three-year term last February. He took over as the ICJ heard a case brought by South Africa that accused Israeli forces of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel dismissed the allegation as baseless. Now that he has been designated prime minister by President Aoun, Salam must agree a cabinet line-up that can win a confidence vote in Lebanon's deeply-divided parliament. Former Lebanese army chief Aoun's candidacy for the presidency - a role reserved for a Maronite Christian - was backed by many key political parties in parliament as well as the United States, France and Saudi Arabia.  Hezbollah and its ally, Amal, voted for him in the second round of last Thursday's presidential election following the withdrawal of their preferred candidate. After the election, Aoun declared that ""a new phase in Lebanon's history"" had begun and vowed to work to ensure that the Lebanese state had ""the exclusive right to bear arms"" - a reference to Hezbollah, which had built a force considered more powerful than the army to resist Israel before their 13-month conflict in violation of a UN Security Council resolution. The army was not involved in the war and has a key role under the ceasefire deal agreed between the Lebanese and Israeli governments at the end of November. It is required to deploy soldiers in southern Lebanon as Israeli troops withdraw and to ensure Hezbollah ends its armed presence there by 26 January. Aoun also promised to help the new government push through the political and economic reforms widely seen as necessary in a country that has been affected by multiple crises. Besides the Hezbollah-Israel conflict, they include a six-year-long economic depression that is one of the worst recorded in modern times, and the 2020 Beirut port explosion that killed more than 200 people."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7x84qvv4o","US tightens control on AI chips export drawing pushback",2025-01-13,"Natalie Sherman","BBC News","The US is moving to impose tough new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology to dozens of countries - not just the handful it has long identified as adversaries. Officials say the new rules are intended to make sure the ""the world's AI runs on American rails"" and keep it out of the hands of ""malicious actors"" who could use it to threaten the United States. The Biden administration said 18 allies and partners, including the UK, were exempt from the restrictions. The announcement, days before President Joe Biden is due to leave office, has  drawn fierce criticism from some top US tech companies who warn it will only aid competitors. ""In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance,"" the US Commerce Department said on Monday. Chip-maker Nvidia - among the companies whose business would be most affected by the plan - said if implemented, it would not ""mitigate any threat"" but only ""weaken America's global competitiveness"" and undermine its innovation. ""By attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition—the lifeblood of innovation—the Biden Administration's new rule threatens to squander America's hard-won technological advantage,"" the company said. The new restrictions face a 120-day comment period before going into effect. Exports to countries such as China, Russia and Iran already face strict controls.  The new rules set caps for exports of certain technology to most countries around the world and require US companies to get authorisation for sales there.  Washington's closest allies would be exempt from the limits. Orders under a certain level of computing power also would not require a license or count toward the caps under the plan. Most orders, such as those from universities or medical organisations, fall under that threshold of 1,700 advanced GPUs, the Biden administration said.  The rules also outline a process for foreign governments to sign agreements, in exchange for looser restrictions.  Biden administration officials said they had discussed the regulations with the incoming administration. But Jonathan Kewley, co-head of the tech group at the Clifford Chance law firm,  said he did not think the rules would survive once Trump enters office, noting that one of Trump's key campaign promises was to change the government's approach to AI regulation.   ""It is absolutely sure that the Trump administration will wind back a lot of what Biden has put out there,"" he said. ""There's going to be a big play for innovation and growth in the US and a drawback from the approach to AI regulation."" The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech policy thinktank, said it thought the US would be better served by a strategy focused on competition, instead of ""containment"". ""By pressuring other nations to choose between the United States and China, the administration risks alienating key partners and inadvertently strengthening China's position in the global AI ecosystem,"" vice president Daniel Castro said.  ""Confronted with such an ultimatum, many countries may opt for the side offering them uninterrupted access to the AI technologies vital for their economic growth and digital futures""."

It comes after a conservative group, the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), called on the technology giant to abolish its DEI policies, saying they expose firms to ""litigation, reputational and financial risks"". Apple's directors say the NCPPR's proposal is unnecessary because the company has appropriate checks and balances in place.  Other major US firms, including Meta and Amazon, have rolled back DEI programmes ahead of the return to the White House this month of Donald Trump, who has been highly critical of DEI policies. ""The proposal is unnecessary as Apple already has a well-established compliance program,"" the firm's filing to investors said. Apple's board also said the DEI rollback plan ""inappropriately seeks to micromanage the Company's programs and policies by suggesting a specific means of legal compliance."" NCPPR's proposal is set to be put to a vote by shareholders at Apple's annual general meeting on 25 February.  Conservative groups have threatened to take legal action against major companies over their DEI programmes, saying such policies are at odds with a Supreme Court decision in 2023 against affirmative action at universities. Last week, Facebook owner Meta became the latest US company to roll back its DEI initiatives, joining a growing list of major firms that includes Amazon, Walmart and McDonald's. In a memo to staff about the decision - which affects, hiring, supplier and training efforts - Meta cited a ""shifting legal and policy landscape"". It also referred to the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling. Meta's boss, Mark Zuckerberg, has been moving to reconcile with Trump since his election in November. The firm has donated $1m (£820,000) to the President-elect's inauguration fund, hired a Republican as his public affairs chief and announced it is getting rid of fact-checkers on Meta's social media platforms.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg52543v6rmo","Norway on track to be first to go all-electric",2025-01-13,"Adrienne Murray","Business reporter","Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it? For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A Møller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars. Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV). ""We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,"" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. ""Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back."" On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an ""E"" for ""electric"" on its licence plate. The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars. Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads. And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.  In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out. By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023. In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%. Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making. ""It started already in the early 1990s,"" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan. ""Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes."" The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained. ""It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,"" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund. Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be ""zero emission"", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach. ""We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,"" adds Kroglund. ""I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars."" Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains. Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars. A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed. By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030. Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them. For many locals, like Ståle Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense. ""With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,"" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital. ""In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,"" Mr Fyen adds. ""You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to."" Another driver, Merete Eggesbø, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. ""I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving."" At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers. This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population. That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report. Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation. Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports. Ms Bu says there's ""not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway"". However, she adds that it is ""all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market"". Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. ""I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible."" Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (£1.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel. The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity. ""A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,"" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. ""I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days."""
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c627j0z4nymo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"When a game of cricket lasts for nearly 93 overs, there are several moments where it is won and lost.  But as England squandered a chance to level the Women's Ashes in the second one-day international in Melbourne, the final two balls of their innings summed up the sucker punch that Australia dealt.  The final half an hour was chaotic in itself, with the usually impeccable Australian fielders dropping four catches of varying difficulty and all-rounder Annabel Sutherland being taken out of the attack for bowling two waist-high no-balls.  It showed that Australia were once again far from perfect as the second of those no-balls came from the final ball of the 48th over, and Tahlia McGrath was tasked with bowling the free hit.  But what followed from Amy Jones, who was on 47, was completely inexplicable as she had miscalculated the over, and turned down the single to protect number 11 Lauren Bell - only she did the exact opposite.  Australia, the world champions and Ashes holders since 2014, were fired up despite their own mistakes and a team of such ruthless quality will always punish such a catastrophic error.  The result? Bell is bowled by Megan Schutt, England are 159 all out, and Australia snatch victory from the jaws of defeat with their characteristically dogged refusal to back down under pressure.  And, frankly, that quality is something England need to learn from.  But, we have seen this one before.  England enjoyed a brilliant home summer against New Zealand and Pakistan where they went unbeaten, but very rarely were they challenged. In the subsequent T20 World Cup in the autumn, they crumbled in their final group-stage match against West Indies and crashed out of the tournament.  Following that disappointment, they responded well by thrashing South Africa away from home in all three formats in November and December, but once the pressure was applied in a must-win situation in the heat of an Ashes cauldron, it was the same old story.  Of course, the defeat is not Jones' or Bell's fault or the fact that England are 4-0 down and facing an enormous uphill climb.  Australia are an incredible side packed with world-class talent and Alana King, Ash Gardner and Kim Garth all produced fantastic spells of disciplined bowling to keep England under the pump all the way through their pursuit of 180.  And the pitch erred on the side of ""bowler-friendly"". But even when taking all of that into consideration, it was a game that England lost as opposed to Australia winning. They may not be afforded a better chance to get themselves back in the contest. Jones battled for 103 balls and should get credit for taking the game as deep as she did when the wickets fell around her, but that does not take away from the fact that, as the senior batter, the mismanagement of the situation when batting with the tail was extremely costly. Even before the free hit misjudgement, twice she turned down singles from the fifth ball of an over and then could not keep the strike from the sixth. Gardner's 46th over was blocked out by Bell, and as a result the run-rate spiralled way above a run-a-ball and Jones was backed into a corner to play her shots with more risk than necessary.  The tempo of the chase was curious throughout, too, particularly from a side whose leader and coach are constantly telling us how they aspire to entertain, to play a positive brand of cricket and put pressure back on the opposition.  England faced 289 balls out of their 300 available, and 206 of them were dot balls.  When considering moments where the game was lost, that is a pretty damning indicator.  Another frustration is the way that England have not addressed their problems against spin.  Gardner was their nemesis in 2023, despite the eventually drawn scoreline, taking 23 wickets across all three formats.  Already in this series, she has taken 3-19 and 1-23, while King tied England in knots with a masterful display of leg-spin, a spell of 4-25 fittingly delivered in front of the Shane Warne stand, no less.  At the start of King's spell, WinViz was 76% in favour of England. By the end, it was 99% in favour of Australia.  With subtle variations of pace and relentless accuracy to get the most out of the gripping surface, King ripped one past Danni Wyatt-Hodge first ball and then had England's star batter Nat Sciver-Brunt caught at cover soon after. King's latter two wickets were gifted to her, but a fair result for the pressure she had built: in the last over of her spell, Charlie Dean perished after a poor ramp shot, caught by Beth Mooney at slip, before Sophie Ecclestone edged behind the very next ball. The dissection of the batting woes unfortunately stole the limelight from England's phenomenal bowling, which was led by Ecclestone and Capsey who took seven wickets between them as Australia were blown away.  After losing six wickets in chasing 203 in the series opener, there appears to be an unusual fragility to Australia's batting line-up which is there to be exploited.  The difference is that Australia have got an edge, a killer instinct to dig their heels in and win matches even with their backs to the wall.  England need to find that within them, and quickly. "

The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK. Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like. But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients. Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference. “Usually when I’m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,” she says. “This now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.” She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her “two to three minutes per consultation, if not more”. She reels off other benefits: “It reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking."" With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.  A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA). Could AI be the solution to help GP’s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout? Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time. Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients. One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking. Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year. “The idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,” says Lars Maaløe, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations. “The AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,” says Mr Maaløe. “I imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It’s giving that colleague advice.” He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. “It could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?” But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations? Mr Maaløe says “the data is not leaving system”. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though. “If the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.” Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. “I haven’t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn’t do it.” Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients’ medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken. “It can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there’s any relevant information from their medical history,” says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP. The AI is trained on published medical research papers. “For example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,” says Dr Bakshi. “It won’t diagnose, but it can facilitate.” She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types. An AI report published by the BMA this year found that “AI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency”. In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: ""We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress. ""Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.” Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI. ""There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,” says Ms Dennis. “AI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use – which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.” She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation. “The NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place."" For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. “It has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.”"
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cdjdedykez3o",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Women's Ashes, first ODI: North Sydney Oval England 204 (43.1 overs): Knight 39 (48); Gardner 3-19 Australia 206-6 (38.5 overs): Healy 70 (78); Ecclestone 2-38 Australia won by four wickets; lead the series 2-0 Scorecard Ash Gardner's fine all-round performance proved the difference as England were beaten by four wickets in the first one-day international of the Women's Ashes in Sydney.  Gardner took 3-19 as England were bowled out for 204, and then scored an unbeaten 42 to lead Australia to victory with 11.1 overs to spare.  England showed glimpses of promise, and Australia signs of fragility in losing their six wickets, but Heather Knight's side paid the price for a wasteful batting performance alongside sloppiness in the field which included Sophie Ecclestone dropping Gardner on 31. The visitors fought admirably with the ball, with fine economical efforts from Lauren Bell and Ecclestone, but Australia were rarely under scoreboard pressure after a batting innings that was littered with soft dismissals. England were all out in 43.1 overs as captain Knight top-scored with 39, Danni Wyatt-Hodge made a gritty 38 and Amy Jones 31, but all three failed to capitalise on their promising starts.   Having been asked to bat first, England were building a decent position at 91-2, before Australia struck the hammer blow of removing Knight and star all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt in consecutive Gardner overs, both caught slog-sweeping by Ellyse Perry. Jones looked in fine form in her rebuilding stand of 51 with Wyatt-Hodge, whose knock was an outlier in a tame middle-to-lower order effort with the last five wickets falling for 47 runs.   It was not a faultless bowling performance from the hosts, who conceded 24 extras including a no-ball which gave Maia Bouchier a reprieve when she was bowled in the first over, but England lacked the ruthlessness to punish them.  Similarly in the second innings, Annabel Sutherland's dismissal for 10 in the 24th over offered another opening at 124-4, but Gardner showed the steel and discipline which England's batters lacked. The relentless schedule of the series gives England little time to turn their fortunes around, with the second ODI taking place at the Junction Oval in Melbourne on 13 January (23:05 GMT). The win gives Australia a 2-0 lead on points in the multi-format series, which England need to win outright in order to regain the Ashes.  Australia delivered a decent bowling effort, with Gardner's spell and Kim Garth's economical opening burst the highlights, but the frustration for England was that they softly handed them their wickets. It looked like a nightmare start when Bouchier was bowled first ball by Megan Schutt, only for the seamer to have overstepped, but the blemish did not faze the world champions as the opener was caught behind at the end of the fourth over. Tammy Beaumont was then caught at mid-on for a stuttering 13 from 31 balls, and Knight and Sciver-Brunt's inexplicable lapses in concentration gifted Australia the upper hand just as they were looking settled.  Jones struck four fours and a whopping six in her knock before chipping one back to leg-spinner Alana King, and Alice Capsey's four from 20 balls marked the beginning of a tough day as she later dropped a sitter with Perry on seven.  Wyatt-Hodge countered her usual aggression as the wickets tumbled regularly but while they all looked in good nick, starts are never going to be enough against a side as clinical as Australia.  The innings also served a reminder of Australia's class in the field as they gave nothing away - the pressure that they apply in saving boundaries and their athleticism contributed to much of the frustration that resulted in England's wickets. England were dealt a big blow before the match with experienced seamer Kate Cross ruled out by a back injury, but Bell stepped up admirably in her absence with final figures of 1-25, including the key scalp of Perry for 14, and an opening spell of 1-6 from her first five overs. Her new-ball partner Lauren Filer bowled with lively pace and troubled the Australian top order – she had Phoebe Litchfield caught behind with a beautiful lifting delivery in the second over – but at times lacked the control which England could not afford early on when defending a below-par total. England's fielding and catching woes which haunted them in the autumn's T20 World Cup remain a concern and those mistakes were even more glaring when compared with Australia's brilliance. Capsey's drop of Perry, which was straight to her at deep square leg, was not costly in terms of runs but it contributed to a rather flat feel among the fielders and smaller errors such as overthrows started to creep in more regularly.  Australia only needed a further 22 runs when Gardner was dropped so the result may have been inevitable, but against a team who offer so few chances, they must be taken.   Healy looked in ominous touch with 11 fours in her 78-ball knock which set up the victory, but the regular wickets that fell in the middle order should give England hope that they may not be too far away from victory if they can tighten up their discipline. England captain Heather Knight: ""I was pleased with the performance. We felt like we were in the game, we just needed to grab a few more wickets at the end. It was a bad toss to lose. ""I was pleased with how the bowlers went about it. Lauren Bell was outstanding. It's the best I have seen her bowl. It felt like we were really close - we just need to sharpen up a few things before the next game."" Australia captain Alyssa Healy: ""I'm pretty happy. I think always some areas to work on but to take the two points into the Junction Oval is pleasing. I thought we could have been more clinical with the bat at the end, but having said that it was the kind of wicket where you never felt in so we did well to chase that down."" Ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent on TNT Sports: ""Alice Capsey dropping Ellyse Perry was not that costly in runs but it set the tone. If you have Lauren Filer getting Phoebe Litchfield then Capsey holds that catch a few balls later you think 'hey, we are on top in the game and driving it forward'. ""But instead you lose that momentum. England just have to be sharper because there is no room for weakness, especially over in Australia. There's enough to work with but they'll have to sharpen up."""
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c5ygyv7yvz1o",NA,NA,NA,NA,"England seamer Kate Cross will not feature in the first one-day international of the women's Ashes because of a back injury.  Cross, 33, missed the one-off Test match against South Africa in December after suffering with a back spasm during the third ODI of that tour.  Lauren Filer and Lauren Bell are the frontline seamers selected alongside all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt.  Cross was unable to bowl in the tour's only warm-up match on Thursday, where only 28.2 overs were completed because of rain in Sydney. She revealed on the No Balls podcast with Alex Hartley that she had an epidural to try and get herself fit for the first match but was not able to prove her fitness in time. It is a significant blow for England, as Cross is their most experienced and reliable seamer having played 72 ODIs since her debut in 2013, while Filer and Bell have played 12 and 16 matches respectively. The multi-format Ashes started on Saturday (23:30 GMT) with the first of three ODIs, which are followed by three T20s and one Test match.  It has not been confirmed whether Cross will be fit for the remaining ODIs, which take place on 13 January in Melbourne and 15 January in Hobart.  She is not in England's T20 squad but would be likely to play in the Test if able.  Australia hold the Ashes, so England will need to win the points-based series outright in order to regain the trophy. "

The Court's nine justices heard from lawyers representing TikTok, and content creators that the ban would be a  violation of free speech protections for the platform's more than 170 million users in the US. The US government argued that without a sale, TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.  A decision by the top court has to be made within days. President-elect Donald Trump - who returns to the White House in just over a week - now argues against the ban. The law requires TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell it in the US or cease operations on 19 January. The company has said it will not sell the short-form video platform. Congress passed the law with support from both the Democratic and Republican parties - a moment that marked the culmination of years of concern about the widely popular platform, which is known for its viral videos and traction among young people. The legislation does not forbid use of the app, but would require tech giants such as Apple and Google to stop offering it and inhibit updates, which analysts suggest would kill it over time.  TikTok has repeatedly denied any potential influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users.  Noel Francisco, a former US solicitor general appearing for the platform, stressed the ban on the most popular speech platform for Americans could also open the door to a dangerous form of censorship. He argued that  ""the government cannot restrict speech in order to protect us from speech"".  ""That's precisely what this law does from beginning to end."" A representative for platform creators argued they should be free to use the publisher of their choice. Jeffrey L Fisher, a Stanford University law professor representing creators who sued over the law, told the court on Friday that the country has historically faced ""ideological campaigns by foreign adversaries"". But he said that under the First Amendment, mere ideas do not represent a national security threat. Justice department lawyer Elizabeth B Prelogar told  the court that ByteDance's ties to the Chinese government made it a national security risk. She told the court that Beijing ""could weaponise TikTok at any time to harm the United States"". During nearly three hours of arguments, the nine justices  returned time and again to the national security concerns that gave rise to the law in the first place,  while also probing free speech questions. ""Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?"" conservative Chief Justice John Roberts asked TikTok lawyer Mr Francisco. Justice Brett Kavanaugh drilled into concerns the US government has raised about the data the app collects on its users and how that data might be used. The risks seem like a ""huge concern for the future of the country"", he said. In December, US President-elect Donald Trump urged the court to delay its decision until he returns to the White House to enable him to seek a ""political solution"" to resolve the issues at hand. TikTok's lawyer told the court on Friday that, as he saw it, the platform would ""go dark"" on 19 January without intervention. Ms Prelogar, arguing for the US justice department, said ""nothing permanent"" had to happen on that day and there was still time for a sale.  Forcing the app to go dark could be just the ""jolt"" ByteDance needs to seriously consider a sale, she said. ""It will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance might consider,"" she said, comparing the situation to ""game of chicken"" and one in which the US should not ""blink first"". After the hearing, legal observers predicted that the Supreme Court's justices appeared to be swayed by the government's concerns. ""Traditionally the Supreme Court has been willing to defer somewhat when national security is at stake,"" said University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias. ""I expect that the justices by a majority will side with the government,"" he added.  Jacob Hubert, a lawyer and the president of the Liberty Justice Center - which represents BASED Politics, an internet content creator - said it was still difficult to predict how the court would rule.  But he says  the ban would violate the freedom of speech of millions of Americans - a point he believes was effectively made by TikTok's lawyers.  ""It's not about China's rights, or the Communist Party's rights,"" he said. ""It is about the rights of Americans who use TikTok to, largely, speak with other Americans."" More than a hundred people braved freezing conditions in Washington DC to attend the hearing in person. Chloe Joy Sexton - one of the TikTok creators named in the suit - said that the platform brought many creators ""financial independence"", including many mothers.  ""A TikTok ban would place these women, myself included, in true financial jeopardy,"" she told reporters. ""It would destroy both my business and the community that means so much to me.""  Danielle Ballesteros, a student at UC San Diego, said had been waiting outside the court since 06:30 local time. ""I feel like TikTok doesn't deserve to be banned,"" she told BBC News. While admitting to using it ""probably too much"", she said she believes the app to be an important news source for her generation. TikTok is already banned from government devices in many countries, including in the UK. It faces more complete bans in some countries, including India.   Last December, a three-judge appeals court decision upheld the law, noting China's record of acting through private companies and saying the measure was justified as ""part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed"" by the country.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) subsequently confirmed the ban extended to all domestic cricket competitions outside Bangladesh and in international cricket. The BCB said on Saturday that Shakib failed a reassessment in Chennai, India, last month, but added he is eligible to play as a specialist batter in all forms of cricket. Shakib has previously said he plans to retire from international cricket after the Champions Trophy in March, but Bangladesh must now decide whether to select him as a batter alone in their 15-man squad for the 50-over tournament. Former Tigers captain Shakib has played 71 Tests, 247 one-day internationals and 129 T20s for Bangladesh. He has already retired from T20 internationals and has almost certainly played his final Test for Bangladesh, who do not have another Test scheduled before the Champions Trophy begins on 19 February.

The cuts will affect mainly employees on the business side of the storied US newspaper owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The publication is among many news outlets struggling in the digital age as a growing number of online platforms compete for advertising revenues. The layoffs come at a time of turmoil at the company after Mr Bezos broke with tradition and blocked an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in November. ""The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry"", a spokesperson for the newspaper said. ""Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future."" In 2023, the Washington Post reported losses of $77m (£45m) and falling readership on its website. That same year, the newspaper announced it was offering workers voluntary buyouts in a bid to cut headcount by 10%.  Mr Bezos wrote an opinion piece explaining that blocking the endorsement was necessary because of growing public perception that the ""media is biased."" Still, the newspaper said 250,000 of its readers cancelled their subscriptions in protest. Since then, several high-profile journalists, including investigative reporter Josh Dawsey, who confirmed on X that he was taking a job at The Wall Street Journal, have also left the newspaper. Managing editor Matea Gold is joining the Post competitor The New York Times, the Times confirmed.  The apparent conflict between Bezos and the newspaper's top talent took a turn for the worse on Saturday when Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, said she was resigning from the Washington Post. That came after the newspaper refused to publish a satirical cartoon that showed Mr Bezos and other tycoons kneeling before a statue of President-elect Donald Trump. Last month, Mr Bezos announced Amazon would donate $1m to Trump's inauguration fund and make a $1m in-kind contribution. Mr Bezos also described Trump's re-election victory as ""an extraordinary political comeback"" and dined with him at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6lg44jwwno","How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",2025-01-10,"Zoe Corbyn","Technology Reporter, San Francisco","This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments. Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill. It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure. The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery. ""We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,"" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. ""But we may be the furthest along the path."" Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists. That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms. Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021. Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design. Using AI to do drug discovery could make an ""enormous difference"" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (£1.6bn). It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success. A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery. ""We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,"" she says. It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI. A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 ""AI-discovered molecules"" have entered clinical trials with many more expected. ""That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,"" says Dr Meier. The next – and ""even bigger milestone"" – will be when they start to come out the other end. However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an ""AI discovered"" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement. There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier. The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't. While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions. The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target. This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one. Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work. Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned. In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise. All have been ""discovered from scratch using generative AI"", says Dr Zhavoronkov. ""Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria."" The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease. Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested. The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov. It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says. The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts. That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases. US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.  Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships. To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company. It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials. It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own. Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods. When that happens, says Dr Gibson, ""it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go""."

The list now includes items like microwave ovens, dishwashers, rice cookers and water purifiers. State-backed trade-in schemes already covered televisions, phones, tablets and smart watches as well as electric and hybrid vehicles. The world's second largest economy has been facing several challenges, including weak consumer demand and a deepening property crisis. On Wednesday, officials said 81 billion yuan (£8.9bn; $11bn) had been earmarked this year for the consumer goods trade-in scheme. China's top economic planning body has said the schemes, which were launched in March, have already produced ""visible effects"". According to the country's Ministry of Commerce, the policies have boosted sales of big ticket items such as home appliances and cars. But some economists have questioned whether the schemes will be enough to significantly increase consumer demand. China-based economist Dan Wang said ""the measure is far from being enough to boost consumption."" ""While it has supported sales of some listed goods, such as cars and appliances, it hasn't driven an overall uptick in spending,"" said Harry Murphy Cruise, head of China economics at Moody's Analytics. In recent months, China has been pushing ahead with more measures to support its domestic economy as the country's exporters face growing challenges. In December, a key meeting of China's leaders stressed the need for ""vigorous"" efforts to boost consumer spending. That came as President-elect Donald Trump, who is due to return to the White House this month, threatened to impose a 60% tariff on Chinese-made products. China is due to announce its 2024 economic growth figures next week, which Beijing has said it expects will be around 5%."

In a preliminary estimate, private forecaster Accuweather said it expected losses of between $135bn-$150bn as the blazes rip through an area that is home to some of the most expensive property in the US. The insurance industry is also bracing for a major hit, with analysts from firms such as Morningstar and JP Morgan forecasting insured losses of more than $8bn.  Fire authorities say more than 5,300 structures have been destroyed by the Palisades blaze, while more than 5,000 structures have been destroyed by the Eaton Fire. With authorities still working to contain the fires, the scope of the losses is still unfolding. ""These fast-moving, wind-driven infernos have created one of the costliest wildfire disasters in modern US history,"" AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said. The 2018 fire that broke out in northern California near the town of Paradise currently ranks as the disaster with highest insured costs, at roughly $12.5bn, according to insurance giant Aon.  That blaze, known as the Camp fire, killed 85 people and displaced more than 50,000. Aon said the high property values in this case mean it is likely to end up as one of the top five costliest wildfires on its list. Including properties that are not insured, the overall losses will be even bigger.  Even after the situation is under control, Mr Porter said the events could have long-term effects on health and tourism. It also spells trouble for the insurance industry, which was already in crisis.  Homeowners in the US with mortgages are typically required by banks to have property insurance.  But companies have been hiking prices - or cancelling coverage altogether - in the face of increasing risks of natural disaster such as fires, floods and hurricanes. As companies stop offering coverage, people are turning in surging numbers to home insurance plans offered by state governments, which are typically more expensive while offering less protection. In California, the number of policies offered through the state's Fair plan has more than doubled since 2020, from about 200,000 to more than 450,000 in September of last year.  Areas hit by the fires rank as some of the places with highest take-up, according to data from the programme, which was already warning of risks to its financial stability.  Denise Rappmund, a senior analyst at Moody's Ratings, said the fires would have ""widespread, negative impacts for the state's broader insurance market"". ""Increased recovery costs will likely drive up premiums and may reduce property insurance availability,"" she said, adding that the state was also facing potential long-term damage to property values and strain to public finances.

The 32-year-old man was at the airport on Monday to catch his flight to Canada when he was first stopped during security check. ""Upon examination, a skull with sharp teeth, resembling the jaw of a baby crocodile, weighing approximately 777g (1.71lb), was discovered wrapped in a cream-colored cloth,"" Delhi customs said in a statement on Thursday. The man was arrested and the skull was handed over to the Department of Forests and Wildlife, they said. Officials said the possession of crocodile skull violated India's wildlife protection law and its Customs Act. An analysis of the skull by the Department of Forests and Wildlife found that it belonged to a species protected under India's Wildlife Protection Act.  ""The texture, tooth pattern, well-developed bony palate, and nostrils confirmed the item as the skull of a baby crocodile,"" they said. A forest official told the Times of India newspaper that the man had allegedly bought the skull from Thailand. ""The man did not possess the mandatory permission required to carry wildlife items,"" forest officer Rajesh Tandon said. The man also told officers he had not hunted or killed the crocodile, the Hindustan Times reports. Further tests are being carried out to identify the exact sub-species of the animal. Meanwhile, Delhi customs says a case has been registered against the man and an investigation is under way. Last year, a 32-year-old Canadian woman was stopped at Delhi airport after she was found to have horns of an unidentified animal in her luggage.

Mr Altman, who is the chief executive of OpenAI, the firm behind artificial intelligence (AI) software ChatGPT, denied the claims in a joint statement on X with his mother and two brothers. ""All of these claims are utterly untrue,"" the statement said. ""Caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult,"" it added. Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing.

The announcements were part of CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address at CES, the major annual technology show in Las Vegas. The new family of gaming chips will use Nvidia's Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) technology to create movie-quality images, he told a packed arena. The chips will range in price from $549 (£438) to $1,999, and are twice as fast as their predecessors, he added. He also introduced an AI model, called Cosmos, which he said could generate video that can be used to train robots and self-driving cars at a much lower cost than current methods. By creating what is known in the industry as ""synthetic"" training data, the model can help robots and cars better understand the physical world. Users will be able to give Cosmos a text description that can be used to generate video of a world that obeys the laws of physics. ""All of the enabling technologies that I've been talking about is going to make it possible for us in the next several years to see very rapid breakthroughs, surprising breakthroughs in general robotics,"" he predicted, though he added much more training data would be needed. Mr Huang carried out a real-time demonstration of the new gaming chip that showed off highly detailed graphics featuring an array of textures and manoeuvres.

The list serves as a warning to American companies and organisations about the risks of doing business with Chinese entities.  While inclusion does not mean an immediate ban, it can add pressure on the US Treasury Department to sanction the firms. Tencent and CATL have denied involvement with the Chinese military, while Beijing said the decision amounted to ""unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies"". The Department of Defense's (DOD) list of Chinese military companies, which is formally known as the Section 1260H list, is updated annually and now includes 134 firms. It is part of Washington's approach to counteracting what it sees as Beijing's efforts to increase its military power by using technology from Chinese firms, universities and research programmes. In response to the latest announcement Tencent, which owns the messaging app WeChat, said its inclusion on the list was ""clearly a mistake."" ""We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business,"" a spokesperson for the company told the BBC. CATL also called the designation a mistake and said it ""is not engaged in any military related activities."" ""The US's practices violate the market competition principles and international economic and trade rules that it has always advocated, and undermine the confidence of foreign companies in investing and operating in the United States,"" said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington.  The Pentagon had come under pressure from US lawmakers to add some of the firms, including CATL, to the list. This pressure came as US car making giant Ford said it would invest $2bn (£1.6bn) to build a battery plant in Michigan. It has said it plans to license technology from CATL. Ford did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. The announcement comes as relations between the world's two biggest economies remain strained. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously taken a tough stance against Beijing, is due to return to the White House this month. The Pentagon was sued last last year by drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker Hesai Technologies over their inclusion on the list. They both remain on the updated list.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5v8klkqvo","Cryptocurrencies and personal AI: Tech to watch out for in 2025",2025-01-07,"Ben Morris","Technology of Business Editor","Not even AI can predict the future (yet), nevertheless two of our tech editors have taken a look ahead to what they think will be big in 2025. As 2022 drew to a close the outlook was bleak for the cryptocurrency business. One of its best know firms, FTX, had collapsed with $8bn (£6.3bn) of customer funds unaccounted for. In March of 2024, the company's co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried received a 25-year jail sentence for defrauding customers and investors. The scandal rattled confidence in the whole sector. It seemed that cryptocurrencies would remain a niche product, with an enthusiastic but relatively limited following. But just a few months later and the industry was fizzing with optimism again. Behind the enthusiasm -  the success of Donald Trump in the 5 November presidential election. The feeling was that he would be more favourable to the cryptocurrency sector and, so far, that seems to be the case.  In early December, Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to take up the top chairman role at the Wall Street regulator. Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than outgoing head, Gary Gensler. That announcement helped the value of one bitcoin, the biggest of the numerous cryptocurrencies, surge through $100,000. ""With Trump winning you can imagine in 2025 you'll get proactive regulation. You'll get removal of some negative regulation, which will then allow banks and other institutions into the space,"" says Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. In particular, Mr Kendrick points to a piece of guidance issued by the SEC called SAB 121. Since taking effect in 2022 it has made it difficult for banks and other financial firms to provide cryptocurrency services. Such a move might help Trump to fulfil his promise made in July to make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world. If he makes good on that pledge it would be a remarkable turnaround from 2021 when Trump described Bitcoin as a ""scam"". As AI tools move into our phones – Apple, Google and Samsung have all launched services that can edit photos, translate languages and carry out web searches – we are at the start of an era in which AI becomes an intrinsic part of our digital lives and increasingly helpful on a personal level. That’s if we allow it, because it does require a bit of a leap of faith. Let’s take diary management as an example. An AI tool efficiently can manage your diary for you, if you allow it to access it. But how far should this go? In order to be truly useful, does that mean it also needs to know who you would rather avoid meeting, or relationships  you want to keep secret, and from whom? Do you want it to provide you with summaries of counselling sessions, or medical  appointments? It’s deeply personal information, and potentially both hugely embarrassing and extremely valuable if some glitch meant it was shared. Do you trust the big tech firms with that kind of data? Microsoft is pushing hard at this particular door. It got into trouble in 2024 for demoing a tool called Recall, which took snapshots of laptop desktops every few seconds, in order to help users locate content they’d seen but couldn’t remember where. It has now made a number of changes to the product – which was never launched – but stands by it. “I think we’re moving to a fundamentally new age where there will be ever present, persistent, very capable co-pilot companions in your everyday life,” the firm's head of AI, Mustafa Suleyman told me recently. Despite the challenges, Ben Wood, chief analyst at technology research company CCS Insight, expects that more personalised AI services will emerge in 2025. ""The output will be continuously updated by drawing on evolving data sources, such as emails, messages, documents and social media interactions. “This will allow the AI service to be tuned specifically to a person's communication style, needs and preferences,"" he says.  But Mr Wood accepts that letting AI loose on your personal information will be a big step.  ""Trust will be essential,"" says Mr Wood. The more money pours into AI, then the more datacentres will need building. Training and running AI requires a lot of computing power, and works best with the latest computer chips and servers. Over the next five years as much as $1tn could be invested in datacentres by the biggest data users, including Google, Microsoft and Meta, according to CCS Insight. In Europe alone, between 2024 and 2028, data centre capacity is expected to grow by an average of 9% annually, according to property services company Savills. But those new facilities are unlikely to be built in the current datacentre hubs like London, Frankfurt, and Amsterdam. High property prices in those cities - Savills says that in London land prices can be as much as £17m per acre - plus tight electricity supply means developers will be looking elsewhere.  In the UK cities like Cambridge, Manchester and Birmingham could well be home to the next wave of datacentre construction. Elsewhere, Prague, Genoa, Munich, Dusseldorf and Milan are likely to be considered in Europe. At the heart of some of those new datacentres will be the latest computer chip from Nvidia, the company that dominates the market for chips used for AI. Unveiled in March 2024, the Blackwell chip is expected to start shipping in significant number in 2025. The new chip should allow tech firms to train AI four times faster and see AI operate 30 times faster than current computer chips, according to Vivek Arya, senior semiconductors analyst, at Bank of America Securities. Nvidia's biggest customers, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Coreweave are likely to get the tech first, according to reports. But other customers might struggle to get their hands on the super chip, with ""supply constrained in 2025"", according to Mr Arya."

Trump cited national security interests, but for many the territory's vast mineral wealth is the main attraction. Yet economic development elsewhere in the vast polar region has ground to a halt. Working conditions in the Arctic Ocean are extremely challenging at this time of the year for Norwegian fisherman Sondre Alnes-Bonesmo. The sun last rose at the end of October, and it is not due to appear in the sky again until the middle of February. In addition to the endless dark, temperatures can plummet below minus 40C, and storms can bring vast waves. Mr Alnes-Bonesmo, 30, works two six-hour shifts a day, during five-week tours on a ship called Granit. One of the largest factory trawlers fishing in Arctic waters north of Norway, and off the coast of Greenland, it doesn't stop for winter. Unsurprisingly, he prefers the endless daylight of summer. ""I do like it when the weather is nice, as we're not sent crashing into the walls and such, the way we are during storms, when the waves can be fairly big,"" he grins in understatement. Mr Alnes-Bonesmo is a participant in the so-called Arctic ""cold rush"". A play on words with gold rush, it began in earnest around 2008 when a series of reports identified vast mineral and hydrocarbon reserves across the Arctic region. Reserves that, together with large fishing stocks, could continue to become more accessible as climate change reduces ice levels. This reduction in ice has also increasingly opened up Arctic sea routes, north of the Canadian mainland and Russia. So much so that, in the decade from 2013 to 2023, the total recorded annual distances sailed by ships in the Arctic Sea more than doubled from 6.1 million to 12.9 million miles. The hope in the longer term is that cargo ships can travel from Asia to Europe and the east coast of the US, through Arctic waters above Canada and Russia. But the question Mr Alnes-Bonesmo now asks himself is this – did he arrive too late? Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 much of the planned economic development of the Arctic region ground to a halt as relations between Russia and the West deteriorated.  ""Russia had great plans in the Arctic,"" says Morten Mejlaender-Larsen, Arctic operation and technology director from Norwegian firm DNV. His company sets rules and standards for the maritime sector. ""They began constructing regional rescue centres complete with ships and helicopters to facilitate both destination shipping for gas, oil and coal projects in Siberia, as well as for shipping along the Northeast Passage [north of Russia]. ""[But] since the invasion of Ukraine, international shipping in the Northeast passage has all but stopped, apart from a few Chinese ships,"" observes Mr Mejlaender-Larsen. He adds that Norway has also halted oil and gas exploration in the region. ""It's completely stopped,"" he says. ""We don't expect to see any further developments in the Barents Sea north of Bear Island."" This small Norwegian island is some 400km (250 miles) north of Norway's mainland. Norway's scaled back ambitions in the Arctic have pleased environmentalists who have consistently warned about the impact of drilling for hydrocarbons on both wildlife and the fragile environment of the polar region. Last month Greenpeace welcomed the decision of the Norwegian government to stop the first round of licensing for deep sea mining in Arctic waters between Norway's Svalbard and Jan Mayen islands. Commentators say that while poor relations with Russia is a key reason why Norway is wary of ploughing money into Arctic projects, its interest in the polar region had already cooled. Helene Tofte, director of international cooperation and climate at the Norwegian Shipowners Association, says that in hindsight the outlook for shipping in the Arctic had been ""exaggerated"". She points out that despite the impact of climate change, the Arctic remains a difficult place in which to operate. ""Conditions in the Arctic can be extremely challenging, even when the absence of sea ice allows passage,"" she says. ""Large parts of the route are far from emergency response capacities, such as search and rescue, and environmental clean-up resources. ""Increased shipping in this area would require substantial investments in ships, emergency preparedness, infrastructure, and weather forecasting systems, for a route that is unpredictable and has a short operational season. At present, we have no indication that our members view this as commercially interesting."" Mr Mejlaender-Larsen points to a ""belief that thanks to global warming there'll be summers up there. That'll never happen. If it's minus 40C and it gets 3C warmer, it's still not warm."" Moreover, Prof Arild Moe, from Norwegian research group Fridtjof Nansen Institute, says the entire cold rush of the Arctic was based on exaggerated assumptions. ""The exuberance was excessive,"" says the expert on oil and gas exploration in the region. ""What the reports from 2008 referred to weren't actual reserves, but potential and highly uncertain resources, which would be risky, expensive, and difficult to locate and exploit."" Regarding Trump's renewed interest in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, authorities in Greenland and Denmark were again quick to reply that it was not for sale. Prof Moe says that Trump's ""crude and undiplomatic statement"" shows that the US under Trump eyes both security and economic interests in the island, including its ""rich mineral resources"". The Danish government also responded by announcing a huge increase in defence spending for Greenland. Elsewhere in the Arctic, Trump is expected to allow increased oil and gas exploration in Alaska, specifically in the resource rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This 19 million acre expanse is the US's largest wildlife refuge, and back in 2020 Trump authorised drilling in one section of it. Meanwhile, Canada is continuing to build a deep-water port at Grays Bay, on the north coast of Nunavut, its most northern territory. Grays Bay is approximately in the centre of the so-called Northwest Passage, the Arctic sea route north of the Canadian mainland. Back on the Granit fishing ship, Mr Alnes-Bonesmo says that, while he has earned good money, fishing quotas continue to go down to try to preserve stocks in Norwegian Arctic waters. Nevertheless, he is philosophical. ""After a few years at sea I've grown more scared of the Arctic Ocean, but I've also come to respect and value it for all its power and beauty."""

It comes as Meta's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, appears to be making efforts to mend ties with Trump, ahead of the US president-elect's inauguration this month.  Days ago former UK deputy prime minister and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Nick Clegg left his job as president of global affairs at the social media giant. The other new members of Meta's board include John Elkann, who leads European investment firm Exor, and Charlie Songhurst, a former Microsoft executive. ""Dana, John and Charlie will add a depth of expertise and perspective that will help us tackle the massive opportunities ahead with [artificial intelligence], wearables and the future of human connection,"" said Mr Zuckerberg in a statement. The social media giant also praised Mr White's role in turning UFC into a global business. In a post on Meta's Instagram, Mr White said he loves social media and is ""excited to be a small part of the future of [artificial intelligence] and emerging technologies."" Mr White has previously rejected any suggestion that UFC platforms hate speech, insisting he supports free speech. A year ago his tense exchange with a reporter who questioned why he allowed fighters to make anti-LGBT remarks went viral. ""People can say whatever they want and they can believe whatever they want,"" Mr White retorted.  The UFC boss has had a close relationship with Trump for decades. Mr White's appointment follows news that Sir Nick was being replaced at Meta by his deputy, prominent Republican Joel Kaplan, who has handled relations between the social media firm and the Republican Party. There has been an apparent thawing between Meta and Trump in recent months. Relations had been frosty at least since Trump was barred from Facebook and Instagram following the US Capitol riot in January 2021. In August, Trump wrote in a book that Mr Zuckerberg would ""spend the rest of his life in prison"" if he attempted to interfere in the 2024 US election. But the president-elect later softened his position, telling a podcast in October it was ""nice"" that Mr Zuckerberg was ""staying out of the election"", and thanking him for a personal phone call after he faced an assassination attempt. Mr Zuckerberg visited Mar-a-Lago and had dinner with Trump after his electoral victory in November. Earlier this month, he donated $1m (£800,000) to the president-elect's inauguration fund. "

The Police Service of Northern Ireland has warned of ""treacherous driving conditions"" after some vehicles got stuck in the snow on Monday night.  Belfast International Airport said that there may be some delays to flights while snow is cleared from the airfield. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice which is in effect for NI until 11:00 GMT on Tuesday. Overnight temperatures have fallen below freezing in the past week, and are expected to do so again in the coming nights. Earlier on Monday, the PSNI advised motorists to avoid the Coleraine Mountain area of Limavady, County Londonderry, as heavy snowfall left a number of vehicles stuck and traffic unable to pass. The area is now passable but the PSNI urged drivers to exercise caution while travelling in the area. The Frosses Road, between Ballymena and Ballymoney, in County Antrim, was also closed for a time on Monday following a multiple-vehicle collision. ""Road conditions in the area are treacherous due to the current weather,"" the PSNI said.  ""Please slow down, and increase your stopping distance from the car in front."" In a social media post on X on Monday evening, Belfast International Airport said: ""Snow showers can be expected throughout this evening which may lead to some delays while snow is cleared from the airfield."" They advised passengers to continue to check the latest flight information on their website or contact their airline directly for updates.  Cold weather payments have been triggered for eight postcode areas in Northern Ireland. The £25 payment, external is made to people living in areas where the temperature is recorded or forecast to be 0°C or below for seven consecutive days. The cold weather payments are made automatically to those who get a qualifying benefit, and people living in these areas do not need to do anything to claim the money. They will be paid to people living in the following postcodes in County Down: The Met Office's yellow warning for Northern Ireland, which began at 15:00 GMT on Monday, warns of rain, sleet and snow showers which will lead to icy stretches in untreated areas. In the Republic of Ireland, thousands of customers are without water as snow and icy weather conditions continue to grip much of the country. Irish national weather forecaster Met Éireann issued a fresh yellow warning for snow and ice on Monday afternoon for the entire country until midday on Tuesday. The weather in Northern Ireland is to turn drier and brighter mid-week. The Met Office said it was safer not to drive in icy conditions, but recommends a number of precautions that drivers should take it if is necessary: Cyclists have also been urged to stick to main roads, which are more likely to have been treated, and for all road users to leave more time to complete their journey. NI Water has reminded the public to be aware of the risk of frozen pipes, as they pose a risk to properties and possessions.

Durham County Council's John Shuttleworth and his wife were on the plane at Newcastle International Airport, while the Jet2 flight to Alicante was grounded due to poor weather on Sunday. Shuttleworth said he was frustrated by the lack of communication from the airline and that the runway ""was clear and planes were landing"". Jet2 said the plane was boarded in the hope the ""severe weather"" would improve, but ultimately the flight had to be cancelled.  Travel was disrupted across the North East and Cumbria after the region was hit by snow and ice. Shuttleworth said: ""I accept these things do happen but it's the fact that at the last minute they said, 'oh, we're not going to fly', but other flights that were scheduled after ours had already gone.

The couple stayed at a hotel in Newcastle rather than risk driving 45 miles (72km) home in poor conditions. Shuttleworth said he and his wife had booked themselves onto a Ryanair flight on Monday morning, which had arrived in Alicante.  Jet2 sent an email shortly before midnight on Sunday telling the couple their flight had been rescheduled for 07:15 on Monday.  Shuttleworth said that passengers may have missed the email because it was sent so late.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg6dg30vq0o","Biden bans offshore drilling across vast area of US",2025-01-06,"David Mercer","BBC News","US President Joe Biden has announced a ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of America's coastline, weeks before Donald Trump takes office. The ban covers the entire Atlantic coast and eastern Gulf of Mexico, as well as the Pacific coast off California, Oregon and Washington and a section of the Bering Sea off Alaska. It is the latest in a string of last-minute climate policy actions by the Biden administration ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump has vowed to revoke the ban ""immediately"" when he takes office, but he may find it difficult to reverse under US law. During his campaign, Trump pledged to ""unleash"" domestic fossil fuel production in a bid to lower gas costs, despite the US already seeing record high extraction rates. Announcing the new drilling ban, Biden said: ""My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation's energy needs. ""It is not worth the risks."" In a radio interview, Trump branded the ban ""ridiculous"". ""I'll unban it immediately,"" he said. ""I have the right to unban it immediately."" Trump has previously said he will reverse Biden's conservation and climate change policies.  For the new drilling ban, Biden is taking the action under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, which allows US presidents to withdraw areas from mineral leasing and drilling. The law does not grant presidents the legal authority to overturn prior bans, according to a 2019 court ruling. It means a reversal would likely require an act of Congress, which is now controlled by Trump's Republicans. The law also does not allow presidents to revoke any areas already leased for offshore drilling. Trump - despite being in favour of more oil and gas exploration and repeatedly deploying his tag line ""Drill, baby, drill"" during campaigning - has used the law himself to protect waters off the coast of Florida in 2020.  At the time, this was seen as an effort to garner votes from the state ahead of the 2020 US election, and the protection was due to expire in 2032. Biden's decision will protect the same area with no expiry date. The new offshore drilling ban covers more than 625 million acres (253 million hectares) of waters. After it was reported last week that Biden would introduce the policy, Trump's incoming press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it ""a disgraceful decision"". She said the move was ""designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices"". Environmental groups, however, welcomed the move. Joseph Gordon, from conservation organisation Oceana, said: ""This is an epic ocean victory. ""Our treasured coastal communities are now safeguarded for future generations."" An oil and gas industry trade group said Biden's decision would harm American energy security and should be reversed by Congress. Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said: ""We urge policymakers to use every tool at their disposal to reverse this politically motivated decision and restore a pro-American energy approach to federal leasing."" In 2017, during his first term in office, Trump tried to reverse former President Barack Obama's protection of 125 million acres (50.6 million hectares) of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.  Two years later, a US District Court ruled that the act did not allow a president to reverse decisions of previous administrations – meaning Trump could not revoke Obama's protections. It is expected that Trump - whose inauguration ceremony takes place on 20 January - will still seek to challenge Biden's move. A final legal decision could be made by the Supreme Court, which currently has a majority of Republican judges. Environmentalists and Democrats had been calling on Biden to introduce the ban because of concerns that any new drilling would threaten US ambitions to cut its greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change.  The International Energy Agency estimates that global oil and gas demand needs to fall by 5% annually to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C, which is seen as crucial to help avoid the most damaging impacts."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y41qg57pno","'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy",2025-01-09,"Jonathan Josephs","Business reporter, BBC News•jonathanjosephs","Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a ""stable yet underwhelming"" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us? Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row. However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues. ""From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,"" he said. In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly. Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called ""last mile"" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing. However, the biggest difficulty for global growth ""is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0"", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan. Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico. ""The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,"" says Mr Oganes. ""And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US."" New tariffs ""could be particularly devastating"" for Mexico and Canada, but also be ""harmful"" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama. He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that ""depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market"". That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains. Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: ""Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession."" The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead. In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the ""challenges of uncertainties in the external environment"", but said the economy was on ""an upward trajectory"". Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle. Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025. Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year. ""Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,"" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick. Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is ""more welcoming"" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere. However, Mr Hart points out that ""it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer"", and whilst ""companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China."" One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them. Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization. However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU. ""Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,"" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. ""[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary."" Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead. That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments. In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey. One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further. It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm. ""In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that. ""I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.""  Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation. A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of ""dynamism"" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says. ""If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around"". One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive. Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  ""everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,"" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes. He's hopeful that inflation and interest rates can continue to come down around the world, but warns that ""a lot of it will depend on what are the policies that get deployed, particularly from the US.""

The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered almost 1.79 million cars last year, down about 1% from 1.8 million in 2023. This comes despite the company lowering prices repeatedly last year in a bid to woo buyers and hold on to its rank as the world's top-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs). China's BYD, however, looks set to close the gap after reporting 1.76 million EV sales in 2024. The Shenzhen-based firm's total vehicle sales jumped more than 41% in 2024, year-on-year, to more than 4.2 million.  The surge was powered mainly by sales of its hybrid cars.  BYD sells 90% of its cars in China, where it has been extending its lead over foreign brands including Volkswagen and Toyota. It has benefited from a rise in car sales in its home market, as intense competition drove down prices and government subsidies encouraged consumers to replace their old cars with EVs or other more fuel efficient options. Tesla also counts China as a key market, but it has lost ground to rivals as the price war rumbles on. Demand for electric vehicles has also softened in other regions, such as the US and Europe, creating challenges for many carmakers.  Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors were among the companies that cut sales targets or decided to delay investments in EV technology last year.    At Tesla, its boss Elon Musk has blamed weaker sales in part on the jump in borrowing costs since 2022, which has made it more expensive to buy.  Analysts have also pointed to increased competition and questions about the brand, as Musk deepens his political involvement, which has been described as controversial. Tesla sales slumped in the first half of 2024 before starting to pick up again. In the final three months of 2024, it delivered about 495,000 cars, up 2% year-on-year and a quarterly record. But the firm's share price, which surged more than 60% last year, fell 5% in morning trade, as the figure came in below the roughly 500,000 forecast by analysts.  ""If you don't meet expectations, it can be pretty tough out there,"" said Christopher Carey of the Carnegie Investment Council.  Last month, Honda and Nissan confirmed that they were holding merger talks, as the two Japanese firms seek to fight back against competition from the Chinese car industry. Earlier in the month, the boss of car making giant Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, quit with immediate effect following a boardroom clash. His abrupt exit from the company - which owns brands including Vauxhall, Jeep, Fiat, Peugeot and Chrysler - came two months after Stellantis issued a profit warning. Some governments have stepped in to protect domestic companies. In October, European Union tariffs of up to 45.3% on imports of Chinese-made EVs came into force across the trade bloc.

The four-day promotion, which starts this Saturday (4 January), includes discounts of as much as 500 yuan ($68.50, £55.30) on some of the US technology giant's newest handsets. Chinese phone maker Huawei has also cut prices of its high-end mobile devices by as much as 20%. The discounts come as consumers in China remain hesitant about spending because of the country's economic challenges. The offer covers Apple's top models as well as older handsets and some other devices. The biggest discount of 500 yuan will apply to Apple's flagship iPhone 16 Pro, which has a starting price of 7,999 yuan, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max which currently costs 9,999 yuan. The firm held a similar promotion in China last year ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This year, the festival starts at the end of January. ""Apple's strategy has changed to adapt to the change in Chinese consumers' shopping behaviour,"" said Will Wong, a senior research manager for market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC). ""The value-seeking trend has made price discounts more attractive to consumers. Apple may fall behind other competitors if it doesn't adopt such a pricing strategy."" The discounts being offered by Apple and Huawei reflect a wider trend in China. From online retail giants to the country's car makers, deals are being offered in a bid to attract customers who have been reluctant to spend as the world's second largest economy slows. The Chinese government has also stepped up efforts to boost consumption. Last year, Beijing launched a trade-in programme to encourage consumers to replace old products such as cars and household appliances. The plan was expanded on Friday to include mobile phones, tablets, smartwatches and fitness bands. Against this backdrop, Apple's share of the Chinese market has come under increasing pressure from local rivals, such as Vivo and Xiaomi. The US firm re-entered China's top five smartphone makers in the third quarter of 2024 after briefly dropping off the list. According to IDC's latest research, Vivo was China's best-selling smartphone maker in the period as its sales jumped by more than 20%. During the same period, Apple saw sales dip by 0.3%. Huawei's jumped by more than 40%. ""We've seen market competition increase with almost everyone launching a flagship last quarter,"" said Ivan Lam, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Huawei has seen demand for its products surge after its return to the premium smartphone market in August last year. The Shenzhen-based firm has since launched several new devices powered by advanced technology despite the company facing US restrictions.  "

It marks a major defeat for so-called open internet advocates, who have long fought for protections that would require internet providers such as AT&T to treat all legal content equally. Such rules were first introduced by the Federal Communications Commission under former Democratic president Barack Obama but later repealed during Republican Donald Trump's first term. The decision, just as Trump is poised to enter the White House for a second term, likely puts an end to the long-running legal battle over the issue.  In their decision, the judges noted that different administrations have gone back and forth on the issue. But they said the court no longer had to give ""deference"" to the FCC's reading of the law, pointing to a recent Supreme Court decision that limits the authority of federal agencies to interpret laws, a decision that critics expect will be used to weaken regulation in the years ahead. ""Applying Loper Bright, means we can end the FCC's vacillations,"" the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said. Brendan Carr, a Republican member of the FCC who Trump has tapped to lead the agency, said he was pleased the court had invalidated the Biden administration's ""Internet power grab"". The FCC's outgoing Democratic commissioner said the ruling turned the issue over to Congress. ""Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,"" Jessica Rosenworcel said.  ""With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law.""  The fight over net neutrality was once a heated issue in the US, pitting internet providers against big tech companies such as Google and Netflix.  Comedian John Oliver famously urged his audience to express support for the rules, leading to a deluge of comments that crashed the government's site.  But the issue has faded in prominence since the rules were repealed in 2018. Thursday's ruling does not affect state-level net neutrality laws, which in some places offer similar protections. But advocates, like Mr Oliver, have said that national rules are important to preventing internet providers from having powers to throttle certain content or charge more for speedy delivery of their service. Public Knowledge, a progressive-leaning internet policy group, said the decision had weakened the FCC's power to shape privacy protections, implement public safety measures and take other action.  It said it believed the court had erred in ruling that internet service providers were simply offering an ""information service"" rather than acting as telecommunications companies.  ""The court has created a dangerous regulatory gap that leaves consumers vulnerable and gives broadband providers unchecked power over Americans' internet access,"" it said. But USTelecom, an industry group whose members include AT&T and Verizon, said the decision was ""a victory for American consumers that will lead to more investment, innovation, and competition in the dynamic digital marketplace."""

Its accounts show it made a pre-tax loss of £6.63m in 2024, which is worse than its £4.46m deficit in 2023 and the £5.73m it lost in 2019, the year it was bought by the Tees Valley Combined Authority.  In the company's results, managing director Philip Forster said TIA was developing other revenue sources to reduce its reliance on ""passenger-related elements"" of flying. Such work would include ""ground-handling and fuelling to commercial, general aviation and military customers"", he said. Despite its losses, the airport continued to enjoy strong sales and posted its second highest turnover in more than a decade at £14.91m. In March 2019 its turnover had stood at just £7.56m. In the company accounts, Mr Forster said the airport had struck a number of deals to bring new routes to Teesside throughout the year. This included TUI reintroducing flights to Dalaman in Turkey for 2024 and Ryanair running additional flights to Palma de Mallorca, Faro and Corfu during the summer. The airport is also looking to grow its income from its land and assets and has invested in a new 26,995-sq ft (2,508-sq m) hanger, which will soon house aircraft painting company Airbourne Colours. It also built its first unit at its £200m Business Park South site and has appointed Colliers and Aviation Real Estate Advisors to act as commercial agents for the park. TIA has also worked to expand its freight handling business and has invested in a new hangar that can provide security screening and freight forwarding services.  Logistics firm FedEx also signed a five-year deal for an airfreight handing facility at the airport. The Tees Valley Combined Authority has been contacted for comment.

It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy. Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania. But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (£4.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations. Since September it's laid off around a quarter of its global workforce including more than 1,000 staff in Skellefteå. ""A lot of people have moved out already,"" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefteå for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden. ""I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly."" Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs). In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that ""customers and markets are moving at different speeds"". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices. Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a €2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis. ""To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,"" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet. At Umeå university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called ""green industries"" says Northvolt presented a ""save the world mentality"" that impressed investors, media and local politicians. But this ""now-or-never"" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that ""never finished attracting investment"". Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans. The firm has hired German Marcus Dangelmaier, from global electronics company TE Connectivity to run Northvolt's operations in Skellefeå, from January, as it seeks to attract fresh investment. Northvolt's co-founder and CEO Peter Carlsson – a former Tesla executive – resigned in November. As the postmortem into the crisis continues, there are debates about the potential impact on Sweden's green ambitions. Northern Sweden, dubbed the ""Nordic Silicon Valley of sustainability"" by consultancy firm McKinsey, has swiftly gained global reputation for new industries designed to fast-track Europe's green transition. The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free steel using hydrogen. But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's ""very good brand"" when it comes to green technologies. ""There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,"" he says. Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact. ""I feel it myself when I travel now – even to the southern parts of Sweden – and abroad, that people really ask me questions,"" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefteå Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt. Headquartered in Malmö in southern Sweden, Cleantech for Nordics is an organisation that represents a coalition of 15 major investors in sustainability-focussed start-ups. Here, climate policy analyst Eva Andersson believes the nation's long legacy as an environmental champion will remain relevant. ""I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,"" she argues. Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023. Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%. ""Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,"" predicts Anderson. There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups – sustainable or not – should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash. ""The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,"" argues Andersson. Just 3% of global battery cell production currently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market. Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer. Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was ""not a Swedish crisis"", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector. But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs. ""This is a very politically sensitive area,"" says journalist Cervenka. ""The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer."" The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview. Back in Skellefteå, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow. He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being ""not as ambitious"" as previous administrations. The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefteå will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO. ""It's 100% almost renewable energy up here… and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity."" Skellefeå Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources). ""The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,"" says Mr Nordin."

The group are looking for support from other organisations before launching the festival in the new year. The first Romanian film festival for Suffolk was held in partnership with Ipswich County Library in September. Mr Mustata wants to build on that success with The Educational Festival (TEF). ""Through my volunteer experience, both as an individual and through the Ipswich Romanian Community, I have observed that local organisations, authorities, and the educational and healthcare systems often develop impactful educational projects. ""However, these initiatives often remain internal due to the lack of a public and creative event that could make education more visible and accessible to the broader community. ""The purpose of TEF is to address this need by showcasing these educational efforts and fostering a deeper understanding of British culture including other background nationalities and values."" According to data from the 2021 census, about 112,900 (80.9%) Ipswich residents said they were born in England.  Romania was the next most represented, with about 3,800 (2.7%) born there. This compares to more than 200 Romanian-born residents in 2011 (0.2% of the population of Ipswich at the time). In 2014, Romanians and Bulgarians were allowed free movement to the UK under European Union rules. Following Brexit, the rules changed at the end of 2020 so Romanian citizens need a visa to live, work, study, or run a business here. As of 31 March 2023, 1.48 million Romanians had applied under the EU Settlement Scheme to stay in the UK. The group are also focusing on supporting newer arrivals from Romania.

The payouts being made by the Madoff Victim Fund (MVF) are worth $131.4m (£104.6m) and will bring the total amount it has returned to 40,930 claimants to $4.3bn. Madoff, a Wall Street financier disgraced after he admitted to one of the biggest frauds in US financial history, died in prison in 2021. He had been serving a 150-year sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to running a so-called Ponzi scheme, which paid investors with money from new clients rather than actual profits. ""MVF's distributions offset one of the most monstrous financial crimes ever committed,"" said Richard C Breeden, who runs the MVF. Mr Breeden is a former chairman of the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ""We have brought tens of thousands of victims to the greatest recovery we could achieve,"" he added. Madoff's victims were a mixture of wealthy individuals, less well-off people and companies - both large and small - as well as schools, charities and pension funds. The MFV estimates it will have recovered nearly 94% of the victims' proven losses when it completes its mission in 2025. Another $14.7bn has been returned through bankruptcy proceedings to Madoff customers. Madoff's investment firm collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis. Set up in 1960, Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities became one of Wall Street's largest market-makers - matching buyers and sellers of stocks - and Madoff served as chairman of the Nasdaq stock trading platform. Over the years, the firm was investigated eight times by the SEC because it made exceptional returns. But it was the global recession which prompted the firm's demise as Madoff investors, hit by the downturn, tried to withdraw about $7bn and he could not find the money to cover it. The list of those scammed included actor Kevin Bacon, Hall of Fame baseball player Sandy Koufax and film director Steven Spielberg's charitable foundation, Wunderkinder. UK banks were also among those that lost money, with HSBC Holdings saying it had exposure of around $1bn. Other corporate victims were Royal Bank of Scotland and Man Group and Japan's Nomura Holdings."

The Jeju Air plane burst into flames as it crash-landed in South Korea's Muan International Airport, killing everyone onboard save for two crew members. Acting President Choi Sang-mok has asked investigators to promptly disclose their findings to bereaved families.  His request also comes as another Jeju Air flight turned back to Seoul shortly after takeoff on Monday, due to an unidentified landing-gear issue. On Monday, the Jeju Air plane departed from Gimpo International Airport at 06:35 local time (21:35 GMT Sunday) and returned less than an hour later after realising a mechanical defect caused by the landing-gear issue, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Landing gear refers to the set of wheels and other parts of the plane which support the plane during takeoff, taxiing and landing.  The aircraft that turned back was a Boeing B737-800, the same model as the one involved in the disaster on Sunday.  Thirty-nine of the 41 aircraft in Jeju Air's fleet are of this model. After Sunday's deadly crash, Boeing had said it was in touch with Jeju Air and that it stood ""ready to support them"".  The 179 passengers on flight 7C2216 were aged between three and 78 years old, although most were in their 40s, 50s and 60s, according to Yonhap news agency. Two Thai nationals are among the dead and the rest are believed to be South Korean, authorities have said. On Sunday, the ill-fated plane had skidded off the runway after touching down and crashed into a wall shortly after 09:00 local time (00:00 GMT).  A South Korean transport official had said that the plane had been attempting to land but was forced to hold off after air traffic control gave a bird strike warning - an alert about the risk of a collision with birds. Air traffic command later gave permission for the plane to land from the opposite direction, the official said. The airline's bosses bowed deeply as they gave a public apology at a press conference on Sunday. ""We deeply apologise to all those affected by the incident. We will make every effort to resolve the situation,"" the firm said in a statement. Jeju Air shares were trading around 8% lower in Seoul on Monday.

Scores of mangled and cracked vessels sit on stacks, gaping holes in their hulls, their rudders snapped off and cabin windows broken. Yet these were the lucky ones. At least they can be repaired and put back out to sea. Many others sank, taking entire family incomes with them. When Beryl lashed Barbados, the island's fishing fleet was devastated in a matter of hours. About 75% of the active fleet was damaged, with 88 boats totally destroyed.  Charles Carter, who owns a blue-and-black fishing vessel called Joyce, was among those affected. ""It's been real bad, I can tell you. I had to change both sides of the hull, up to the waterline,"" he says, pointing at the now pristine boat in front of us.  It has taken months of restoration and thousands of dollars to get it back to this point, during which time Charles has barely been able to fish. ""That's my living, my livelihood, fishing is all I do,"" he says. ""The fishing industry is mash up,"" echoes his friend, Captain Euride. ""We're just trying to get back the pieces."" Now, six months after the storm, there are signs of calmer waters. On a warm Saturday, several repaired vessels were put back into the ocean with the help of a crane, a trailer and some government support. Seeing Joyce back on the water is a welcome sight for all fishermen in Barbados. But Barbadians are acutely aware that climate change means more active and powerful Atlantic hurricane seasons - and it may be just another year or two before the fishing industry is struck again. Beryl, for example, was the earliest-forming Category 5 storm on record. Few understand the extent of the problem better than the island's Chief Fisheries Officer, Dr Shelly Ann Cox. ""Our captains have been reporting that sea conditions have changed,"" she explains. ""Higher swells, sea surface temperatures are much warmer and they're having difficulty getting flying fish now at the beginning of our pelagic season."" The flying fish is a national symbol in Barbados and a key part of the island's cuisine. But climate change has been harming the stocks for years. At the Oistins Fish Market in Bridgetown, flying fish are still available, along with marlin, mahi-mahi and tuna, though only a handful of stalls are open.  At one of them, Cornelius Carrington, from the Freedom Fish House. fillets a kingfish with the speed and dexterity of a man who has spent many years with a fish knife in his hands. ""Beryl was like a surprise attack, like an ambush,"" says Cornelius, in a deep baritone voice, over the market's chatter, reggae and thwack of cleavers on chopping boards. Cornelius lost one of his two boats in Hurricane Beryl. ""It's the first time a hurricane has come from the south like that, normally storms hit us from the north,"" he said. Although his second boat allowed him to stay afloat financially, Cornelius thinks the hand of climate change is increasingly present in the fishermen's fate. ""Right now, everything has changed. The tides are changing, the weather is changing, the temperature of the sea, the whole pattern has changed."" The effects are also being felt in the tourism industry, he says, with hotels and restaurants struggling to find enough fish to meet demand each month.  For Dr Shelly Ann Cox, public education is key and, she says, the message is getting through. ""Perhaps because we are an island and we're so connected to the water, people in Barbados can speak well on the impact on climate change and what that means for our country,"" she says. ""I think if you speak to children as well, they're very knowledgeable about the topic."" To see for myself, I visited a secondary school – Harrison College – as a member of a local NGO, the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network (CYEN), talked to members of the school's Environmental Club about climate change. The CYEN representative, Sheldon Marshall, is an energy expert who quizzed the pupils about greenhouse gases and the steps they could take at home to help reduce carbon emissions on the island.  ""How can you, as young people in Barbados, help make a difference on climate change?"" he asked them. Following an engaging and lively debate, I asked the pupils how they felt about Barbados being on the front line of global climate change, despite having only a small carbon footprint itself. ""Personally, I take a very pessimistic view,"" said 17-year-old Isabella Fredricks. ""We are a very small country. No matter how hard we try to change, if the big countries – the main producers of pollution like America, India and China – don't make a change, everything we do is going to be pointless."" Her classmate, Tenusha Ramsham, is slightly more optimistic. ""I think that all great big leaps in history were made when people collaborated and innovated,"" she argues. ""I don't think we should be completely disheartened because research, innovation, creating technology and education will ultimately lead to the future that we want."" ""I feel if we can communicate to the global superpowers the pain that we feel seeing this happen to our environment,"" adds 16-year-old Adrielle Baird, ""then it would help them to understand and help us collaborate to find ways to fix the issues that we're seeing."" For the island's young people, their very futures are at stake. Rising sea levels now pose an existential threat to the small islands of the Caribbean. It is a point on which the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, has become a global advocate for change – urging greater action over an impending climate catastrophe in her speech at COP29 and calling for economic compensation from the world's industrialised nations. On its shores and in its seas, it feels like Barbados is under siege - dealing with issues from coral bleaching to coastal erosion. While the impetus for action comes from the island's youth, it is the older generations who have borne witness as the changes unfold. Steven Bourne has fished the waters around Barbados his whole life and lost two boats in Hurricane Beryl. As we look out at the coastline from a dilapidated beach-hut bar, he says the island's sands have shifted before his very eyes. ""It's an attack from the elements. You see it taking the beaches away, but years ago you'd be sitting here, and you could see the water's edge coming upon the sand. Now you can't because the sand's built up so much."" By coincidence, in the same bar where I chatted to Steven was Home Affairs Minister Wilfred Abrahams, who has responsibility for national disaster management. I put it to him that it must be a a difficult time for disaster management in the Caribbean. ""The whole landscape has changed entirely,"" he replied. ""Once upon a time, it was rare to get a Category Five hurricane in any year. Now we're getting them every year. So the intensity and the frequency are cause for concern."" Even the duration of the hurricane season has changed, he says. ""We used to have a rhyme that went: June, too soon; July, standby; October, all over,"" he tells me. Extreme weather events like Beryl have rendered such an idea obsolete. ""What we can expect has changed, what we've prepared for our whole lives and what our culture is built around has changed,"" he adds. Fisherman Steven Bourne had hoped to retire before Beryl. Now, he says, he and the rest of the islanders have no choice but to keep going. ""Being afraid or anything like that don't make no sense. Because there's nowhere for we to go. We love this rock. And we will always be on this rock.""

Rights group Amnesty hailed the decision as a ""beacon of hope for the abolitionist movement in the region"", but expressed regret that the death penalty could be reinstated during a state of emergency.  Mnangagwa's move comes after Zimbabwe's parliament voted earlier in December to scrap the death penalty.  Zimbabwe last carried out an execution by hanging in 2005, but its courts continued to hand down the death sentence for serious crimes like murder.  About 60 people were on death row at the end of 2023, according to Amnesty.  They will be re-sentenced by the courts, with judges ordered to consider the nature of their crime, the time they spent on death row and their personal circumstances, the state-owned Herald newspaper reports.  Justice minister Ziyambi Ziyambi said the abolition of the death penalty was ""more than a legal reform; it is a statement of our commitment to justice and humanity"".  The death sentence was introduced in what is now Zimbabwe during British colonial rule.  Mnangagwa has been a long-standing critic of capital punishment, citing his own experience of being sentenced to death in the 1960s for blowing up a train during the guerrilla war for independence.  His sentence was later commuted to 10 years in prison.  The Death Penalty Abolition Act was published in the government gazette on Tuesday after Mnangagwa signed it into law. Amnesty said the move was not ""just great progress"" for Zimbabwe but also a ""major milestone"" in international efforts to end ""this ultimate cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment"".  It urged the Zimbabwean authorities to ""remove the clause included in the amendments to the Bill allowing for the use of the death penalty for the duration of any state of public emergency"". Mnangagwa's Zanu-PF party has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980.  It has repeatedly been accused by opposition and rights groups of ruling with an iron fist in its bid to remain in power. Globally, 113 countries, including 24 in Africa, have fully abolished the death penalty, according to Amnesty.  The five countries with the highest number of executions in 2023 were China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and the US, the rights group added.  You may also be interested in:"

The Edinburgh fighter, who was on the undercard of the Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Uysk's world title rematch, dominated a scrappy encounter in what was his second win since his only career loss last year. Lowe's chances were hampered by a cut in the fifth round, while the 30-year-old was twice docked points for losing his gumshield in the final two rounds. A tiring McGregor - who looked weakened by a hand injury in the later rounds - survived a late flurry to take the decision 96-92, 97-91, 97-91. McGregor, 27, was tipped for big things but has struggled to generate momentum in the last few years of his career having won British, European, and Commonwealth titles early on.

They trash the place the whole time."" Four rabbits among those found dead, dying or in a poor state in a field in Worcestershire have been nursed back to full health at an animal shelter. Dozens of domestic rabbits were found in Chaddesley Corbett last month, some with no ears or eyes, and smelling bad because they were in such a poor condition. Lyndsey Hill, who runs Greatfield Small Animal Rescue in Kidderminster, said Dave, Marco, Midnight and Trish ""love these edible toys, flinging them around"". ""They really do like the interaction, which is surprising because if I'd... been treated like this, I don't think I'd have been too keen on humans."" Nearly 100 were found dumped, with people running around trying to save them. Some had no ears or eyes and smelled bad because they were in such a poor condition, animal rescue volunteers said. The incident resulted in 56 bunnies being rescued alive, but dozens more were dead or ran into dense woods before they could be recovered. But two of the four at the shelter, Marco and Dave, have the promise of a new home.  Ms Hill said the response was ""phenomenal"" and Marco ""was a little poster boy"".  Vets had his photo on their page and one follower of the incident spotted him and tracked him down to the shelter, she added. They were ""really keen"" to adopt and delighted to discover he had a friend in Dave.  ""They probably won't be leaving us till the new year...  because they are still [on] ongoing antibiotics. ""Their new owners have been sending them goodies and donations, so we've been able to spoil them rotten."" The other two are expected to be offered to the public next year. Other rescued rabbits are recovering in other shelters. The RSPCA is investigating. Ms Hill said when the four rabbits were taken in, they were all underweight. ""They were all in shock I think pretty much. The ears were torn off, scabbed up,"" she added. But she said all of them were now ""doing so well"". ""They look plump. I think it's all the fluff on them, but they are gaining weight rapidly.  ""They're suckers for the forage and their fresh foods.""

Acting President Choi Sang-mok has asked investigators to promptly disclose their findings to bereaved families. He has ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operations. At the airport, police superintendent general Na Won-o explained amid angry shouts that the delay was due to officials taking their time to carefully identify all 179 victims, whose bodies were badly damaged in the crash. ""Can you promise that they will be put back together?"" a middle-aged man asked, visibly emotional. Another person asked for the victims' remains to be released as they were, but Na said officials wanted to make their best effort to collect and match as many bodies as they could. These grim details left some family members in tears, while most sat in stunned silence, exhausted. The Boeing 737-800, which was travelling from Bangkok to Muan International Airport, skidded off the runway after touching down and crashed into a wall shortly after 09:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Sunday. The accident killed 179 of the 181 people onboard, making it the deadliest plane crash on South Korean soil. Four crew members were among the victims, while two were rescued from the wreckage alive. The acting president's call for an urgent review of airline operations came as another Jeju Air flight turned back to Seoul shortly after takeoff on Monday, due to an unidentified landing-gear issue. On Monday, the Jeju Air plane departed from Gimpo International Airport at 06:35 local time (21:35 GMT Sunday) and returned less than an hour later after realising a mechanical defect caused by the landing-gear issue, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Landing gear refers to the set of wheels and other parts of the plane which support the plane during takeoff, taxiing and landing. The aircraft that turned back was a Boeing B737-800, the same model as the one involved in the disaster on Sunday. Thirty-nine of the 41 aircraft in Jeju Air's fleet are of this model. At Muan airport, among the relatives of victims that the BBC spoke to was Shin Gyu-ho, who lost his two grandsons and son-in-law. Frustrated with how long the identification process was taking, the 64-year-old said he had thought about smashing the PA system used for police briefings in anger. While the body of Shin's son-in-law has been identified, he was told that his two grandsons - a high-school sophomore and a senior - were ""too scattered to be recognised"". His daughter and granddaughter have holed up in a privacy tent at the airport  because ""they cannot hold themselves together"", he said. For Maeng Gi-su's nephew and his nephew's two sons, a celebratory trip to Thailand to mark the end of the college entrance exams ended in tragedy when all three died on the flight. ""I can't believe the entire family has just disappeared,"" Maeng, 78, told the BBC. ""My heart aches so much."" The 179 people who died on flight 7C2216 were aged between three and 78 years old, although most were in their 40s, 50s and 60s, according to Yonhap news agency. Two Thai nationals are among the dead and the rest are believed to be South Korean, authorities have said.  Five of the people who died were children under the age of 10, with the youngest passenger being a three-year-old boy.  One man in his sixties said five of his family members spanning three generations had been on the plane, including his sister-in-law, his daughter, her husband and their young children, according to Yonhap news agency. Many of the passengers had been celebrating the Christmas holidays in Thailand and were returning home. The cousin of one victim, Jongluk Doungmanee, told BBC Thai she was ""shocked"" when she heard the news.  ""I had goosebumps. I couldn't believe it,"" Pornphichaya Chalermsin said. Jongluk had been living in South Korea for the past five years working in the agriculture industry. She usually travelled to Thailand twice a year during the holidays to visit her ailing father and two children - aged 7 and 15 - from a former marriage.  She had spent over two weeks this time with her husband, who had returned to South Korea earlier in December.  Her father, who suffers from a heart disease, was ""devastated"" when he found out about her death, said Pornphichaya. ""It is unbearable for him. This was his youngest daughter"", she said, adding that all three of his children work abroad. Another 71-year-old father, Jeon Je-young, told the Reuters news agency that his daughter Mi-Sook, who was identified by her fingerprints, had been on her way home after travelling with friends to Bangkok for the festivities. ""My daughter, who is only in her mid-40s, ended up like this,"" he said, adding that he had last seen her on 21 December, when she brought some food and next year's calendar to his house - that would become their last moment together.  Mi-Sook leaves behind a husband and teenage daughter.  ""This is unbelievable"", said Jeon.  One woman said her sister, who had been having a tough time decided to visit Thailand as life began to improve for her. ""She's had so many hardships and gone traveling because her situation was only just beginning to improve,"" she told Yonhap news agency. The two flight attendants who survived the crash were found in the tail end of the plane, the most intact part of the wreckage. One was a 33-year-old man, with the surname Lee, who was rushed to a hospital in Mokpo, about 25km (15.5 mi) south of the airport, but was later transferred to Ewha Womans University Seoul Hospital in the capital, Yonhap news agency reported.  ""When I woke up, I had already been rescued,"" he told doctors at the hospital, according to its director Ju Woong, who spoke during a press briefing. The survivor, who suffered multiple fractures, is receiving special care due to the risk of after-effects, including total paralysis, Ju said.  The other survivor, a 25-year-old female flight attendant with the surname Koo, is being treated at Asan Medical Center in eastern Seoul, Yonhap added.  She has sustained head and ankle injuries but is reportedly in a stable condition. It's not yet known exactly what caused the disaster, but a number of eye witnesses say they could see that the plane was in trouble before the crash. Restaurant owner Im Young-Hak said he initially thought it was an oil tanker accident. ""I went outside and saw thick, dark smoke. After that, I heard a loud explosion, not from the crash itself. Then there were more explosions – at least seven,"" he told Reuters. ""We feel bad when accidents happen on the other side of the world, but this happened right here. It's traumatic."" Yoo Jae-yong, 41, who was staying near to the airport, told local media he saw a spark on the right wing shortly before the crash. Kim Yong-cheol, 70, said the plane failed to land initially and circled back to try again. He added that he witnessed ""black smoke billowing into the sky"" after hearing a ""loud explosion"", Yonhap agency reported. One firefighter who was dispatched to the scene told Reuters he had never seen something ""on this scale"".  BBC reporters on the ground have said the sounds of family members crying echoed through the terminal on Sunday evening, while others are angry at how long it is taking to identify the bodies. Hundreds remain at Muan International Airport waiting for loved ones to be identified. Some have given DNA saliva samples to officials to help identify the bodies of victims, and the government has offered funeral services and temporary housing to bereaved families. A national period of mourning has also been declared for the next seven days. But for all the loved ones of those who died, many questions still remain - not least the cause of the crash, and whether it could have been averted. ""The water near the airport is not deep,"" Jeon told Reuters.  ""(There) are softer fields than this cement runway. Why couldn't the pilot land there instead?"" His daughter Mi-Sook was almost home, so saw no reason to call and leave a final message, he says. ""She was almost home - she thought she was coming home"".

Representatives from Guernsey and Jersey have attended a forum in Caen to start the planning process, along with counterparts from the UK, Ireland, France and several other European countries. The year of celebrations lead up to the 1,000 year anniversary of the birth of King William I in 2028. A spokesperson for VisitGuernsey said the organisation was ""now working on how the Channel Islands can best tie in with this large-scale project to both commemorate and celebrate our shared history"". Unlike many parts of the former British Empire, the Channel Islands were never conquered or claimed by Britain - in fact, they were the ones doing the conquering. William - later King William I of England - became Duke of Normandy after his father Robert died in 1035. The Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of Normandy when William defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, being crowned English King on Christmas Day that year. When the Norman territories were lost to France during the reign of King John, the islands swore allegiance to the English Crown and were rewarded with a high level of independence. As a result, both Guernsey and Jersey retained strong connections with Normandy into the modern period. The connections include local languages based on Norman French, legal traditions modelled on Norman law, and even the English monarch being informally known as the Duke of Normandy, regardless of their sex. Plans for the celebrations come off the back of new daily ferry sailings from St Malo to Guernsey, which were announced by Brittany Ferries in November. VisitGuernsey said it was planning to promote the island in Normandy, as well as Brittany and Paris in France, and expected adverts to reach more than 500,000 people. It said Guernsey's outdoors was the most attractive part of the islands to French tourists. Jersey's new ferry company DFDS said it was still finalising its timetable, but had been in discussions with the port in St Malo. Follow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

Staring out from it is his grandfather, who started the company in 1914. But, as he looks around him and remembers the destruction caused by the flash floods which struck the eastern Spanish region of Valencia on 29 October, tears well up in Andreu's eyes. ""The water came in and water and mud covered everything,"" he says. ""And when it had gone, it left a terrible sight. All the stock we had was ruined, the machinery was useless."" He adds: ""All my life working. And for what?"" The floodwater left a six-feet-high (1.8m) mark on the wall, and although the water has now gone, mud still clings to the machines. Miraculously, the photo of his grandfather was not washed away. But, now in his sixties, and still waiting to see how much insurance money he might receive, Andreu is too disheartened to start over. The flash flood killed more than 220 people in the Valencia region, many of them caught in their cars, or on the ground floors of buildings when the tsunami-like waters hit. But as well as claiming lives, the disaster also devastated livelihoods. Valencia's chamber of commerce estimated that 48,000 companies have been affected. The towns and industrial belt surrounding the Mediterranean city of Valencia, which itself avoided the impact of the floods, were the worst hit. In total, the province of Valencia represents 5% of Spain's GDP, according to CaixaBank Research, which estimates that the disaster could reduce national economic output by one to two percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2024. Much of the damage has been caused on industrial estates. Diego Romá, executive president of the federation of industrial estates in the Valencia region (Feteval), says that ""thousands and thousands of jobs are in the air"" and that a total of 58 industrial estates were affected by the flood water. ""Most companies are working hard to resume production, but unfortunately there are maybe 10 to 20% of companies which are going to close,"" he said. The legacy of 29 October is still visible on the industrial estates. Abandoned cars sit on the side of the road covered in mud, debris has been pushed up against walls and the shutters of many businesses remain closed. Electro Fernández, an electricity installation company, is one of the few which has reopened, having lost €40,000 ($42,000; £33,000) worth of tools in the floods. ""We were immediately affected 100% because we lost our tools and vehicles,"" said Patricia Muñoz, who co-owns the company with her husband. She says that they are currently working at 10% of their capacity. ""We've cleaned the place, we've got all our employees here, and we've taken action to get going again,"" she says. ""But a lot of the companies on this industrial estate, and on others are nowhere near that, they are still cleaning up. ""This has been an absolute disaster. You only realise the scale of it when you see it for yourself."" Not far away is a car storage area, where hundreds of the 120,000 or so vehicles damaged or destroyed by the flooding have been removed from roads and piled one on top of the other. As part of a €17bn relief plan announced by the government in the first month after the tragedy, it promised to provide up to 10,000 euros to car owners to replace their vehicles. Businesses and self-employed workers are also due to benefit, with compensation for damage caused to homes and corporate premises. A furlough scheme is also in place. The Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told congress in late November that his government was ""making a titanic effort"" to ensure that the promised funds reach those in need as soon as possible. However, not everyone is convinced. ""I think that official financial aid is badly managed,"" says Toni Milla, president of a local business association in the town of Alfafar, which was heavily affected. He says that a lot of the relief for businesses promised during the Covid pandemic did not reach its destination. ""I think this time the same thing is going to happen,"" he says. Valencians' faith in their authorities has already been severely shaken by the immediate response to the disaster. Protesters have been demanding the resignation of regional president Carlos Mazón, who, it emerged, was absent from his office for several hours on the day the floods struck because he was having lunch with a journalist. Many believe his administration's delay in issuing an alert to the phones of people in the region cost lives. Mazón has rejected such claims. ""We did the best we could with the information available,"" he says. Others criticise the central government for failing to deploy the military and other resources more forcefully. Sánchez, however, has insisted that his administration ""fulfilled its duties and did so from the very beginning"" of the crisis. Meanwhile, help has been provided by the private sector. Alcem-se, a charity platform set up by local supermarket entrepreneur Juan Roig, says it has distributed €35m euros in non-refundable aid to 4,600 businesses. However, for many, including Mr Milla, the relief may not be enough. He owned a local TV channel, an estate agency and a bar and he has only managed to reopen the latter – partially – in the wake of the October floods. He lists several nearby businesses - including a petrol station, a gym, a beautician and an optician – which he says will not reopen. But it is not just urban areas which were hit on 29 October. The Valencia region is part of an agricultural heartland in south-eastern Spain, which exports large quantities of fruit and vegetables to the rest of Europe. Twenty-five miles (40km) south of Valencia city, José España visits his orange trees. Beneath them, oranges which were washed off their branches by the floodwater lie rotting on the ground. ""Farmers always say 'next year things will get better', but right now, the mood among farmers is very pessimistic,"" he said. The agricultural association he is a member of, AVA-ASAJA, estimates that well over €1bn euros worth of damage was caused on 29 October to crops alone. ""Farmers have had a few years now in which we've been abandoned, and the floods might end up causing a few more farmers than usual to leave the industry,"" he says. ""In order to get things back to how they were before the flooding, it's going to take two or three years."""

The walk outs began on Friday at stores in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Seattle, Starbucks Workers United said. The union added the strike action would spread each day and reach hundreds of stores by Christmas Eve unless a deal is reached. It follows the union calling for the coffee shop giant to raise wages and staffing, as well as implement better schedules for its workers. ""We are ready to continue negotiations to reach agreements. We need the union to return to the table,"" a Starbucks spokesperson said in response to the strike announcement. The strike marks the biggest Workers United action since the organisation started trying to negotiate a contract with the company more than two years ago.  The union has been picking up members since the first store in the US voted to join in 2021. It now represents more than 500 shops across 45 US states. ""It's a last resort, but Starbucks has broken its promise to thousands of baristas and left us with no choice,"" said Fatemeh Alhadjaboodi, a Starbucks barista from Texas said in a statement sent to the BBC by the union. Workers United has highlighted what it sees as an unfair pay disparity between its members and senior Starbucks bosses, including chief executive Brian Niccol. His annual base pay is $1.6m. He could also get a performance-related bonus of as much as $7.2m and up to $23m a year of Starbucks shares. Starbucks has previously defended the plan, saying that Mr Niccol was ""one of the most effective leaders in our industry"" and that his compensation was ""tied directly to the company's performance and the shared success of all our stakeholders"". The company, which has more than 16,000 stores in the US, also highlighted that it offers average pay of over $18 (£14.40) an hour, as well as ""best-in-class benefits.""  ""Taken together they are worth an average of $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week,"" it said. The strike comes at a tricky moment for the company.  The world's biggest coffee shop chain has seen flagging sales as it grappled with a backlash to price increases and boycotts sparked by the Israel-Gaza war. It replaced former boss Laxman Narasimhan in August, naming Mr Niccol to lead a turnaround. Under Mr Narasimham, the company had softened its once combative approach to the union, pledging earlier this year to work toward a deal. The strike at Starbucks comes as one of the most powerful labour unions in the US is staging a protest against Amazon, aiming to put pressure on the technology giant as it rushes out packages in the final run-up to Christmas. The Teamsters union said Amazon delivery drivers at seven facilities in the US had walked off the job on Thursday, after the company refused to negotiate with the union about a labour contract."

Like all cancers, the earlier it is detected the better. Most ovarian cancer starts in the fallopian tubes, so by the time it gets to the ovaries, it may have already spread elsewhere too. ""Five years prior to ever having a symptom is when you might have to detect ovarian cancer, to affect mortality,"" says Ms Moran. But new blood tests are emerging that use the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to spot signs of the cancer in its very early stages.  And it's not just cancer, AI can also speed up other blood tests for potentially deadly infections like pneumonia.  Dr Daniel Heller is a biomedical engineer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. His team have been developed a testing technology which uses nanotubes -  tiny tubes of carbon which are around 50,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light. In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood. Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them. But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint. In this case the fingerprint is a pattern of molecules binding to sensors, with different sensitivities and binding strengths.  But the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out. ""We can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all,"" he says. ""We can only see the patterns that are different with AI."" Decoding the nanotube data meant loading the data into a machine-learning algorithm, and telling the algorithm which samples came from patients with ovarian cancer, and which from people without it. These included blood from people with other forms of cancer, or other gynaecological disease that might be confused with ovarian cancer. A big challenge in using AI to develop blood tests for ovarian cancer research is that it is relatively rare, which limits the data for training algorithms.  And much of even that data is siloed in hospitals that treated them, with minimal data sharing for researchers. Dr Heller describes training the algorithm on available data from just a few 100 patients as a ""Hail Mary pass"". But he says the AI was able to get better accuracy than the best cancer biomarkers that are available today - and that was just the first try. The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street. Dr Heller has high hopes for the tech. ""What we'd like to do is triage all gynaecological disease - so when someone comes in with a complaint, can we give doctors a tool that quickly tells them it's more likely to be a cancer or not, or this cancer than that.""  Dr Heller says this may be ""three to five years"" away. It's not just early detection that AI is potentially useful for, it is also speeding up other blood tests.  For a cancer patient, catching pneumonia can be deadly and, as there are around 600 different organisms that can cause pneumonia, doctors have to conduct multiple tests to identify the infection. But new types of blood tests are simplifying and speeding up the process. Karuis, based in California uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help identify the precise pneumonia pathogen in 24 hours, and select the right antibiotic for it. “Before our test, a patient with pneumonia would have 15 to 20 different tests to identify their infection in just in their first week in hospital - that's about $20,000 in testing,” says Karius chief executive Alec Ford.  Karius has a database of microbial DNA which has tens of billions of data points. Test samples from patients can be compared to that database to identify the exact pathogen.  Mr Ford says that would have been impossible without AI. One challenge is that researchers don’t necessarily currently understand all the connections that an AI might make between the test biomarkers and the diseases. Over the last two years Dr Slavé Petrovski has developed an AI platform called Milton that, using biomarkers in the UK biobank data to identify 120 diseases with a success rate of over 90%. Finding patterns in such a mass of data is only something that AI can do. “These are often complex patterns, where there may not be one biomarker, but you have to take into consideration the whole pattern,” says Dr Petrovski, whose is a researcher at pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca. Dr Heller uses a similar pattern matching technique in his work on ovarian cancer. ""We know that the sensor binds and responds to proteins and small molecules in the blood, but we don't know which of the proteins or molecules are specific to cancer,"" he says. More broadly data, or the lack of it, is still a drawback. ""People aren't sharing their data, or there's not a mechanism to do it,"" says Ms Moran. Ocra is funding a large-scale patient registry, with electronic medical records of patients who've allowed researchers to train algorithms on their data. ""It's early days - we're still in the wild west of AI now,"" says Ms Moran."

In an interview with the BBC in Damascus, he called for sanctions on Syria to be lifted. ""Now, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime. The victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,"" he said. Sharaa led the lightning offensive that toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime less than two weeks ago. He is the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the dominant group in the rebel alliance, and was previously known by his nom de guerre of Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. He said HTS should be de-listed as a terrorist organisation. It is designated as one by the UN, US, EU and UK, among many others, as it started as a splinter group of al-Qaeda, which it broke away from in 2016. Sharaa said HTS was not a terrorist group.  They did not target civilians or civilian areas, he said. In fact, they considered themselves to be victim of the crimes of the Assad regime. He denied that he wanted to turn Syria into a version of Afghanistan.  Sharaa said the countries were very different, with different traditions. Afghanistan was a tribal society. In Syria, he said, there was a different mindset.  He said he believed in education for women.  ""We've had universities in Idlib for more than eight years,"" Sharaa said, referring to Syria's north-western province that has been held by rebels since 2011. ""I think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%."" And when asked whether the consumption of alcohol would be allowed, Sharaa said: ""There are many things I just don't have the right to talk about because they are legal issues."" He added that there would be a ""Syrian committee of legal experts to write a constitution. They will decide. And any ruler or president will have to follow the law"". Sharaa was relaxed throughout the interview, wearing civilian clothes, and tried to offer reassurance to all those who believe his group has not broken with its extremist past.  Many Syrians do not believe him.  The actions of Syria's new rulers in the next few months will indicate the kind of country they want Syria to be - and the way they want to rule it."

The Charity Commission took the decision after it carried out a statutory inquiry into the Quba Trust, which according to its website was based in Mayne Avenue, Luton, set up ""to alleviate poverty, provide disaster relief and promote the Islamic faith"". It said it ""found the charity was poorly managed and its now former trustees had a serious disregard for, or lack of understanding of, the importance of proper financial management and controls"". The charity has been asked to respond to the disqualifications and findings. The commission said the Quba Trust was set up to provide disaster relief and advance the Islamic religion in the UK and overseas.  It said routine monitoring first raised ""serious concerns"" about the charity's governance and financial management. ""This was of particular concern due to the charity's international operations in Pakistan."" The commission said the charity's then trustees also failed to act on regulatory advice and guidance, issued to make improvements in order for it to meet legal obligations. Some of the failings, which amounted to misconduct or mismanagement, included poor record keeping, lack of evidence of use of charitable funds used overseas - and late filings of accounting documents. The former trustees were unable to account for more than £250,000 transferred overseas, with a further £500,000 lacking a satisfactory financial audit trail, the regulator found.  ""This breached their legal duties and was in contravention of the governing document, which constitutes a breach of trust and is misconduct and/or mismanagement in the administration of the charity,"" the commission said. Separately, while the charity was largely inactive and under investigation by the commission, the body found it had spent more than £36,000 on a consultant. Three people, found to be unfit to be a trustee or hold senior management positions in any charity, were disqualified for periods ranging between five and 10 years. Since the inquiry, the current trustees have taken a number of steps to address the failures and weaknesses in the charity's governance, the commission said. Joshua Farbridge, for the Charity Commission said: ""Charities which operate internationally can be more vulnerable to abuse or harm as a result of where and how they operate. ""Our routine monitoring visit identified concerns which should have been addressed by the former trustees but were not."" Follow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X."

The workers say the online retail giant has refused to recognise their union and ignored a 15 December deadline to hold talks over their contract. Amazon's facilities in Southern California, New York and Illinois could be affected, according to a Teamsters statement. ""The corporate elitists who run Amazon are leaving workers with no choice,"" said Teamsters General President Sean M O'Brien.  ""Amazon must be held accountable to workers and consumers alike. If workers are forced onto the picket line, Amazon will be striking itself,"" he added. The union said it represents thousands of workers at 10 Amazon facilities across the US.  But an Amazon spokesperson, Eileen Hards, said the union ""has continued to intentionally mislead the public – claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers'. They don't. ""The Teamsters have actively threatened, intimidated, and attempted to coerce Amazon employees and third-party drivers to join them, which is illegal,"" she added. Earlier this week, a congressional investigation concluded that the e-commerce giant pushes its US warehouse workers to fulfil orders at speeds that could cause high rates of injury. The investigation led by Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders also said the company had refused to introduce changes to improve safety because of concerns about its profits. Amazon said the report was ""wrong on the facts"", and featured ""selective, outdated information that lacks context and isn't grounded in reality"". The company, which employs roughly 800,000 people in the US, has faced accusations about unsafe conditions at its warehouses for years. Those concerns ramped up during the Covid pandemic, when e-commerce exploded, leading to protests by its workers around the world. Amid the controversy, founder Jeff Bezos said the company needed to do better by its employees. Senator Sanders, who is known for his pro-worker stance, launched an investigation into Amazon's practices in June 2023. Senate staffers conducted 135 interviews and reviewed more than 1,000 documents. Their analysis of public records found that warehouses operated by Amazon recorded over 30% more injuries than the warehousing industry average in 2023."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62w5q52pngo","Jeremy Bowen: Assad's torture prison is worst I have seen",2024-12-16,"Jeremy Bowen","International editor","Saydnaya prison sits on a forbidding hill about half an hour's drive from the centre of Damascus.  In the last few days the entrance has been repainted in the green, white and black of Syria's revolutionary flag. The new colours did not dispel the sinister atmosphere of the place.  As I walked through the gates, I thought of the despair that must have gripped the thousands of Syrians who made the same journey.  One estimate is that more than 30,000 detainees were killed in Saydnaya in the years since the start of the Syrian war in 2011. That is a large proportion of the more than 100,000 people, almost all men but including thousands of women – as well as children – who disappeared without trace into Bashar al-Assad's gulag. Other parts of Assad's prison system were less cruel. Phone calls home were allowed, and families were allowed to visit.  But Saydnaya was the dark and rotten heart of the regime. Fear of being consigned there and killed without anyone knowing what had happened was a central part of the Assad regime's system of coercion and repression.  The authorities did not have to tell families who had been incarcerated there. Allowing them to fear the worst was another way of applying pressure. The regime kept its boot on the throat of Syrians because of the power, reach and savagery of its myriad and overlapping intelligence agencies, and because of the routine use of torture and execution. I was in other infamous prisons in the days after they were liberated, including Abu Salim, the former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's notorious jail in Tripoli and Pul-e-Charki outside Kabul in Afghanistan.  Neither were as foul and pestilent as Saydnaya. In its overcrowded cells men had to urinate into plastic bags as their access to latrines was limited. When the locks were smashed open, they left behind their filthy rags and scraps of blankets which were all they had to cover themselves as they slept on the floor. Torture and execution have already been documented in Saydnaya.  In the months to come it is certain that more information about the horrors perpetrated inside its walls will emerge from former inmates. In Saydnaya's corridors you can see how hard it will be to mend the country Assad broke to try to save his regime. Now that the prison has been broken open, like the country, it has become a microcosm of all the challenges Syria faces since the Assad regime crumpled and was swept away. One challenge is making a record of exactly what the regime did to its victims. In a sign of how far Syria has come in just a week, volunteers went to the prison to try to preserve Saydnaya's records.  Paperwork is scattered around offices and even on the concrete floor of the prison yard. Families pick up files and sheets of tattered documentation, trying to find a name, a date or a place that they recognise.  The disarray of the records looks as if someone tried to destroy what was done here in the name of Bashar al-Assad's Syria. When dictators and their henchmen fall, making sure they don't take the truth with them is a big part of a better future. A musician called Safana Bakleh gave her group of volunteers face masks and blue nitrile gloves along with instructions about photographing and collecting documents.  Safana admitted they were amateurs and said they were taking matters into their own hands because the international human rights groups were not there, and evidence and documents were disappearing. ""Even if one family gets one answer that their loved on is not here anymore is deceased or he died in the hospital it is enough for me"" Safana told me. ""It is very chaotic... Where are the international originations supposed to be documenting all this chaos?"" It is not just about families getting some release through at least knowing what happened to the disappeared. One day there might be trials of the perpetrators. Documents are evidence. The truth the volunteers uncovered with their own eyes shocked them. All Syrians knew that the prisons were bad, but Saydnaya was much worse than they expected.  Widad Halabi, one of the volunteers, took off her face mask and broke down in tears after an hour or so looking for evidence in the cell blocks. ""What I've seen here is a life not fit for humans. I imagined how they lived, their clothes. How did they breathe? How did they eat? How did they feel? ""It's terrible… terrible. There are bags of urine on the floor. They couldn't go to the toilet, so they had to put urine in bags. The smell. There's no sun or light. I can't believe people were living here when we were living and breathing our normal lives."" It will be hard for Syrians and their new rulers to track down the people they want to punish. Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia with his family. His brother Maher, with a reputation for violence and corruption as bad as anyone in his extended family, is thought to be in Iraq.  A couple of Assad's cousins ran into rebel fighters as they tried to escape to Lebanon. One of them, according to Reuters news agency, was killed in the resulting shootout.  When I entered Syria a week ago hundreds of cars full of despondent and scared families with some link to the regime, who believed they would be in danger in the new Syria, were leaving, queuing to get over the border into Lebanon. At the same time hundreds were driving in the opposite direction, desperate to get home. Eventually there might be a legal process to prosecute Bashar al-Assad, members of his family and some of those who carried guns for the regime. Gathering evidence would be part of that. But the exodus in the last hours of the regime and in the confused days and nights that followed means that it will be hard to get to the people responsible. At Saydnaya prison, families wander through the building, desperate for information, searching for those they've lost, horrified by everything they are seeing. Just being in Saydnaya's cells and corridors, freezing cold in December, reinforces a widespread desire to see the punishment of everyone implicated in the Assad regime's crimes. A group of men gathered in the prison yard, smoking silently, some leafing through files that they had picked up off the ground. All those I spoke to said that the future must be built on justice for the past. The men in the group, all looking for missing, sons, brothers and cousins, called Saydnaya a mass grave. They want the head of Bashar al-Assad, literally. They murmured agreement when one of them said he had to be decapitated. One of them, a young man called Ahmed, said he knew the brother he was searching for was alive because he could see him in his dreams. Ahmed himself had spent three years in Saydnaya. ""It was so bad, the torture, the food, everything. We were suffering."" Mohammed Khalaf, an older man, had been searching for his son Jabr since he was dragged from the family breakfast table by thugs from one of the state's intelligence agencies in 2014. ""We are many. People came from Qamishli, Hasaka, Deir al-Zour, Al Raqqa looking for our loved ones. Thousands are still in the streets looking for their children. It's not just me."" Inside one of the cell blocks, young men from Aleppo were warming themselves on a fire that they had lit in a metal tin, burning old prison uniforms that are scattered around every cell. They were looking for brothers who had been detained and then disappeared.  Like many others looking for information or a body at Saydnaya, the men had no money for a hotel. So they camped in the prison where they believe their brothers were consigned and most likely killed. One of the men from Aleppo, Ezzedine Khalil, wants news of a brother taken by the regime on 1 September 2015. They all know the precise dates. ""We don't know if he is alive or dead. If he is dead, they should give us his body. They should tell us if he's dead. We just want to know. We want to know what to do next."" His friend Mohammed Radwan was looking for a brother and a cousin who were detained in 2012. Rumours were flying around that the night before the fall of the regime, 22 freezer lorries were brought to the prison to remove bodies. The rumours have not been confirmed but Mohammed and Ezzedine were convinced that they were true. Mohammed looked exhausted and his anger flared up. He addressed himself to Assad. ""Where did you, pig, take the 22 fridge trucks? Everyone who took part in this crime, and everyone who served her in Saydnaya prison should be brought to justice. Everyone! Even if they were working in cleaning. They should all be brought to account."" ""Because if they knew what was happening, at least they should have told the families of the prisoners that their dear ones were killed, slaughtered, hanged or tortured."" Both men ended with an Islamic prayer: ""Allah is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs."" Their hunger to see Assad and his men punished could become one of the drivers of events in the next few months. Syrians want to see their tormentors punished. The extended Assad clan used Syria as their bank account. They helped themselves to stakes in businesses that might make profits. They controlled the lucrative market for telecoms and mobiles. As they raked in cash, Syrians struggled to eke out a living in an economy smashed by war and drained dry by rapacious and corrupt regime favourites. The new rulers of Syria have inherited big debts and an almost worthless currency. A couple of hundred dollars equals a plastic trash bag of bundles of Syrian pounds. Corruption extended to the prison system. Victims and families desperate to avoid years in a hell-hole were prepared to pay big money to stay out. Hassan Abu Shwarb served 11 years under sentence of death for terrorism, which was the word the Assad regime used for rebellion. Hassan, a quietly spoken man who is now 31, denies he ever joined an armed group. Instead, he says he was detained at a government office when he was getting documents necessary to apply for a passport so he could accept an offer to study in Canada.  His brother said the family paid a total of $50,000 (£39,509) in bribes on five separate occasions to try to get him out. In all cases the corrupt officials who had offered help for cash pocketed the money without releasing Hassan. A couple of weeks before the regime collapsed yet another corrupt judge offered to free Hassan for another $50,000. After his arrest Hassan Abu Shwarb was tortured when he was detained for 80 days at a military intelligence interrogation centre. Among other injuries, the torturers broke one of his legs. Hassan says he was with one of his cellmates, a 49-year-old man, when he died after three days of torture. The jailors recorded death from a stroke. Hassan was overjoyed to get home. ""When my mother held me after 11 years, I can't describe the feeling. There is nothing like going back to your home and neighbourhood."" But like many Syrians, Hassan's optimism about the future starts with determination that the fallen regime's leaders and acolytes should suffer for their deeds. ""They should be punished. We are human souls, not stones after all. And those who killed should be publicly executed. Otherwise, we won't get through this. ""We need to forget and move on. This is a happiness for all Syrians. We need to return to our work and responsibility to continue. We need to forget. We turned the page. All the sadness is behind us."" The leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has started using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, instead of his war time pseudonym, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. The name change contains a message about looking ahead. The evidence is that Ahmed al-Sharaa will need to prioritise justice for the deposed regime if he does not want the chaos of people taking matters into their own hands. The future is hard, and the past is full of pain. Here in Damascus, it feels as if a collective weight has been lifted from the shoulders of a nation.  Syrians know how deep their problems go. To preserve the optimism created by Assad's fall, Syrians want to see progress."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk4pm8xxx8o","Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",2024-12-17,"Christine Ro","Technology Reporter","This is the second feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments. Terry Quinn was only in his teens when he was diagnosed with diabetes. In some ways he rebelled against the label and frequent tests, not wanting to feel different. His biggest fear was of someday needing to have his foot amputated. Vision loss, another possible complication of diabetes, wasn’t really on his radar. “I never thought I’d lose my sight,” says Quinn, who lives in West Yorkshire. But one day he noticed bleeding in his eye. Doctors told him he had diabetic retinopathy: diabetes-related damage to blood vessels in the retinas. This required laser treatments and then injections. Eventually the treatments weren’t enough to prevent the deterioration of his vision. He would hurt his shoulder walking into lampposts. He couldn’t make out his son’s face. And he had to give up driving. “I felt pathetic. I felt like this shadow of a man that couldn’t do anything,” he remembers. One thing that helped him climb out of his despair was the support of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which connected him with a black Labrador named Spencer. “He saved my life,” says Quinn, who is now a fundraiser for Guide Dogs. In the UK the NHS invites patients for diabetic eye screening every one or two years.  US guidelines are that every adult with type 2 diabetes should be screened at diagnosis of diabetes, and then annually if there are no issues. Yet for many people, that doesn’t happen in practice. “There’s very clear evidence that screening prevents vision loss,” says Roomasa Channa, a retina specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US. In the US barriers include cost, communication and convenience. Dr Channa believes that making the tests easier to access would help patients. To screen for diabetic retinopathy health professionals take pictures of the rear interior wall of the eye, known as the fundus.  Currently, interpreting fundus images manually is “a lot of repetitive work”, Dr Channa says. But some think that artificial intelligence (AI) could speed up the process and make it cheaper. Diabetic retinopathy develops in fairly clear stages, which means that AI can be trained to pick it up.  In some cases, AI could decide whether a referral to an eye specialist is needed, or work in tandem with human image graders. One such system was developed by the health technology company Retmarker, based in Portugal. Its system identifies fundus images that could be problematic and sends them to a human expert for further investigation.  “Normally we use it more as a support tool to give information to the human to make a decision,” says João Diogo Ramos, Retmarker’s chief executive. He believes that fear of change is limiting the take-up of AI-powered diagnostic tools like this. Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk’s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease. In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems. Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy. It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios. One problem is that the algorithm required pristine fundus images. This was a far cry from the realities of occasionally dirty lenses, unpredictable lighting, and camera operators with different levels of training. Researchers say they have learned lessons about the importance of working with better data and consulting a wide range of people. Google is confident enough in its model that in October, the company announced that it was licensing it to partners in Thailand and India. Google also said that it was working with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tool. Cost is a very important aspect of the new technology.  Mr Ramos says that Retmarker's service could cost around €5 per screening, though with variations according to volume and location. In the US, medical billing codes are set considerably higher. In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening. The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives. The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over. This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service’s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025. However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening. So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.  Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn’t the case for the rest of the world. “With the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it’s possible, but more and more whether we’re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,” Dr Mateen urges. Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. “We do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.” She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect. But even with those caveats, “the technology is very exciting,” says Dr Channa. “I would love to see all our patients with diabetes screened in a timely fashion. And I think given the burden of diabetes, this is a really potentially great solution.” Back in Yorkshire, Mr Quinn certainly hopes the new tech takes off. If AI had existed for earlier detection of his diabetic retinopathy, “I’d have grabbed it with both hands.”"

Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were due to be back after just a week when they blasted off in June. Their stay was extended to February next year because of technical issues with the experimental spacecraft, Starliner, built by Boeing. Now - following a delay in launching a new capsule to the ISS - the pair won't be back until late March or possibly April. Nasa said the delay posed no risk to the astronauts. In a statement Nasa stated: ""The International Space Station recently received two resupply flights in November and is well-stocked with everything the crew needs, including food, water, clothing, and oxygen. The resupply spacecraft also carried special items for the crew to celebrate the holidays aboard the orbital platform.""  Most space station missions last six months, with a few reaching a full year. So the extension to Butch and Suni's already overdue stay in space should not be a problem, according to Dr Simeon Barber, from the Open University. ""I'm sure that they are already disappointed that they were going to miss Christmas back home with the folks. But this is only another two months on an already quite long mission, and I'm sure if you ask them, I'm sure they would tell you that the space station is where they love to be,"" he said. A new crew needs to launch before Wilmore and Williams can return and the next mission has been delayed by more than a month, according to the space agency. Nasa's next crew of four for the ISS was supposed to have been launched in February 2025. The capsule carrying that crew was due to be the one bringing Butch and Sunni home, as well as NASA astronauts Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov as part of the normal crew rotation. But there has been a delay by the private sector firm SpaceX in preparing a brand-new Dragon capsule for the mission. That is now scheduled for flight readiness no earlier than late March. Nasa said it considered using a different SpaceX capsule to fly up the replacement crew to keep the flights on schedule.  But it has now decided the best option is to wait for the new capsule to transport the next crew."

The 47-year-old former Ireland fly-half led La Rochelle to successive Champions Cup triumphs in 2022 and 2023 after working as an assistant at Racing 92 and New Zealand's Crusaders. ""You have got to have those ambitions because you want to be the best you can be,"" O'Gara said. ""There are Test jobs I would bite people's hands off for."" While there are no current vacancies, under-pressure Wales coach Warren Gatland's future is being considered by the Welsh Rugby Union, with the New Zealander saying he will discuss with his family whether he still wants to continue in his role. However, O'Gara said he was not considering the possibility of succeeding Gatland. ""I haven't thought about that, to be honest with you,"" he added. ""Without lacking humility, I would prefer Ireland, England or France."" O'Gara removed himself from the running for the England job after Eddie Jones was sacked in 2022, signing a five-year contract extension with La Rochelle. That deal expires in the summer of 2027, potentially offering O'Gara the chance to take on an international role after the Rugby World Cup in Australia later that year. La Rochelle's bid for a third straight European crown ended in quarter-final defeat by Leinster last season. They are still chasing a first Top 14 crown with O'Gara twice suffering defeat in the French game's showpiece final, losing to Toulouse in 2021 and 2023. However, La Rochelle, who beat Bath in their opening European game on Friday, have made a slow start to the current campaign, lying sixth in their domestic standings. ""In France I am seen as very demanding and difficult because of standards I try and keep, but I just want players to try and experience what I did,"" said O'Gara, who won two European crowns with Munster and a Grand Slam with Ireland as a player. ""I got so much out of the game. It gave me wonderful emotions, and now I want to really try and give back."" La Rochelle play Bristol at home in the second of their four Champions Cup pool games on Saturday evening."

Terry Quinn was only in his teens when he was diagnosed with diabetes. In some ways he rebelled against the label and frequent tests, not wanting to feel different. His biggest fear was of someday needing to have his foot amputated. Vision loss, another possible complication of diabetes, wasn’t really on his radar. “I never thought I’d lose my sight,” says Quinn, who lives in West Yorkshire. But one day he noticed bleeding in his eye. Doctors told him he had diabetic retinopathy: diabetes-related damage to blood vessels in the retinas. This required laser treatments and then injections. Eventually the treatments weren’t enough to prevent the deterioration of his vision. He would hurt his shoulder walking into lampposts. He couldn’t make out his son’s face. And he had to give up driving. “I felt pathetic. I felt like this shadow of a man that couldn’t do anything,” he remembers. One thing that helped him climb out of his despair was the support of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which connected him with a black Labrador named Spencer. “He saved my life,” says Quinn, who is now a fundraiser for Guide Dogs. In the UK the NHS invites patients for diabetic eye screening every one or two years.  US guidelines are that every adult with type 2 diabetes should be screened at diagnosis of diabetes, and then annually if there are no issues. Yet for many people, that doesn’t happen in practice. “There’s very clear evidence that screening prevents vision loss,” says Roomasa Channa, a retina specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US. In the US barriers include cost, communication and convenience. Dr Channa believes that making the tests easier to access would help patients. To screen for diabetic retinopathy health professionals take pictures of the rear interior wall of the eye, known as the fundus.  Currently, interpreting fundus images manually is “a lot of repetitive work”, Dr Channa says. But some think that artificial intelligence (AI) could speed up the process and make it cheaper. Diabetic retinopathy develops in fairly clear stages, which means that AI can be trained to pick it up.  In some cases, AI could decide whether a referral to an eye specialist is needed, or work in tandem with human image graders. One such system was developed by the health technology company Retmarker, based in Portugal. Its system identifies fundus images that could be problematic and sends them to a human expert for further investigation.  “Normally we use it more as a support tool to give information to the human to make a decision,” says João Diogo Ramos, Retmarker’s chief executive. He believes that fear of change is limiting the take-up of AI-powered diagnostic tools like this. Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk’s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease. In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems. Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy. It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios. One problem is that the algorithm required pristine fundus images. This was a far cry from the realities of occasionally dirty lenses, unpredictable lighting, and camera operators with different levels of training. Researchers say they have learned lessons about the importance of working with better data and consulting a wide range of people. Google is confident enough in its model that in October, the company announced that it was licensing it to partners in Thailand and India. Google also said that it was working with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tool. Cost is a very important aspect of the new technology.  Mr Ramos says that Retmarker's service could cost around €5 per screening, though with variations according to volume and location. In the US, medical billing codes are set considerably higher. In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening. The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives. The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over. This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service’s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025. However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening. So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.  Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn’t the case for the rest of the world. “With the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it’s possible, but more and more whether we’re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,” Dr Mateen urges. Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. “We do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.” She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect. But even with those caveats, “the technology is very exciting,” says Dr Channa. “I would love to see all our patients with diabetes screened in a timely fashion. And I think given the burden of diabetes, this is a really potentially great solution.” Back in Yorkshire, Mr Quinn certainly hopes the new tech takes off. If AI had existed for earlier detection of his diabetic retinopathy, “I’d have grabbed it with both hands.”"

The wider scheme allegedly involves thousands of North Korean IT workers who use false, stolen, and borrowed identities from people in the US and other countries to get hired and work remotely for US firms. The indictement says the defendants and others working with them generated at least $88m (£51.5m) for the North Korean regime over a six-year period. North Korea's mission to the UN did not immediately reply to a request for comment from BBC News. The prosecutors say the suspects worked for two North Korean-controlled companies - China-based Yanbian Silverstar and Russia-based Volasys Silverstar. They were among a group of 130 North Korean IT workers employed by the two firms where they were internally referred to as ""IT Warriors"", according to the US Department of Justice.  The suspects were allegedly ordered to seek salaries of $10,000 a month from their US employers.  On top of the monthly wage, they would also raise funds for the North Korean regime by stealing valuable company information and threatening to leak it unless the employer made an extortion payment. The group is now facing wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft and other charges. Aside from using stolen identities to avoid detection, prosecutors said they paid people residing in the US to receive, set up, and host laptops provided by the US employers.  They would then instruct those US residents to install remote access software allowing them to appear to be working from the US when they were actually overseas. Investigators believe the suspects are in North Korea making it unlikely that they will ever face justice. Still, the US State Department has announced that it will offer a reward of up to $5m for anyone who can provide more information on the suspects as well as Yanbian and Volasys. US officials have not named the American companies targeted in the scheme.  ""While we have disrupted this group and identified its leadership, this is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Ashley T. Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI's field office in St Louis. ""The government of North Korea has trained and deployed thousands of IT workers to perpetrate this same scheme against US companies every day."" "

Prosecutors say Tal and Oren Alexander, who are known for selling high-end properties in New York and Miami, along with their brother Alon, used their wealth to take advantage of women. The brothers were arrested in Florida on Wednesday and are expected to be taken to New York to face the charges. A lawyer representing Oren Alexander rejected the accusations. Alon Alexander's lawyer said her client will be pleading not guilty. Tal Alexander's representative, Joel Denaro, declined to comment.  ""As of today, law enforcement has interviewed dozens of women who reported being forcibly raped or sexually assaulted by at least one of the Alexander brothers,"" said Damian Williams, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, at a press conference in Manhattan. ""This conduct, as alleged, was heinous."" On Friday, two of the brothers were granted bond after their father put up his mansion as collateral.  The county bond agreement allows for Alon and Oren Alexander to be held on home confinement pending trial. However, they will continue to be held in jail on federal charges for now, according to Miami media outlets. The prosecutors say the alleged crimes were committed over more than a decade. The indictment describes a scheme that involved inviting women to parties as well as using the promise of luxury experiences and travel to lure them to locations in the US and abroad where the alleged assaults happened.  It also says they procured drugs and provided them to the women and, at times, ""surreptitiously"" put them in drinks.  Finally, prosecutors also say that in some instances the brothers ""physically restrained and held down their victims during the rapes and sexual assaults and ignored screams and explicit requests to stop"". Immediately after the assaults, the brothers allegedly provided some of the victims with concert tickets and other luxury items. The three brothers are being charged with one count each of engaging in a sex trafficking conspiracy, and a second count of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion. Tal Alexander is also charged with a further count of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion. ""Oren Alexander is innocent,"" said his lawyer, Susan Necheles. ""The evidence will show that neither he nor his brothers ever committed a crime."" Meanwhile, a lawyer representing the women welcomed the indictment.  ""We are glad to hear that there will finally be some measure of accountability for the Alexander brothers and justice for their many victims,"" said David Gottlieb in a statement posted by his law firm Wigdor LLP on X. ""We applaud all the survivors who have had the strength and courage to speak up about their unimaginable experiences after years of pain and suffering."" Tal and Oren Alexander have worked for real estate giant Douglas Elliman, listing properties for celebrities including Liam Gallagher, Lindsay Lohan, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. In 2022, they started a firm called Official."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp555xy5ro","What is rage-baiting and why is it profitable?",2024-12-10,"Sam Gruet & Megan Lawton","Technology Reporters","“I get a lot of hate”. The words of content creator Winta Zesu, who last year made $150,000 (£117,000) from posting on social media. What separates Winta from other influencers? The people commenting on her posts and driving traffic to her videos are often doing so out of anger. “Every single video of mine that has gained millions of views is because of hate comments,” the 24-year-old explains. In those videos, she documents the life of a New York City model, whose biggest problem is being too pretty. What some in the comments don’t realise, is that Winta is playing a character. “I get a lot of nasty comments, people say ‘you're not the prettiest girl’ or ‘please bring yourself down, you have too much confidence’,” she says to the BBC from her New York City apartment. Winta is part of a growing group of online creators making ‘rage bait’ content, where the goal is simple: record videos, produce memes and write posts that make other users viscerally angry, then bask in the thousands, or even millions, of shares and likes. It differs from its internet-cousin clickbait, where a headline is used to tempt a reader to click through to view a video or article. As marketing podcaster Andrea Jones notes: “A hook reflects what's in that piece of content and comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.” But the grip negative content has on human psychology is something that is hardwired into us, according to Dr William Brady, who studies how the brain interacts with new technologies. “In our past, this is the kind of content that we really needed to pay attention to,” he explains, “so we have these biases built into our learning and our attention.” The growth in rage baiting content has coincided with the major social media platforms paying creators more for their content. These creator programs - which reward users for likes, comments and shares, and allow them to post sponsored content - have been linked to its rise. “If we see a cat, we're like ‘oh, that's cute’ and scroll on. But if we see someone doing something obscene, we may type in the comments ‘this is terrible’, and that sort of comment is seen as a higher quality engagement by the algorithm,” explains marketing podcaster Andréa Jones. ""The more content a user creates the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. ""And so, some creators will do anything to get more views, even if it is negative or inciting rage and anger in people,” she says with a note of concern. ""It leads to disengagement."" Rage bait content comes in many forms, from outrageous food recipes, to attacks on your favourite popstar. But in a year of global elections, particularly in the US, rage baiting has spread to politics too. As Dr Brady observes: ""There has been a spike in the build up to elections, because it's an effective way to mobilize your political group to potentially vote and take action.” He notes the American election was light on policy, and instead centred around outrage, adding, “it was hyper-focused on ‘Trump is horrible for this reason’ or ‘Harris is horrible for that reason’.” An investigation from BBC social media investigations correspondent Marianna Spring found some users on X were being paid ""thousands of dollars"" by the social media site, for sharing content including misinformation, AI-generated images and unfounded conspiracy theories.  Some who study the trends are concerned that too much negative content can lead to the average person “switching off”. “It can be draining to have such high emotions all the time,” says Ariel Hazel, assistant professor of communication and media at the University of Michigan. “It turns them off the news environment and we're seeing increased amounts of active news avoidance around the world.” Others worry about normalising anger offline and the eroding effects on people’s trust in the content they view. “Algorithms amplify outrage, it makes people think it's more normal,” says social psychologist Dr William Brady. He adds: “What we know from certain platforms like X is that politically extreme content is actually produced by a very small fraction of the user base, but algorithms can amplify it as if they were more of a majority.” The BBC contacted the main social media platforms about rage bait on their sites, but had no responses. In October 2024, Meta executive Adam Mosseri posted on Threads about “an increase in engagement-bait"" on the platform, adding, “we’re working to get it under control.” While Elon Musk’s rival platform X, recently announced a change to its Creator Revenue Sharing Program which will see creators compensated based on engagement from the site’s premium users - such as likes, replies, and reposts. Previously compensation was based on ads viewed by premium users.  TikTok and YouTube allow users to make money from their posts or to share sponsored content too, but have rules which allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation. X does not have guidelines on misinformation in the same way. Back in Winta Zesu’s New York City apartment, the conversation – which is taking place days before the US election - turns to politics. “Yeah, I don't agree with people using rage bait for political reasons,” the content creator says. ""If they're using it genuinely to educate and inform people, it's fine. But if they're using it to spread misinformation, I totally do not agree with that. “It's not a joke anymore.”"

After a two-day hearing, Judge Christopher Lopez ruled that an auction for Infowars did not result in the best bids possible. However, he rejected Jones' claims that the auction was plagued by ""collusion."" The Onion said the bid was secured with the backing of families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, who won a $1.5bn (£1.18bn) defamation lawsuit against Jones for spreading false rumours about the massacre. Judge Lopez said the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee who ran the auction made ""a good-faith error"". Instead of quickly asking for final offers in the auction they should have encouraged more bidding between The Onion and a company affiliated with Jones' supplement-selling businesses, he said. ""This should have been opened back up, and it should have been opened back up for everybody,"" Judge Lopez said.  Jones celebrated the judge's ruling on Infowars, calling the auction process ""ridiculous"" and ""fraudulent."" ""We are deeply disappointed in today's decision,"" Ben Collins, chief executive of The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron, posted on social media. The firm will continue its efforts to buy Infowars, he added. Jones was a fringe figure broadcasting in Austin, Texas in the 1990s and later built an audience of millions with a mix of opinion, speculation and outright fabrication. The company makes most of its money through an online shop selling vitamins and other products. The company's – and Jones's – financial difficulties stem from broadcasts made after the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Twenty young children and six school staff were killed in the attack. After the killings, Jones and guests on his broadcasts repeatedly called into question whether the massacre actually occurred, floating conspiracy theories about whether the murders were faked or carried out by government agents. At one point Jones called the attack ""a giant hoax"" and in 2015 he said: ""Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured… I knew they had actors there clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids, and it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors."" Believers in the web of conspiracy theories that Jones spun harassed the families of the Sandy Hook victims, in some cases sending them pictures of their dead children or of gravestones and posting their personal information online. Some travelled to Newtown to ""investigate"", and several people have been arrested in connection with harassment of the victims. Jones later acknowledged that the killings were real and insisted his statements were covered by US free speech protections. But relatives of the victims won defamation judgements against Jones and his company over his false statements. He declared bankruptcy in 2022 as the Sandy Hook case made its way to court, and in June 2024, a judge ordered the liquidation of Jones's personal assets. This included a multimillion-dollar ranch, other properties, cars, boats and guns, in all totalling around $8.6m according to a court filing."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn8yjw11go","Trump rings bell on record stock market - but will it last?",2024-12-13,"Natalie Sherman","BBC News","Donald Trump stood on Wall Street on Thursday, a euphoric crowd of America's business elite assembled before him, and hammered the bell to kick off morning stock market trading.  The mood was celebratory. Not only had the president-elect just been named Time person of the year, but the stock market, already up strongly, has surged to new heights since his election.  For Trump, whose public appearances have been relatively sparing since his election win last month, the visit was a reminder of the high value he places on market opinion. But whether history will look back on his appearance as the well-timed heralding of another economic boom - or a death knell - remains to be seen. Trump is entering office with a US economy that is, in the recent words of America's central bank boss, Jerome Powell, the envy of many other countries, with solid growth of 2.8%, unemployment near historic lows of 4.2% and that mysterious ingredient known as ""productivity"" on a tear.  It has combined to push American stocks to record levels: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to end the year up more than 17%. The S&P 500, a bigger index made up of America's 500 largest companies, has surged 28% since January, while the Nasdaq, where tech firms have a major presence, has rallied more than 40%. Investors are hoping for more, with the Trump administration expected to loosen regulations and green-light takeovers that might have come under harsh review during President Joe Biden's administration.  At the stock exchange on Thursday,  a who's who of the business world, including Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon and Target chief Brian Cornell, had assembled. The president-elect was greeted with sustained applause and whistles, which later gave way to chants of ""USA! USA!"" His visit marked a relatively rare appearance by a sitting or former president. But analysts have warned that current highs may be difficult to sustain in the year ahead. Job creation is already slowing and price inflation is proving stubborn.  Many of Trump's priorities - including slashing government spending, erecting stiff, broad-based trade barriers and embarking on mass deportations of migrants - if enacted, could pose further challenges to growth. Though debate is ongoing about how much the president actually will do, the proposals are generating uncertainty and have the potential for significant disruption, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""The totality of the policies, if implemented to the degree that the president has articulated, I think will be problematic for the economy,"" he said.  At the stock exchange on Thursday, Trump kept his comments focused on other parts of his agenda more palatable to markets: his promises to lower taxes from 21% to 15% for businesses manufacturing in America, cut regulation and speed up government approvals. ""A nuclear power plant - I would say a week would be enough time. What do you think?"" he said, to laughter.   Similar policies, which Zandi said would be good for the corporate bottom line, if not necessarily the economy, boosted share prices significantly during Trump's first term. He cited those gains repeatedly as a sign of his administration's success, especially at the start. But the market retreated during trade wars with allies and with China - then nose-dived at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, before rapidly recovering. Ultimately, the S&P 500 gained more than 67% on his watch - a record bested by presidents Bill Clinton in the 1990s and Barack Obama during his first four years.  Under Biden, the index has risen 59% so far. Whether Trump can repeat that performance is something he has declined to predict.  The main US stock indexes closed lower on Thursday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq dipping by around 0.5%. Asked at the stock exchange what investors should be buying in anticipation of the future, Trump, somewhat uncharacteristically, demurred. ""I don't want to get into a situation where they do and we have a dip or something"", he said, then added, ""Long term, this is going to be a country like no other."" "
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8v73dkne3o","Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",2024-12-13,"MaryLou Costa","Technology Reporter","This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments. The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body. It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people. But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.  Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.  These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds. As these differences often aren’t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI. “This allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,” says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson. In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices. Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers. “To really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,"" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland. ""So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human. “Even a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results. ""You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.” Ms Macpherson adds: “[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.” Adsilico’s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients. The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies. Adsilico’s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.  It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants. Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too. Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism. Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial. Sanofi’s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process. “With a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,” says Matt Truppo, Sanofi’s global head of research platforms and computational research and development. The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds. “There is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.” Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager. He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.  ""[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.” Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.  To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks.  Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process. “A virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,” she says."

Labour has ruled out re-joining the trade bloc, but farm and food export barriers could be removed and help provided to firms with complex supply chains while European leaders want to put youth mobility back on the table. Negotiations on a new trading relationship would begin ""in the new year"", Reeves said. The Conservative Party said it ""looks like Labour's plan is to follow EU rules for nothing in return"". Following a speech to Eurogroup finance ministers in Brussels - the first given by a UK chancellor since Brexit -  Reeves repeated that the UK would not rejoin the single market and customs union or Freedom of Movement, as outlined in the Labour manifesto. But she did not rule out keeping UK laws in line with EU regulations for farm, food and goods exports, a policy known as ""dynamic alignment"". The UK has previously said it is seeking a veterinary agreement, which could mean meat, fish, dairy, and live animals face fewer checks when crossing a UK-EU border. Reeves also did not suggest that demands for an extension of a soon-to-expire fisheries deal were a barrier to a closer Brexit relationship. Extending the Brexit fisheries deal beyond 2026 is likely to be a condition for any wider reset. Meanwhile, the EU has said it would like to see a scheme for young Europeans to live and work both there and in the UK - something Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out in the past. The EU has now refined the plan as a ""Youth Experience"" scheme which Spain's economic minister Carlos Cuerpo told the BBC could be ""put on the table"" by the bloc and that the UK could benefit to as part of a ""win win"". Germany's finance minister Jorg Kukies, who met the chancellor in Brussels, said the dialogue was a ""good signal"" for better trade between the UK and the EU. ""The intensity of trade with the UK has gone down quite substantially, if I measure it against our trade partners in the world,"" he said. ""Any progress would be highly welcome."" The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which represents about 50,000 businesses, said that in order for the economy to grow ""we must export more"" but UK firms ""are struggling under huge regulatory and paperwork burdens"". Closer alignment between the UK and Europe on, for example, food standards could complicate any attempt by Britain to forge closer relations with the US on Donald Trump's re-entry into the White House in January. The President-elect has already threatened to impose tariffs of up to 20% on all  goods imported into the US. Ahead of the chancellor's speech, shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith urged her to ""jump on a plane to the US and talk to Trump about getting a US-UK trade deal done, not trying to take Britain backwards into the slow growth EU."" Carsten Brzeski, global head at financial services company ING Research, told the BBC's Today programme that European leaders ""clearly"" had an interest in working more closely with the UK government as a result of Trump's election. He said that potential tariff changes could prove a ""threat"" to European economies such as Germany, who export a great deal of goods to the US. ""It's also about Donald Trump's idea to cut taxes and do deregulation in the US. That could also make the US economy much more attractive than the EU economy and could somewhat cannibalise the growth potential of Europe,"" Mr Brzeski said. Eelco Heinen, the Dutch finance minister, described the UK as an important trade partner, but he added: ""I'm not going to renegotiate Brexit."" EU sources said that many veterans of the fractious Brexit era in the European Commission were weary of reopening talks. Labour has said it is committed to implementing post-Brexit agreements struck under the previous Tory government. These include the Windsor Framework, which covers trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But Reeves told finance ministers: ""The reset in relations is about doing what is in the best interests of our shared economies and those that depend on it. Last month, in a highly unusual move, the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said that the UK must ""rebuild relations"" with the EU. The governor has avoided commenting on Brexit because of the Bank's independence from Westminster politics. ""The impact on trade seems to be more in goods than services,"" Mr Bailey said.  ""But it underlines why we must be alert to and welcome opportunities to rebuild relations while respecting that very important decision of the British people."" The export of goods, such as in food and farming, has been impacted by new trade barriers. But services, including banking, have performed better than expected.

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c8rjd8g65ypo",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Newcastle Falcons consultant director of rugby Steve Diamond says there has already been local and international interest as regards new investment for the club. Diamond is acting on behalf of current owner Semore Kurdi in trying to bring new money in. ""I'd be denying it if I said there wasn't interest already shown from individuals who are based in the north east and globally,"" he told BBC Sport. ""The interest needs to be substantiated. But I am confident that when people see what the package is and what they are buying into, I am sure it will be desirable for the right people.""  Newcastle are ninth in the Premiership, but have won five of their past six matches in all competitions.      Diamond says that ""all options are on the table"" as regards to potential investment, whether that is a full takeover of the club or a minority stake. But with the Falcons operating on a far lower budget than the rest of the Premiership clubs, much lower than the salary cap permitted by the league, and with a smaller squad, new money would allow them to be more competitive on the field. For Diamond, tapping into being rugby union's representative across the north east should make it attractive.  ""The USP is being part of the Premiership, and potentially a part of the big European competitions,"" he said.  ""It's a great community club across from Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear and Durham.  ""It's a massive area and hundreds of players who have played international rugby have come from that area. That in itself is a lure for someone wanting to be part of a historical club like Newcastle."" 2003 England World Cup hero Jonny Wilkinson, Toby Flood and Mathew Tait are three examples of players to come through the ranks at Kingston Park. Diamond believes they can further tap into that talent, but what he wants to avoid is losing promising younger players like Guy Pepper and Phil Brantingham, who left last summer after being lured away by richer Premiership rivals. ""Once new investment comes in, that drain won't happen and a lid will be put on it,"" he added.  ""People won't be going, they'll be contracted here for longer periods of time, so they get security.""         "

A deal could create a snack food giant with combined sales of almost $50bn (£39.2bn) a year. Both Mondelez and Hershey declined to comment on the report when contacted by BBC News. In 2016, Hershey rejected a $23bn takeover offer from Mondelez. The approach is still in the preliminary stages and it is not certain that talks will lead to a deal, according to Bloomberg. Any deal would need the approval of the Hershey Trust Company, a charitable trust, that maintains voting control over the business. It has previously blocked the takeover of the firm. A merger of the two companies could bring some of the world's best-known confectionary and snack foods under one roof. Hershey is known for brands including Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  As well as owning Cadbury, Mondelez brands include Ritz crackers, Oreo biscuits and Toblerone chocolate. The packaged food industry has faced slowing growth as consumers feel the pinch from years of rising prices. Chocolate companies in particular have had to transfer costs from higher cocoa prices to their customers. Last month, Hershey cut its revenue and profit forecasts. Its chief financial officer, Steve Voskuil, said high cocoa prices will be the ""biggest source of inflation"" for the firm going forward. Another food giant, Kraft Heinz, also recently cut its annual sales and profit forecasts as customers cut back on purchases after several rounds of price rises. Some companies have looked for deals to secure new markets and boost growth. In August, confectionery giant Mars struck a deal to snap up Pringles and Pop-Tart-maker Kellanova for almost $36bn. Some analysts have forecast an increase in mergers during the upcoming Trump administration, as the president-elect is seen as more friendly towards deal making."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg3dl757w6o","Meet Karol G, Colombia's Taylor Swift",2024-12-12,"Catherine Ellis","Business reporter","We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G? While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online. That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024. This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion. So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernabéu Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year? Born in the Colombian city of Medellín in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005. Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it. While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked. She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed. Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Mañana Será Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart. Karol G's style of music is more often described as ""reggaeton"". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish. While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Rocío Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer – and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos. ""Streaming democratised the landscape,"" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world. ""Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution."" Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%. Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (£1.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this. And this year, Karol's G's Mañana Será Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.  This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Mañana Será Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist. Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event. ""There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,"" he adds. Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Español at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map. ""I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,"" she says. ""And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top. ""And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,"" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music. Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs ""Bichota"". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality. She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them. Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour. Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify. Ms Cobo says: ""She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music."" Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation. This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates. Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group. Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora. However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. ""It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,"" she says."

An updated business plan shows passenger numbers were badly hit by lockdowns and travel restrictions. Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald said ""vast amounts of public money"" had been given to the business and that the figures must be scrutinised. Airport chiefs forecast it will achieve revenues of £30.5m by 2025. The majority shareholding in the business is now a 75%-25% split between the Tees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA) and a newly formed charitable trust after operator Esken left the airport in July and handed back its share. Despite its difficulties, officials said the pandemic had provided opportunities ""which may not have otherwise materialised"" as other airports closed.  They believe the loss was in line with other airports, which they said had also received higher levels of grant support than the £10m Teesside International was loaned by the TVCA earlier this year. Their vision is to make Teesside a ""mid-sized regional airport"" with passenger numbers up from 141,000 per year to more than one million by March 2026, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.

At least 80 percent of in-flight systems on the Russian segment of the ISS had passed their expiry date, Vladimir Solovyov told state media.  He also said small cracks had been discovered that could worsen over time. Russia has often raised concerns over hardware and has suggested it could leave the ISS after 2025.  The station was built in 1998 as part of a joint project between Russia, America, Canada, Japan and several European countries and was originally designed for a 15-year lifespan.  Mr Solovyov, the chief engineer at the space company Energia, which is the leading developer of Russia's section of the ISS, said: ""Literally a day after the [in-flight] systems are fully exhausted, irreparable failures may begin."" He warned last year that much of the equipment on the station was starting to age and would soon need to be replaced. The former cosmonaut also announced that ""superficial"" cracks had been discovered on Russia's Zarya cargo module. Launched in 1998, it is one of the oldest modules of the ISS and is now primarily used for storage.  ""This is bad and suggests that the fissures will begin to spread over time,"" Mr Solovyov told the RIA news agency. In April, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov told state TV that aging metal on the station could ""lead to irreversible consequences - to catastrophe. We mustn't let that happen"". And Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said last year that structural fatigue meant the ISS would not be capable of operating beyond 2030.  Russia's space programme has been hit by a series of budget cuts and corruption scandals in recent years. Its section of the ISS has also faced a string of problems.  In July, a malfunction caused the jet thrusters on the country's Nauka research model to fire without warning, destabilising the ISS. Its Zvezda service module, which provides living quarters for ISS crew members, has also experienced several air leaks since 2019.

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63596170",NA,NA,NA,NA,"It is exactly 50 years since England and Scotland met on a chilly afternoon at Ravenscraig Stadium in Greenock for their first official women's international match. England recovered from going 2-0 down to win 3-2 and, to celebrate the anniversary, a five-part podcast called 'My Moment in History: Kicking Off the Women's Game' has been produced by the BBC. Current figures in women's football join individuals involved in that game - both players and people integral in making it happen - to speak to former England defender Anita Asante.  Here are some of the best bits... Listen to My Moment in History: Kicking off the women's game BBC Rewind: Watch Scotland v England in 1972, external One person instrumental in getting that first international off the ground was Elsie Cook, who was secretary at the Scottish Football Association before becoming manager of the national team. ""The tension in the dressing room before the game was unbelievable,"" says Cook. ""When they walked out that tunnel, I had tears in my eyes - you get very, very emotional."" Cook had faced sexism and a lack of resources as she tried to establish a women's football team in Scotland.  ""All we wanted to do was play football, to improve the game for girls. ""It didn't matter where we went, the doors were slammed in our face. Why were we ostracised? That was the male attitude in Scotland in those days. The women should be at the sink, they shouldn't be daring to pull on football boots."" Among those unhappy at her passion for football included her husband, who asked her to resign as secretary because he ""would not tolerate the idea that women played football"". He gave her an ultimatum, she recalls - ""It's either me or the football"". She travelled to Edinburgh intending to resign as the secretary... and instead they made her the manager of the Scotland team.  ""I had to go back home and tell him - you can imagine how he felt. I had to go and take the route that I intended to take. I had no option. ""It cost me my husband,"" she adds. ""I was a football suffragette, I had to prove that women could play football, simple."" Cook was heavily involved in that first match, from sewing badges on shirts to arranging the pre-match transport, although Scotland player Jean Hunter recalls not everything going to plan.  ""We were all waiting on this coach coming to pick us up. And obviously it never arrived.  ""The next thing, Elsie said 'you're all getting inside this furniture van, it's taking you to Greenock'. We thought 'this is great' - it was like an adventure."" The Ravenscraig Pioneers relive the day they made history Why was women's football banned in 1921? Flying winger Lynda Hale scored the equaliser for England in that first international to make it 2-2,  before Jeannie Allott grabbed the winner. ""We were 2-1 down and I can remember Pat Davies passing me the ball,"" says Hale. ""I went past one person, shot and it went right into the bottom right-hand corner."" At the time, she didn't realise the significance of being involved in that first match.  ""Yes, I'd played for England, but it only meant a lot to a few family members and maybe someone you worked with because women's football wasn't very big at the time,"" she said.  Hale, who won seven FA Cup titles with Southampton, says that despite the lack of recognition, some players went to extreme lengths to be able to be involved. ""I was quite lucky because from Southampton there were four players going so we all travelled together by train to London,"" she said. ""My biggest memory was Jeannie Allott - she came from Crewe and she was only 16. We got up to Waterloo and she was there and we asked how she got there and she said 'I hitchhiked, I stayed at the station all night'.  Allott says hitchhiking was a regular feature of her footballing career.  ""I always hitchhiked, whether it was for Fodens Ladies or for the England team. I always hitchhiked from Crewe to London. There was no money, I had no choice,"" she said. ""Who had money in those days? I couldn't afford a train ticket. I slept there [in a station] overnight and I thumbed it back home the next day. ""When somebody loves football as much I did - and still do - you'll do anything."" Wendy Owen won her first cap in England's second game away to France in April 1973. For the first match against Scotland, she was an 18-year-old cheering on the team from the bench. ""We went 2-0 down so I was thinking 'oh no, this is terrible, we're going to lose here',"" said Owen. ""I was a substitute and I was sat under a blanket on the bench because it was absolutely freezing cold. I've found a write-up and it says there were about 400 people there. ""The moment for me was when we scored this final goal - 3-2! - and I leapt off this bench, blanket flying in the air, and we eventually won."" Away from the pitch however, she has a less favourable memory. ""When we received our letter to say we'd been selected, it said at the hotel we were staying in girls weren't allowed to wear trousers and it was a wedding venue so they didn't want to offend any brides,"" she said. ""I didn't even own a skirt! I had to go to a shop and buy a skirt, I wasn't impressed.""  Being part of the first England team also saw them invited to Wembley as part of their preparations for a five-a-side exhibition and Owen describes their excitement at rubbing shoulders with the likes of George Best and the 1966 World Cup-winning striker Geoff Hurst.  It was also a first for the stars of the men's game.  ""They were very interested because we were the first female England team - they had never seen any female players before,"" she says. ""We didn't actually realise we were making history back then. We were just girls playing football and we were really pleased we'd been selected for England."" England honour former Lionesses in 50th anniversary celebrations Macclesfield Ladies goalkeeper Sue Whyatt, who was 16 at the time of England's first match, was the reserve keeper behind the more experienced Sue Buckett.  ""As soon as they started to play the national anthem, that was it, I had tears rolling down my face,"" recalls Whyatt, who says that ""never in my wildest dreams did I think there would be an England team - with me on it"" when she was growing up. Her goalkeeping career had started on the streets of north-west England. ""I think the lads chose me to play in goal to be fair - the lads I used to play with on the street,"" she explains.

Spending is currently set at 0.5% of national income - around £11bn. The BBC has learned that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is expected to admit there will be an overspend of £1bn or so in each of the next three years pushing aid spending to an estimated 0.55%. The Treasury said there were ""significant pressures"" on aid budgets. The department, responsible for the country's finances, has been forced to accept the increase because the Home Office has spent so much of the foreign aid budget housing and feeding refugees and asylum seekers from Ukraine, Afghanistan and others coming in boats across the Channel.  The BBC revealed last month the government was on course to spend £4bn of aid in the UK this year, more than on direct humanitarian help for countries overseas.  International rules allow governments to count the money they spend on the first year of an asylum seeker's stay in their country as official development assistance - known as ODA. But such have been the numbers coming into the UK this year that the Home Office's drain on the aid budget has risen inexorably. As a result, earlier in the summer the Foreign Office suspended all ""non-essential"" spending on humanitarian and development needs overseas, causing devastating cuts to UK aid projects all over the world. This was on top of the government's decision two years ago to cut its aid spending target from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%. The reduction was supposed to be temporary and last only until ""the fiscal situation allowed"" - which the Treasury last year forecast would be in 2024. But government sources suggest Jeremy Hunt will make clear this Thursday when he announced the Autumn Statement that there will be no return to the 0.7% target for at least three years. Nor is there expected to be any curb on Home Office use of the aid budget. Even though aid spending overseas is falling, any overall increase in the budget may prove controversial in a week when so much other government spending is expected to be cut by the Chancellor. Charities said officials in the Foreign Office had not realised how much aid was being spent by the Home Office and had not had enough time to cut other budgets to meet the 0.5% target. ""Officials just don't know what their budget is going to be,"" one source said. ""It is very, very difficult to plan."" It is also understood that The Treasury that Andrew Mitchell, the new International Development Secretary, has successfully persuaded the Treasury to protect some aid spending targeted at preventing treatable diseases.  Mr Mitchell is expected to announce on Monday just how much money the UK will contribute over the next three years to the Global Fund - the international organisation that tackles tuberculosis, HIV/Aids and malaria. Charities are hoping he will allocate at least £1bn. Three years ago the government pledged £1.4bn for that three-year period. The Treasury emphasised that the government was prioritising essential overseas aid funding and remained committed to spending 0.7% of national income on ODA once the fiscal situation allowed. In a statement, it said: ""Across government, there are significant pressures on the ODA budget due to the costs of accepting refugees from Afghanistan and Ukraine as well as wider migration challenges. We remain one of the largest global aid donors, spending more than £11bn in aid in 2021, and UK aid has recently gone towards those in need in the Horn of Africa and Pakistan.  ""All spending decisions will be considered in the round by the Chancellor at the Autumn Statement."""

The Irish carrier said the move is due to a policy change by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).  The CAA has rejected this claim.  Ryanair said the CAA introduced new regulatory barriers ahead of the end of the Brexit transition, causing ""unnecessary loss of connectivity to the UK economy"".  The airline secured an operating licence for its UK subsidiary nearly two years ago to allow it to keep UK traffic rights, including flying between domestic destinations, and protect its operations from 1 January. On Tuesday, Ryanair routes between Northern Ireland and Britain could be still be booked. City of Derry Airport told BBC News NI it is ""waiting for a further update from Ryanair post their ongoing discussions with the UK CAA, which resumed today"".  A spokesperson for Ryanair said they were disappointed 12 UK domestic and international routes had been cancelled. ""Ryanair UK had agreed Brexit contingency arrangements with the CAA two years ago and cannot comply with its new and impractical requirements at 10 days' notice,"" the spokesperson said.   ""We call on the CAA's David Kendrick and his management colleagues to respect this long-standing agreement and the CAA's own established policy in order to facilitate the return of these routes as soon as possible."" The airline operates two routes from City of Derry Airport and two from Belfast International Airport.  It is not yet clear which will be affected.  The UK aviation authority hit back at Ryanair.  In a statement published on its website, Paul Smith said: ""It is incorrect for the airline to state that the UK Civil Aviation Authority has changed its wet-leasing policy at short notice."" Wet-leasing involves an aircraft being leased along with crew, maintenance and insurance.  ""It has been our long-standing position that a UK airline with a significant presence in the UK, such as Ryanair UK does, should not rely heavily on using wet-leased, foreign-registered aircraft to undertake their operations,"" the statement continued.  ""Doing so undermines the competitiveness of the UK aviation industry and the effectiveness of the regulatory regime. This is a view shared by regulators around the world and has nothing to do with our preparations for the end of the transition period. ""The decision to cancel these flights was taken by Ryanair alone. We will continue to engage with the airline on these matter as we seek to act in the best interest of consumers."" The CAA said Ryanair has one aircraft, of its more than 470, listed on the UK's register."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/education-55022006","Coronavirus: How did your lockdown container garden grow?",2020-12-06,"Judith Burns","BBC News","Vegetable-growing was big news during the first lockdown, with people inspired to get green-fingered in the tiniest of spaces but did they produce bumper crops or snacks for snails?  ""With cooking, if it goes wrong you can try again the next night,"" says Newcastle based Mark Ridsdill Smith who runs the container gardening forum, Vertical Veg. But with growing ""you have to wait a whole year before you can go again"". In June, Sheila Brand had big ambitions for her third-floor balcony.   She had already picked raspberries, radishes and courgettes and was growing tomatoes, aubergines, herbs and even pumpkins which she hoped to harvest in October.   But then the snails arrived. ""They ate everything. There was nothing left out of all the pumpkins I had sown and grown,"" she said. She was heartbroken but will try again in the spring, although she's not sure how to ward off another ""huge invasion"". ""Right now I'm not growing much at all, just the standard herbs just outside my door for easy access while I'm cooking... ""My balcony looks very sad,"" she says. Mark's advice: There are loads of anti-snail products, but really the best way is to go out at night with a torch and spend five minutes picking them off. Alternatively, look under pots or in other shady places and remove them in daylight.  For real-ale enthusiast Colin Coyne it began when his sister gave him six pots containing tiny tomato seedlings.  His second floor flat has no outside space so they sat on his living room window sill, inside the glass, in perfect greenhouse conditions. Colin, who chairs the north London branch of the Campaign for Real Ale, made sure they were well watered. By July, the tomato plants were nearly 2m high. At night, they pushed out the curtains, by day they blocked out the light. He propped them up, at first on canes and later on strings attached to the curtain pole.    ""They grew and they grew and they grew... When you're dealing with a forest, eventually I had to cut them back,"" he says.  Despite an influx of aphids all the plants produced fruit and Colin ate a lot of tomato salad.  ""It's encouraged me to try again, I've certainly got the bug,"" he said, although next year he plans to stick to smaller plants like  basil, thyme or sage. He's also saved seeds from a chilli plant which was his other crop, although he's not convinced by the flavour: ""It nearly blew my head off,"" he says.  Mark's advice: Not all tomato plant varieties are enormous. Look for varieties labelled ""balcony"" or ""tumbling"" which might be a better fit. Herbs like basil or thyme would do very well in such a warm location. Chilli plants are a good idea but try a milder variety.  With aphids, he says, it's about managing the population. Smaller plants can be taken outside, turned upside down, tapped a few times and the aphids will jump off. Otherwise, just squish them, he says. Healthcare worker Hana Evans can see the sea from her balcony flat in Paignton, Devon, and is hoping her lettuce, rocket, kale and spinach will provide fresh greens all winter.  In the summer, she also grew several types of tomato, radishes, peas, beans, cucumbers, herbs and courgettes .  ""The plants created a true edible jungle... It's truly been my little retreat and a sanctuary of peace."" Her high-rise garden attracted ""bees and butterflies"" and ""a family of goldfinches"" which fed on seeds from the cornflowers she grew.  But packing in so much had a downside: ""The plants have been competing for space and light a bit which eventually brought in a few pests,"" and her courgettes never reached full size although they were ""delicious small"".  Mark's advice: Plant spacing is partly trial and error and it's definitely worth giving fruiting plants like courgettes a bit more room. ""I think she's done an amazing job."" Richard Chamberlain's four south-west-facing window ledges have seen prolific growth, first with kale and spring onions and then replanted with tomatoes and courgettes which are still ""steadily producing"". An experienced gardener who grew up on a fruit and veg farm in Essex, Richard's career as a business consultant has taken him to Florida and California where vegetables ""just whoosh"".  He checks on the plants at the start of each day but ""I don't talk to them,"" he says.  He would do some things differently next year.  ""The kale was OK. There were about eight plants. I made the mistake of not harvesting as soon as I should have done... ""I actually cooked some and tried to eat it but the stalks were too woody in the mouth."" Mark says: Kale varieties like cavalo nero and red Russian can be tender enough to eat uncooked, he says, but plants can become bitter or woody if they dry out. So be extra careful in hot, dry weather, particularly with small pots, which can dry out fast.  Robyn Wiles and her partner Alex improvised by using wooden pallets hung on the walls of their patio in Nottingham as planters to grow chillies, peppers, tomatoes, spring onions, and herbs. The chillies went into stir fries ""and have a surprising kick for such little things"", while the tomatoes and spring onions ""have been lovely in our lunch salads and we made fresh pesto with our basil"".  Robyn has less time for gardening now she's back working full-time as a physiotherapist but hopes to try again next year, ideally expanding from pallets into pots for more growing room.  Mark says: If you're short of time, larger containers can be a boon as they retain moisture which means missing a day's watering won't be a disaster.  Also, think about perennial, rather than annual plants. Unlikely perennials for containers include blackberries and blueberries and ""you can get a purple raspberry that does well"", plus oregano or sage and more unusual herbs like lovage or savory. Mark even has a container-grown apple tree, which produces about 100 apples each year. His main advice when things go wrong is not to lose heart and to accept that learning might be slow.  ""A little bit of the right information can make all the difference. ""When I started off I had loads of things go wrong, loads of disasters but it's all part of the fun."" "

In a report this week, the US space agency said the ISS would crash into a part of the ocean known as Point Nemo. This is the point furthest from land on planet Earth, also known as the spacecraft cemetery. Many old satellites and other space debris have crashed there, including the Russian space station Mir in 2001. Nasa said that in the future space activities close to Earth would be led by the commercial sector.  The ISS - a joint project involving five space agencies - has been in orbit since 1998 and has been continuously crewed since 2000. More than 3,000 research investigations have taken place in its microgravity laboratory.  However, it is only approved to operate until 2024 and any extension must be agreed by all partners.  Nasa said the plan to retire the ISS marked a transition to the commercial sector for activities in low-Earth orbit - the area of space close to Earth.  ""The private sector is technically and financially capable of developing and operating commercial low-Earth orbit destinations, with Nasa's assistance,"" said Phil McAlister, director of commercial space at Nasa Headquarters. In 2020, Nasa awarded a contract to Texas-based company Axiom Space to build at least one habitable module to be attached to the ISS. It has also provided funding to three companies to develop designs for space stations and other commercial destinations in orbit.  It is hoped that these new projects will be in at least partial operation before the ISS is retired.  Nasa said it wanted to create a ""robust, American-led commercial economy in low-Earth orbit"". The commercial sector is already an important part of the US space programme, with private companies responsible for delivering crew and cargo. Russia's Soyuz and Progress spacecraft are also used.  According to Nasa, it will save $1.3bn (£956m) by transitioning to the private sector for activities in low-Earth orbit, money which instead can be spent on deep-space exploration. The savings are anticipated because Nasa will only be paying for the services it needs, rather than for the maintenance and operations of the ISS. Nasa also points out that the private sector space stations will be newer and should require fewer spare parts.  Nasa said it had analysed its ISS budget on an annual basis and that it would continue to refine its savings estimates.  The transition report published by Nasa this week comes after the administration of US President Joe Biden said it had committed to extend the space station's activities until 2030.  However, the extension still requires the support of international partners, including Russia, and funding for the ISS is currently only approved by US Congress until 2024.  In an interview with the Russian news agency Interfax in December 2021, the head of Russia's space programme, Dmitry Rogozin, indicated a willingness to work with Nasa beyond 2024.  ""Actions speak louder than words,"" he said. ""This year we sent a new Nauka module to the ISS, which is expected to last at least 10 years."" The head of Roscosmos also complained that US sanctions on Russia were hurting the Russian space industry, and he has previously said Russia could end its participation in the ISS programme if the sanctions are not lifted. The US and its Western partners have threatened further sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine, although the exact nature of those sanctions is not yet known.  Russia has previously said that structural fatigue meant the ISS would not be capable of working beyond 2030, and warned that outdated equipment could lead to ""irreparable"" failures."

It paves the way for his return to Ivory Coast, where he remains an influential figure.  He had been charged in connection with violence following a disputed election in 2010 that left 3,000 people dead. The first former head of state to go on trial at the ICC, he had denied all the allegations over the bloodshed. This case was seen as a test of the institution's ability to handle high-profile figures, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports from The Hague.  Mr Gbagbo, 75, gave the thumbs up at the war crimes court in The Hague after the ruling, the AFP news agency reports. His supporters gathered on the grass outside the court were jubilant. In Ivory Coast there was dancing and singing in a pro-Gbagbo suburb of the main city of Abidjan. ""We say that the whole of Africa has just been liberated today.... That is why we have gone crazy. This day will remain engraved in our memories,"" supporter Jean Gossé told AFP. The former president was in court alongside ally and former youth leader Charles Blé Goudé, who was accused of leading a militia backing him. They were both acquitted in 2019, but the prosecution had appealed what was seen as the shock decision to clear them. It argued that there were procedural errors in how the original verdict was delivered and insisted that thousands of documents and 96 witnesses presented during the trial had proved their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. But presiding Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji said: ""The appeals chamber, by majority, has found no error that could have materially affected the decision of the trial chamber. ""The appeals chamber hereby revokes all remaining conditions on the release of Mr Gbagbo and Mr Blé Goudé as a result of this judgement."" Mr Gbagbo has been living in the Belgian capital Brussels since his release from detention two years ago. Back home in November 2019, he was sentenced in absentia for the ""looting"" of the Central Bank of West African States (Bceao) in the aftermath of the disputed poll - and in theory he could be jailed on his return and it meant he was barred from being a candidate in last year's election. His successor and erstwhile rival, President Alassane Ouattara, has invited him to return to Ivory Coast, which is still striving for political stability. Issiaka Diaby, the president of an association for civil war victims, told the Reuters news agency: ""We are against this decision of the ICC because the victims were forgotten."" The violence in Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer, came after Mr Gbagbo refused to accept that he had lost a disputed election run-off to Mr Ouattara in 2010. The five months of violence that followed were described as some of the most brutal clashes the country had ever seen.  During the political stand-off there were bloody clashes and targeted killings in Abidjan in the south, and several hundred were massacred in the western town of Duékoué. Prosecutors said Mr Gbagbo clung to power ""by all means"" and charged him with four counts of crimes against humanity, murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and ""other inhuman acts"".  The former president, who was captured in April 2011 hiding in a presidential palace bunker, said the charges were politically motivated. Whenever a case collapses at the ICC, it damages the perception of the court as a credible tool of international justice, our reporter says. The appeals judges agreed that the evidence in this case was extremely weak, raising questions about how this trial went as far as it did, she says. It is not the first case that has collapsed at the ICC. The court's outgoing prosecutor Fatou Bensouda lost an appeal in 2018 against the acquittal of Jean-Pierre Bemba, former vice-president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who had been charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also saw charges of crimes against humanity over post-election violence dropped by Ms Bensouda in 2014. The prosecution accused the government of failing to hand over vital evidence and said efforts had also been hampered by an unprecedented effort to intimidate and interfere with witnesses. Ms Bensouda said Wednesday's judgement would be analysed to ""fully appreciate its rationale and import for our work"", and added that the investigations into alleged war crimes in Ivory Coast would continue."

Figures from the force show in 2018 there were 351 officers authorised to carry the weapon, while in 2022 there are 1,031. Some special constables in Kent are now carrying Tasers. In March, Kent's chief constable Alan Pughsley said an increase was partly due to the number of attacks on officers. A BBC Freedom of Information request revealed between April 2021 and August 2022 Tasers were deployed in Kent 887 times, being fired 806 times. The youngest person at which a Taser was fired between 2018 and 2022 was 13, although the force said one was drawn and aimed at a boy aged 12. Ch Supt Tracey Quiller said: ""Very young teenagers and pre-teens are presenting weapons. ""A knife, a machete, could be fatal to members of the public and the officer would take all of that into account in deciding how they were going to resolve that situation."" One of the volunteer officers trained to carry a Taser, Scott Dawson, said: ""We go to the same incidents, the same jobs, as our regular counterparts and we face the same level of threat. ""Being able to carry a Taser reassures us we're provided with a piece of kit that can keep ourselves safe."" But Oliver Feeley-Sprague, Amnesty International UK's policing expert, is concerned about the increasing numbers being carried. ""It's becoming less about a specialist tool to be used as an alternative to shooting someone dead,"" said Mr Feeley-Sprague, who is also involved with an advisory group to the National Police Chiefs' Council. He said a Taser was now more ""a piece of kit that's about keeping officers safe"", adding: ""That raises a concern about the weapon being used more and more frequently for less and less appropriate circumstances.""

Sian Hurley originally from Morpeth, flew from Brisbane, Australia, to Newcastle upon Tyne with her family - via London - on 20 June. While the luggage made the connection, the bike went missing at Heathrow's Terminal 2 for a week. It arrived at Newcastle Airport just in time for the event Ms Hurley has spent a year training for. Ms Hurley said: ""It's brilliant to have my bike returned, I've been out this morning and being back on it was like putting on my shoes. ""The staff at Newcastle Airport were lovely, I got reassurances that BA were sorting it and while it's very disappointing it took so long to get it back I'm very glad to have it."" The bike has arrived days before the 40-year-old travels to Bolton to compete in the Ironman UK competition, which will see her swim 2.4 miles, cycle 112 miles and run a marathon. The mother of two has spent the past 12 months training for the event at home in Brisbane where she works full time as an intensive care nurse. She said her regime changed daily, but included 3km swims, cycling for up to four fours and running for two hours.  ""I feel fresh and good ahead of the event but the stress hasn't helped,"" she said. ""A friend loaned me a bike to train on while I was staying in Morpeth and although I'm grateful, it wasn't the same as my bike which was specially fitted for me. But now I've got it back I'm feeling positive and relieved."" British Airways staff located the bike at Heathrow's Terminal 2 on Monday and put it on a flight to Newcastle. A technical malfunction at the terminal on 17 June had led to hundreds of bags piling up at Heathrow. Ms Hurley, who had tagged her bike, knew it was among the pile of luggage but was unable to find anyone to speak to about how to get it returned. She said: ""That was the most frustrating part - I couldn't get to talk to anyone at Heathrow's baggage hall, every time I called I got put through to a customer centre which was miles away from the airport. ""I still haven't spoken to anyone at BA or Malaysia Airlines - the first I knew about it was returning to my family home in Morpeth after a few hours out and - seeing my mum crying - I knew then my bike had been found."" Ms Hurley said she was hoping for a top-five finish in her age category.  She took part in the same challenge in 2013 when she was placed fastest in her age for cycling. She has previously competed in six Ironman events in the past, including the World Championships in Hawaii in 2014, and set herself the goal of doing another after having her daughters, to be a role-model for them.

Under Morgan, England won the World Cup in 2019 and reached the top of the one-day and Twenty20 rankings. In the Netherlands, he made two ducks before missing the final one-day international with a groin injury. ""The day it hit me was quite a sad day,"" the 35-year-old said.  ""I've engaged with a lot of ex-players as to how they've stopped, and when and how the transition worked, and each person said there is a time and place where it hits you,"" added Morgan. ""And the other common answer was you'll wake up and you'll know. That moment came for me in Amsterdam. ""Since then I've been incredibly proud and content with the decision and excited for English cricket going forward."" 'Morgan retires an immortal of English sport' TMS podcast: Morgan retires from international cricket Jos Buttler, who has led England in nine ODIs and five T20s when Morgan has been absent through injury, is expected to take on the role, with an announcement set for later in the week. England face India in a three-match T20 series starting on 7 July, and the T20 World Cup in Australia begins in October. Morgan took charge of the T20 side in 2012 and one-day side in 2014 and was also part of the 2010 T20 World Cup-winning side. He is England's leading run-scorer in one-day and T20 cricket with 6,957 and 2,458 runs respectively. Morgan's tally of 225 ODIs and 115 T20s is also an England record, but his two ducks against the Netherlands came at the end of a run of one half-century in 26 white-ball innings. He added: ""To call time on what has been without doubt the most enjoyable and rewarding chapter of my career hasn't been an easy decision, but I believe now is the right time to do so, both for me, personally, and for both England white-ball sides I have led to this point. ""It is a culmination of a lot of things that over the course of the international career, which has been a long time, I've just come to the end.  ""I'm glad I was in a sound enough space to understand that feeling and be well aware of what it meant and what it means both for the England white-ball sides and myself in my personal life."" Morgan said he would ""continue to enjoy playing at a domestic level while I can"" and still plans to captain London Spirit in the second season of The Hundred in August.  Asked about a possible involvement in the England coaching set-up, he added: ""At the moment the best thing for the set-up is for me to come out of it and let a new captain find his feet and build a relationship with the new coach and ultimately drive towards the next World Cups. ""I have certainly not ruled out coaching."" After overseeing England's miserable 2015 World Cup campaign when they were knocked out in the group stages, Morgan implemented a new, attacking approach which helped his side break the record for the highest one-day total three times. Rob Key, managing director of England men's cricket, said: ""It will be wrong to think Eoin's legacy was just winning the World Cup in 2019 - it is far greater than that. ""As with all great players and leaders, he has changed the way the game has been played, and he has changed the way an entire generation and generations to come will play this form of the game.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-53186916","Scott Bessant: Ex-Wales Dragonhearts player dies aged 37",2020-06-25,NA,NA,"A former rugby league international has died, almost three years after being found in a lane with a fractured skull. Scott Bessant, who played for Wales Dragonhearts, died in hospital. The 37-year-old suffered brain damage after being found unconscious next to a bridge in Pentwyn, Torfaen, in August 2017. He had a fractured skull, neck and fractured pelvis and broken ribs. After fears the father-of-two had contracted coronavirus, he died following complications from pneumonia. A keen rugby player from school, Bessant started in the union code and played for Pill Harriers in Newport before signing with Pontypool in 2006. He started playing rugby league for Newport Titans RLFC a year after that, helping to lead the club to the 2007 Welsh Grand Final, which they lost 24-18 to Bridgend Blue Bulls. In 2008 he won the first of his six Wales Dragonhearts caps, scoring a try in the 62-20 win over Scotland Bravehearts in Glasgow. He followed that up with another try in the 32-24 win over Ireland Wolfhounds in Porthcawl to help lead Wales' community international side to the Four Nations Championship. He then moved to Torfaen Tigers RLFC, before turning to rugby league coaching as a 30-year old, taking charge of Newport and then Torfaen. In a statement, Wales Rugby League said: ""For over 950 days, Scott's parents, Howard and Jackie, didn't missed a day in visiting their son, until everything went on lockdown. ""Scott was due to eventually live with his sister Rachael, whose home was in the process of being adapted for his complex needs. ""Everyone at Wales Rugby League sends their sincere condolences to Scott's family and his multitude of friends."""
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56449233",NA,NA,NA,NA,"""I want life experiences and to do that you have to push yourself out of your comfort zone - and this certainly did."" Ben Pugh was in his late twenties and coaching in the Ipswich Town academy when an opportunity off the beaten football track piqued his interest. Though the Cayman Islands were ranked 206th out of 210 countries in the Fifa rankings and had not won an international in nine years, there was enough to lure him 5,000 miles across the world to take the job as head coach. Almost two years - and four victories - later, Pugh is embarking on his maiden World Cup qualification campaign and preparing to face a Champions League winner. Pugh started his coaching journey aged 16 in the Suffolk village of Shotley, helping out at his brother's under-eights team after ""coming to the realisation"" that he would never make it as a player. A sports science degree led to him initially volunteering at Ipswich, coaching pre-academy children, with his role growing over eight years to working with players up to the age of 16 at Portman Road. ""Seeing how [former Ipswich manager] Mick McCarthy and [assistant] Terry Connor went about dealing with people was brilliant,"" Pugh told BBC Radio Suffolk. ""Whether you worked as a coach in the youth age groups, whether you were a senior team player or one of the chefs, they'd treat everybody the same and from a personal level their values certainly rubbed off on me."" When a couple players from the Cayman Islands came over to train for a week at the then Championship club, Pugh built relationships - and then the job came up. ""It probably wasn't as prestigious as the job I had at Ipswich, but I wanted to try something different, I wanted to have a life experience and I thought even if it didn't work out it would be an incredible experience,"" he said. Since taking charge in July 2019, Pugh has steered the British Overseas Territory to victories over Barbados, Saint Martin and the US Virgin Islands in the Concacaf Nations League, only missing out on promotion on goal difference. Not bad for an island of about 65,000 people and whose only professional player plies his trade in Romania's third division. ""Because it's such a small island, people here play with their friends and everybody knows each other - it's not like England where you pull in people who live five or six hours apart,"" said Pugh. ""We have a really good young core of players here that are hungry and the programme probably just needed a little bit more structure, which I tried to add, and that little bit more professionalism that I'd seen back home."" The challenge ahead for Pugh's Cayman Islands is enormous, but the pressure is anything but. In the first round of qualifying for next winter's World Cup, the minnows have been drawn against Suriname, Bermuda, Aruba and 73rd-ranked Canada, who boast Bayern Munich's marauding full-back Alphonso Davies in their ranks. ""It's fantastic for me and more so for the players,"" continued Pugh. ""These are opportunities that they maybe never would've dreamed of, or maybe will never get again - to play against Alphonso Davies, a Champions League winner who's played at the highest level. ""Are we going to qualify for the World Cup? Absolutely not. The teams we're facing are incredibly good with world-class players, but if we can make small strides forward then maybe qualifying for a Gold Cup is a possible goal."" Pugh is realistic for good reason - while the Cayman Islands have risen to 193rd in the world under his stewardship, the country has never won a World Cup qualifying match and would have to come through three rounds, overcoming the likes of Mexico and the United States, to reach the finals in Qatar. Just fulfilling the fixtures is hard enough, even though the island is free of coronavirus, as all players and staff have to quarantine for 14 days on returning from overseas. ""Trying to convince employers to let players out of work for nearly 25 days is proving to be a challenge but we're fortunate that most are proud to let their employee go and play in these games and represent their country,"" he said. Asked what advice he would give to young coaches hoping to land such an international role, Pugh is clear. ""Take risks,"" he said. ""I was in a good job at Ipswich and I took that risk, hoping that something would build from that and I'm fortunate that it did. ""It's given me experiences that I maybe wouldn't have had if I'd not taken the risk and stayed back in Ipswich."" Although leaving the Suffolk town has proved fruitful career-wise, it still forms a big part of Pugh's future ambitions. ""On a personal level I'd like to coach at the highest level, but where that will be and what country I'm not sure,"" he added. ""I'd love to be Ipswich manager one day - whether that will happen, time will tell."" Ben Pugh was speaking to BBC Radio Suffolk's Connor Bennett."

The vehicle is expected to help usher in a new era of private ""taxi services"" operating just above the Earth. When the space shuttle was retired in 2011, Nasa became reliant on Russia for transporting its astronauts to the ISS. In the meantime, Nasa worked on handing this job over to US companies. The space agency chose Boeing and SpaceX to develop new vehicles with the intention of purchasing seats on them for its crew once they started flying. Starliner has an Apollo-like design with conical sides - a shape that's stable when the capsule is plummeting at high speed through the Earth's atmosphere. But it has more autonomy than either the Apollo spacecraft or the shuttle. Boeing's vehicle travels to the ISS and docks with little to no intervention from astronauts. It's also designed to be safer. Unlike the space shuttle, Starliner has an escape system that can propel the crew away from its rocket if an emergency occurs during launch. The spacecraft's full name is Starliner CST-100. ""CST"" stands for Crew Space Transportation and ""100"" refers to the Kármán line, the official boundary of space, 100km above the Earth.  The vehicle comes in two main parts, which are attached to each other from launch until shortly before re-entry:  The internal core of the crew module is called the pressure vessel and is manufactured in two halves. Each half is made from a single piece of metal, rather than from different pieces welded together. Eliminating welds reduces the chance of defects that could weaken the structure. After the two halves of the vessel are sealed together, the sloping sides are enclosed within a protective envelope called the backshell. Blankets made of silica and woven glass cover the outside, but areas that receive more heating on re-entry are shielded with ceramic tiles like those used on the space shuttle. The crew module measures 4.6m at its base, with a cabin that accommodates up to seven crew. Nasa missions will take between four and five passengers per flight, swapping the seats for extra cargo storage. If the fifth seat is vacant, Boeing has the option to sell it to a space tourist or carry an astronaut from another country. The control console has two display screens. While SpaceX opted for touchscreens in its Crew Dragon vehicle, Boeing went for the traditional approach of switches and buttons.  Because most spacecraft operations are automated, crew members won't have to engage much with the vehicle. But if, for any reason, they have to assume manual control, the traditional layout gives them everything they need to fly the ship. Former Nasa astronaut Christopher Ferguson, who now works for Boeing, played an instrumental role in Starliner's design. ""To become a part of that was just very compelling. I couldn't give that up for any other opportunity that's out there,"" Ferguson explained. During lift-off, ascent and re-entry, crew members wear the ""Boeing Blue"" flight suit, designed to protect them from a depressurisation event, in which air is lost from the capsule. The company says it is 40% lighter and more flexible than earlier generations of spacesuit. The shoes are more like cross trainers than heavy boots and the gloves are touchscreen-sensitive, so the crew can use tablet computers during flight.  Unlike other designs, this one features a flexible hood and visor instead of a hard helmet. The idea was prompted by Ferguson's experience of returning to Earth in the bulky suits used on the shuttle. After two weeks in microgravity, Ferguson said the metal ring where the helmet attached would push down on his shoulders, causing them to ache.  Starliner can ride one of several rockets to orbit, but will use a modified Atlas V for its first few flights. The 58m-tall Atlas is one of the most reliable rockets available and launches from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. About 31 minutes after lift-off, Starliner - having now separated from the upper stage of its rocket - fires four thrusters to put itself in the right orbit. It then embarks on a 24-hour orbital ""chase"" to catch up with the space station for rendezvous and docking. After spotting the ISS as a bright point of light with its onboard cameras, Starliner manoeuvres closer to the orbiting outpost. It pauses outside a 200m ""keep-out sphere"" until flight controllers clear it to begin the autonomous docking process. The onboard computers analyse data from sensors on the outside of the craft. The information informs an intricate orbital ballet that occurs as hundreds of finely tuned thruster firings guide Starliner into dock. Starliner is designed to stay in orbit for around seven months. After separating from the ISS, the spacecraft fires its thrusters over the Pacific Ocean to begin the process of returning to Earth. The crew module separates from the service module in preparation for the plunge through the atmosphere. During the fiery return, the heatshield covering the base of the capsule is exposed to temperatures of up to 1,650C (3,000F). The shield is made from an ""ablative"" material that slowly sinters away to carry off much of this extreme heat. According to Boeing engineer Tori Wills Pedrotty: ""The ablative is only a couple of inches thick, and at the outside, during re-entry, it's 3,000F. Two or three inches [further in], it's only 300F.  ""So we're able to convert that heat and dissipate it out, so that the astronauts inside - after only a couple more layers of insulation - sit at a balmy 75 degrees."" At around 9km (30,000ft) above the ground, two drogue parachutes are deployed to begin slowing and stabilising the capsule.  The capsule's three main parachutes then open. At an altitude of about 900m (3,000ft), the landing airbags inflate. These provide the final bit of cushioning to protect astronauts when the spacecraft touches down at one of five designated sites across the western US.  Starliner will be the first US orbital capsule to parachute on to land, rather than the ocean. Boeing says it's quicker and cheaper to refurbish a spacecraft if it hasn't been immersed in salt water. Each spacecraft can be re-used up to 10 times, with a six-month turnaround time. Follow Paul on Twitter."

The Chinese media has a different take and hopes Mr Johnson's successor Jeremy Hunt will become China's ""son-in-law"" because his wife was born there. France's conservative Le Figaro sees Theresa May ""destabilised by the pro-Brexit rebellion"", in particular by the ""sensational"" departure of Boris Johnson. ""It smashes the hard-won Brexit compromise plan to pieces,"" writes London correspondent Florentin Collomp. ""The knives are out in the alleys of Westminster, where the summer promises to be hot"" for the prime minister, he warns.  Philippe Bernard of the centre-left Le Monde is not so sure whether Mr Johnson's resignation means ""the beginning of the end for Theresa May... or the beginning of the end of her worries"". He says that after two years of ""futile skirmishes on Brexit, the boil has finally been lanced"" by Mrs May's shift towards keeping close ties with the EU.  German commentators can't help drawing World Cup parallels, none more blatant that centre-left Spiegel Online's comparison of the prime minister to England manager Gareth Southgate. ""They both want to win game after game, but the difference is that while Southgate has yet to get through the semi-finals, May's final game has already begun,"" writes correspondent Joerg Schindler. He expects hardline Tory Brexiteer MPs to see Boris Johnson's resignation as a ""signal to revolt"" against the prime minister's leadership. ""It will be no consolation if Britain wins another penalty shoot-out, as EU statutes do not provide for extra time over Brexit,"" Spiegel concludes.   In Berlin's liberal Der Tagesspiegel, Albrecht Meier also predicts a ""revolt in Westminster"" after Boris Johnson's resignation, adding that ""the prime minister must fear for her job"". As for the EU negotiators in Brussels, they have ""no choice but to wait for the outcome of the political drama in London. There will not be much time left for the negotiations in Brussels... as both sides are still far from the final goal,"" he writes.  Dominic Johnson, the foreign editor of the left-wing Tageszeitung, says the breach between Mrs May and the two departing ministers is ""not just about Brexit, but also about loyalty, cabinet discipline, and work ethic"".  He dubs Boris Johnson a ""scatterbrain ever since he took office two years ago, while David Davis has had only four hours of talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier this year, and has played no active role since March"".  Spanish papers focus on the probable delays to the talks in Brussels,  Barcelona's La Vanguardia sees Mrs May ""walking a tightrope"" in the ""worst crisis of her government"".  ""Brussels is still waiting for the umpteenth British proposal, while time and patience are running out,"" it warns.  The EU correspondent of centre-right El Mundo says Boris Johnson's departure is no great loss to diplomacy.  ""A chatterbox with exaggerated ambitions that drove nearly the world mad,"" writes Pablo R. Suanzes, who notes that the foreign secretary chose to quit ""in the week when a British citizen died of nerve-agent poisoning, and a couple of days ahead of an important Nato summit and the Trump visit"". ""David Davis was almost irrelevant, but Johnson was a time bomb,"" he concludes.  The Dutch centre-left daily De Volkskrant has little comfort for the prime minister, saying the ""chaos in the British cabinet is complete"".  Its correspondent Patrick van IJsendoorn says the ""Brexiteers' dying dream threatens to turn into a nightmare for Theresa May"".  In the eurosceptic press camp, Hungary's Magyar Idok harks back to the joke in the 1980s BBC comedy Yes Minister that Britain only joined the EU in order to thwart Franco-German co-operation, adding that this has ""come back to haunt Europe"". Its editorial says ""the British are right to object to the increased central power of Brussels"", but warns that ""some kind of free trade agreement and access to the single market will, in spite of visceral objections, be unavoidable."" Mikhail Ozerov, the London correspondent of the pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda wonders ""who the US president is going to talk to when he arrives in the next few days?""  The ""infamous, unpredictable, even scandalous"" Boris Johnson has gone, and this leaves Mrs May a ""lame duck"", he declares. As for the ""more positive foreign policy towards Russia"" that several commentators hope for, Mr Ozerov deems this ""highly unlikely, alas, given the current line-up on the British Mount Olympus"".  Russia's government daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta reserves judgement on whether Moscow can now expect an easier ride from Britain, but agrees that Mrs May ""barely holds sway, and has lost control over her cabinet""  Pundit Elena Ananyeva warns the RBC business daily that the resignations do not mean that Theresa May can continue her ""tilt toward a soft Brexit"", as she still has to face a ""good many supporters of the hard option"" in her cabinet and parliamentary party.  Boris Johnson's resignation is big news in the Iranian media, and the consensus across the political spectrum is that it spells trouble for Theresa May. The official Channel 1 TV news says it has ""put the British government on the brink of collapse"". The pro-reform newspaper Ebtekar says the two resignations ""have deepened divisions"" in the cabinet, and the Donya-e Eqtesad financial daily describes a ""resignation tsunami."" China's state media generally note that the resignations come at a time when, as the Xinhua news agency says, ""time is running out"" for Brexit negotiations. But some reports are more interested in what new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt's China-born wife Lucia Guo could mean for relations. Jeremy Hunt is a ""Chinese son-in law"", declares the Global Times daily, while the Guancha news site is proud to announce that the ""Chinese son-in-law has come to the rescue"".

The aid budget has been reduced from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income - a difference of about £4bn. The Independent Commission on Aid Impact said some cuts in funding for research on development had been made ""without consultation"". But the government says the reductions are temporary and necessary. And the Foreign Office told the BBC it was committed to full transparency over spending on aid. Ministers decided last year to cut spending on overseas development, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak arguing that it was hard to justify at existing levels, as the UK economy piled up record peacetime borrowing as a result of the pandemic. But charities, Labour and many Tory MPs have spoken out against the move, which went against the pledge in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto to stick to the 0.7% figure. In its report, the commission said cuts to the Newton Fund - which builds research partnerships with countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America - had been made ""without consultation"" and ""little openness"". It said the Foreign Office's responses to its own previous advice had been ""inadequate"", while there had been a ""reduction in transparency and openness"". The commission also criticised the government's handling of its requests for information, adding that strategy papers that had not been signed off by ministers ""were generally not shared"", unlike in previous years.  The Foreign Office took on responsibility for aid after the Department for International Development (DfID) closed last year. It said it had been transparent throughout over the budget changes. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has previously said merging DfID into the Foreign Office will ""strengthen further transparency and accountability in the use of taxpayers' money and relentlessly focus our Global Britain strategy on policies and in areas that deliver the most value""."

Foreign undergraduates - whose tuition fees are uncapped - told the BBC their university experience had been severely affected by travel bans. They said online lectures did not replace live teaching, and did not feel like good value for the money paid. The government said universities should maintain the quality and quantity of tuition. Student groups across the country have blamed government guidelines for a ""severe"" impact on their university experience. A petition on behalf of international students in the UK says virtual teaching ""is failing"" and rule-changes relating to international travel were grounds for compensation. ""Many of us left before Christmas, thinking we'd be home in Leeds in January,"" international relations student Freja Ellefsen said. She lives in Belgium and moved to Yorkshire to study at the University of Leeds. She went home at Christmas but international travel restrictions have stopped her from returning. ""Now we have all of our things there, we're still paying rent. Half of our online teaching was OK, but now we're really starting to feel the effect. ""International students aren't just there for the study experience, they're also there for the cultural experience and they're missing that too."" International students usually pay more in tuition fees when compared with their English counterparts, whose undergraduate fees are capped at £9,250 a year. Those from abroad can pay more than double this figure. Muhammad Moeen Ud Din Bhatti, from Pakistan, pays £17,500 a year to study politics, philosophy and economics at the University of York. ""Is it worth it coming to a UK university and studying over here an online course which obviously they could study anywhere in the world from any other university?"" he said. Bernadette Hsiao's £19,000-a-year journalism course at the University of Sheffield is a mixture of practical work and written assignments. She opted not to travel home to Taiwan when international travel restrictions were brought in, and chose to stay in her student accommodation. The university boasts state-of-the-art broadcast studios, but Bernadette says coronavirus restrictions have stopped students being able to use them. She said: ""Mostly I'm staying in my room and I don't get the practical experience that my course needs to be. ""I really don't think we pay this much [to] deserve this little. I know a lot of universities work very hard to make sure online lessons go well, but it just still is not the standard."" Since the start of the pandemic, many courses have moved online with students taking part in lectures on video services like Zoom. Students who moved to university towns and cities are also paying rent for accommodation they might not be using because they don't have to live near their education provider. Some moved back home and study remotely, while others, like Bernadette, spend most of their time in their rooms because social activities are cancelled due to the lockdown. Elsewhere, a university has been ordered to pay a student £5,000 in compensation for lost teaching time, according to a complaints watchdog. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator said students had complained about disrupted learning, accommodation and missed practical elements of courses. The government said the Office for Students was monitoring online teaching to ensure the quality of tuition remained high. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""From the very start of this pandemic, our priority has been protecting the education and wellbeing of all of our students, including international students, so that they can continue with their studies and graduate as planned."" It added face-to-face teaching would return when it was safe to do so. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67105143","Brexit: 'Call us' on trade, says German finance minister Christian Lindner",2023-10-13,"Faisal Islam","Economics editor","The German finance minister has extended a surprise invite to the UK to take ""new steps"" on post-Brexit trade relations with the European Union (EU). In a BBC interview, Christian Lindner said: ""If you want to intensify your trade relationship with the EU - call us!"" A government spokesperson said the UK was open to ""new opportunities"" across the globe. Mr Lindner also said the German economy and energy supplies remain strong. He is the leader of the German liberals, part of the ruling coalition led by the centre-left SPD of Chancellor Olaf Scholz. During the discussion on the margins of the IMF and World Bank's annual meetings in Marrakech, Mr Lindner said that the UK had a ""standing invitation"" on future talks aimed at reducing trade barriers, or ""obstacles in daily business life"" that had arisen. ""In the daily life of German corporates, there are new obstacles since Brexit... I don't think [the] United Kingdom is benefiting from Brexit,"" he told BBC News. ""We really appreciate the United Kingdom and its values, its people... and I would really, really appreciate it if we can intensify [the trade relationship] again,"" he added. According to the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, German goods exports to the UK were 14.1% less in 2022 than in 2016 - the year of the Brexit referendum. The UK slipped from third most important export partner to eighth. Combining trade both ways, the UK is no longer in the top 10 of German trade partners. Car exports from the EU to the UK have nearly halved in number since Brexit, falling by €10bn (£8.6bn) in value.  German and British industry has complained about extra red tape - not just for goods exports but also for worker travel. One of the most immediate new trade barriers could be an imminent imposition of tariffs on the trade of some electric vehicles, which do not qualify for the post-Brexit Trade and Co-operation Agreement with the EU. Asked if he could help solve the issue, which is also a concern for German carmakers, Mr Lindner said that the UK is now a third party country.  This refers to any country outside the EU, and in this case outside its economic structures - the single market and the customs union. Businesses in a third country have to fill in customs declarations, for example, when they import from and export to the EU - whether there is a trade agreement or not. Mr Lindner said: ""And so, if [the] United Kingdom decides for a special relationship with the European Union and our single market, you are invited... But at the moment, the United Kingdom decided for its own way and so these are these obstacles in the daily life. I regret it"". A decision on the tariffs is expected by the end of the year. Mr Lindner also held meetings with his UK counterpart, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, in Morocco.  Conversations about reducing post-Brexit red tape could be seen as a fruit of the calmer relationship with the EU since the prime minister's Windsor Agreement over Northern Ireland trade rules.  Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer is known to have developed a close working relationship with Chancellor Scholz, and now openly advocates renegotiating the Brexit deal to make it work. A scheduled review of the post-Brexit deal is due in 2026, but Mr Lindner's offer suggests that Germany is willing to move more quickly. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""The Trade and Cooperation Agreement is the world's largest zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal. It secures the UK market access across key service sectors and opens new opportunities for UK businesses across the globe."" They added that both the UK and EU have ""publicly committed"" to maximising the opportunities of that agreement. Speaking more broadly about the German economy, Mr Lindner denied it was in weak shape. ""The German economy proved its resilience,"" he said. Germany entered recession earlier this year, as its industry was hit with the consequences of the surge in gas prices and the cut-off of Russian supplies following the invasion of Ukraine. But he said Germany could reassure its European allies that it has diversified its energy supplies and filled up stores of gas, and had ""solved the problem"" of Russian gas imports."

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/20397113",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rob Earnshaw admits playing football in Tel Aviv during the current Middle East crisis has been ""scary"". Earnshaw joined Israeli side Maccabi Tel Aviv on loan in September until the end of the season. The 58-times capped Welsh international has revealed he has been training with missiles being destroyed overhead by Israel's Iron Dome missile shield. ""It's missiles in the city and that is scary,"" said Earnshaw.  More than 100 people have died in the Gaza Strip in six days of violence, Hamas officials say, with talks over a ceasefire ongoing to prevent more bloodshed. Hamas militants fired more than 100 rockets at Israel on Monday. Three Israelis have also died as a result of rocket attacks. Earnshaw gives a revealing insight into life in Israel during the current bombardment.  His two-year-old son and his sister were on holiday with him when the air strikes on Tel Aviv began. They have now returned to the UK. He revealed he had to flee his car as he made his way to watch his side's away tie with local rivals Bnei Yehuda. ""They say virtually every missile thrown into Tel Aviv is intercepted, but there is always that chance one or two might come through or whatever,"" added Earnshaw. The 31-year-old rejoined hometown club Cardiff in July 2011 on a two-year deal after coming out of contract at Nottingham Forest. But Earnshaw had fallen down the pecking order at the Cardiff City Stadium by the start of this season. Cardiff have a number of attacking options, having recruited the likes of Craig Bellamy, Craig Noone, Heidar Helguson and Nicky Maynard. Earnshaw decided he wanted to play football and went out on loan and has ended up playing in Israel. But now he finds himself living and working in a country which is caught up in a conflict.  ""I have heard them and seen them (missiles),"" said Earnshaw.  ""We were training, just about to start training and we saw the interceptors - because you don't know where the rockets are launched from - go directly in the sky. ""It was literally right above us and they sort of blew up in mid-air. ""That was a bit crazy because you could actually see it explode and then 10 to 15 seconds later you hear the sound and the big bang."" Earnshaw, who is currently out injured with a hamstring strain, has a bunker in his apartment and admits he had has to run for shelter during the violence. On Saturday Maccabi lost 1-0 at Beni Yehuda despite a raid taking place just 45 minutes before kick-off, with the 7,000 supporters who attended the game given emergency instructions. Earnshaw admits fearing for his safety, but he is also enjoying his football in Tel Aviv and is determined to stay there for the meantime. ""It is a bit strange for everyone to have this in Tel Aviv because it never happens here,"" said Earnshaw. ""It is a hard one because the football has been good.  ""Everything is good, we are top of the league, and the team has been doing very well. ""I am hoping this will get better and back to normal, but we will see what happens."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-29617698",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The jungle state of Acre is a long way from anywhere. Tucked into the north-western corner of Brazil, it is closer to the big towns of eastern Bolivia and southern Peru than it is to the industrial heartland of southern Brazil.  Yet it is through here that many migrants looking for a better life or escaping persecution in their own countries choose to enter Brazil.  On the edge of town, where the paved road runs out and where the jungle meets the last few buildings, several times a day small convoys of mini-vans come down the track and people get out. Like new arrivals anywhere, they look slightly bewildered, trying to get an immediate bearing on their surroundings. But they have little need to worry.  For the time being, this is quite possibly one of the most welcoming places on the planet for a migrant or refugee to arrive. The people arriving here at the state migration centre in the town of Rio Branco are mainly from Haiti, Central America, Senegal and beyond.  While many will claim asylum as refugees they are nearly all economic migrants and are recognised as such.  It started as an informal, bilateral understanding between Brazil and Haiti - after Brazil's commitment to Haiti following the earthquake of 2010.  Since then word spread and now many more of the people arriving here are coming from as far afield as West Africa. Some of them, like Matthew from Nigeria, have gone through an awful lot to get here. ""I came here to escape [the Islamist militant group] Boko Haram and the Muslim-Christian fighting in [the Nigerian town of] Jos,"" Matthew tells me, as he nervously holds on to his Bible.  ""My father was forced to convert but my mother was killed in our church. As for my sister, they took her and I've not seen her for a long time."" Matthew says that he arrived here through Ecuador and Peru. The journey is long but thankfully not as arduous as that faced by African migrants fleeing through the Sahara towards Europe. More than 100 people a day are arriving at this holding centre just a couple of hours drive from the Bolivian border.  Spanish, French, Patois - the languages and dialects are sometimes difficult to pick out. Everyone is processed, fed and given a mattress to sleep on.  Among the migrants I spoke to was Jenny, from the Dominican Republic. ""Brazil's well known as the place to come - the Haitians told us that,"" says Jenny, who has a pretty sure idea of what she plans to do next, now that she has made it to Brazil.  ""I'm going to the south to get a job in Santa Catarina. I already have friends down there.""  But, despite the smiles and optimism Jenny has made sacrifices. ""I've got two kids, my mum and dad back home. It was hard to leave them but I have to earn money to send home."" Brazil's policy so far has been to allow most if not all of the migrants and refugees in - partly because the borders here are so porous and there is a demand for migrant labour as the economy has boomed in recent years. Some residents and officials in the state of Acre are concerned that the constant influx of refuges will eventually reach unsustainable levels. Some even describe it as a ""crisis"". However, the Brazilian government does not generally talk about a refugee ""problem"", even though in recent years more than 20,000 migrants from Haiti alone have come here.  According to official figures less than 1% of the population is made up of migrants. Waldeci Nicacio de Lima works as a human rights co-ordinator here in Acre. ""There's always been work for them because they'll accept the jobs Brazilians don't want,"" says the official. ""Word has spread and for the migrants it's like a kind of 'El Dorado'."" Nicacio de Lima also dismisses out of hand recent reports in some Brazilian newspapers that there were concerns about Ebola coming into Brazil through the camp.  They were not being complacent, he said, but no-one was being sent away because of their nationality and they were confident that nobody had arrived from an Ebola-affected area. There is some tension here between the different nationalities and they all keep to their own parts of the centre but conditions are immeasurably better than at other migrant camp I have seen.  As the day progresses, everybody is anxiously waiting for one thing - the appearance of Brazilian work permits, dozens of them. An orderly but excited group of people crowd around a small table set out in the shade of a huge tree as the names are read out.  French sounding names from Haiti, a few Dominicans and several Senegalese are among those the Brazilian official struggles to get right, but no one seems to care. Less than two weeks after arriving many of these migrants now have extensive rights to live and work in Brazil, having secured temporary visas for a year.  The lucky ones have few words but the smiles on their faces say it all.  Most of them are planning to head south, in particular to Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina where there is still - reportedly - plenty of work for them, in agriculture and in factories.  Although the work is invariably poorly paid and unstable, many of the people leaving here already have friends and family members in the south.   Those whose names were not called out return to playing football or sitting in the shade. For those moving on, discrimination and a slowing economy will present challenges.  As dusk falls over the jungle new migrants still arrive, just as bewildered and bleary-eyed after their long journey as the group who arrived that morning. And this will continue as long as Brazil makes them feel welcome."

The group has included video testimony by some of those who could be affected. The government's plan to end all investigations, inquests and civil actions has been denounced by all of Northern Ireland's political parties. Last month, UN human rights experts also expressed serious concerns. Amnesty International has now followed up with the UN Human Rights Council. ""We call on the UN Human Rights Council to challenge the government's plans to shield perpetrators and permanently deny justice to all victims,"" said Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International's Northern Ireland campaigns manager. ""This not only breaches the UK's international and domestic human rights obligations, but unduly interferes in our justice system and undermines the rule of law."" A spokesman for the government said its sympathies were with Troubles' victims and their families but the current system was ""not working well for anybody"". ""It is delivering neither justice nor information to the vast majority of families,"" he said. ""Obtaining information, through thorough and robust investigations, is the cornerstone of the government's proposals."" He said the government ""would consider its next steps carefully"".  The move is seen as the government's way of preventing prosecutions of former soldiers, which stems from a manifesto pledge it made two years ago. Veterans who served in Northern Ireland support the proposals. The government has stated it wants to bring forward legislation later in the autumn. If passed, it would shift the focus on dealing with killings prior to 1998 to providing information for victims' families. One of those who backs Amnesty's intervention is Eugene Oliver, whose father Tom was murdered by the IRA in 1991.  ""Recent developments in the investigation into my father's murder bring us closer than ever to finding out the full truth of what happened and having those responsible held accountable,"" said Mr Oliver. ""If the government's proposals become law, this investigation will end and we'll be condemned to a lifetime of never knowing."""

The Stanley Hospital, which was already performing free breast reconstruction for cancer survivors, will now also offer free breast alteration surgery. The procedures will be largely free for patients on low incomes. Tamil Nadu has one of India's best healthcare delivery systems. Breast reconstruction surgery can cost upwards of 80,000 rupees ($1,233; £880) in private hospitals. The clinic will offer three types of procedures: reconstruction for cancer patients, breast augmentation for those with small breasts and breast reduction for those with large breasts, Dr V Rama Devi, head of plastic surgery at the hospital in Chennai (formerly Madras), told the BBC. While breast reduction and reconstruction will be free, women seeking augmentation will have to pay for implants.  Dr Devi said this was because the need for augmentation was often due to ""psychological problems"". She added that some women with large breasts needed the surgery as they suffered from fungal infection and shoulder pain.  But she said all patients would be examined by a team of doctors before a decision to carry out surgery was taken. ""We encourage them to talk about their problems. We explain to them in detail about changes in their breasts after the surgery,"" she added.  The hospital's plastic surgery unit expects to receive up to 100 patients a month for breast reconstruction surgery."

The Everton striker was asked by England boss Gareth Southgate to be involved against Malta and Slovakia. ""Every time I was selected was a real privilege but I believe now is the time to bow out,"" said the 31-year-old. The former Manchester United captain scored 53 times in 119 internationals.  Right time for Rooney to bow out - Phil Neville Rooney the perfect England captain - Terry Butcher Rooney, overlooked by Southgate for matches against Scotland and France in June, made his England debut in February 2003, in a 3-1 defeat by Australia, external at Upton Park. He made his major tournament debut as an 18-year-old at Euro 2004, and his last international appearance was as captain in last November's 3-0 victory over Scotland at Wembley. Rooney rejoined boyhood club Everton in the summer, and his announcement comes two days after he scored his 200th Premier League goal in a 1-1 draw at Manchester City. After that game, he said he was ""focusing on Everton"" rather than an international recall. ""I'm sure I'll speak to Gareth Southgate over the next few days,"" he added. ""We'll see what happens."" Southgate is due to name a squad on Thursday for the World Cup qualifiers in Malta on 1 September, and at home to Slovakia three days later. It was great Gareth Southgate called me this week to tell me he wanted me back in the England squad for the upcoming matches. I really appreciated that. However, having already thought long and hard, I told Gareth that I had now decided to retire for good from international football. It is a really tough decision and one I have discussed with my family, my manager at Everton and those closest to me. Playing for England has always been special to me. Every time I was selected as a player or captain was a real privilege and I thank everyone who helped me. But I believe now is the time to bow out. Leaving Manchester United was a tough call but I know I made the right decision in coming home to Everton. Now I want to focus all my energies on helping them be successful. I will always remain a passionate England fan. One of my very few regrets is not to have been part of a successful England tournament side. Hopefully the exciting players Gareth is bringing through can take that ambition further and I hope everyone will get behind the team. One day the dream will come true and I look forward to being there as a fan - or in any capacity. BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty Rooney retires from international football as England's record goalscorer - and perhaps with his contribution undervalued. The 31-year-old's career was a mixture of highs and lows after he truly burst on the global scene as a teenager at Euro 2004, and Rooney will forever be associated with an outstanding group of club players who could not replicate their domestic and European success at international level. Rooney did not score at a World Cup until his third attempt - eventually netting against Uruguay in Brazil in 2014 - but he was also a player who carried England on so many occasions and his place in the history books is testimony to his outstanding contribution over so many years. He performed selflessly, often in unfamiliar roles, and his commitment was unquestioned. For all the occasional demands for Rooney to be dropped during his England career, there was rarely much proof they would have been a better team without him. England's lack of success during his time on the international scene will always be a source of frustration and regret, but history may be kinder to Rooney on reflection upon an stellar career. Former England striker Alan Shearer, who announced his own international retirement at 29, said that Rooney's club career would benefit. ""Everton will benefit hugely I'm sure because he won't be flying around the world playing in tournaments, qualifiers and the rest,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""Instead he will be sat at home having a rest and coming into training energised rather than stiff and tired from playing aboard and travelling back."" Ex England manager Roy Hodgson made Rooney his captain in August 2014 following Steven Gerrard's retirement and said the forward relished the responsibility. ""He was very good with me and the rest of the staff in putting across our messages to the players and keeping us informed on everything that was happening,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.  ""Most importantly, he was very good with the younger players. He is older but he has the ability to bond with them. ""He is a great patriot and he could not wait to put the shirt on.  ""If we ever thought it was good for him to have a rest we had to wrestle with him and impose it upon him. If it was up to him, he would play every minute, every second!"" Former England and Manchester United teammate Phil Neville says Rooney's international retirement is a ""sad day"" as he is England's ""greatest ever goalscorer"". ""I remember when he first got into the squad - the youthfulness, the bravery, the courage that he showed, particularly in his first major tournament at Euro 2004,"" Neville told BBC Radio 5 live.  ""He was a breath of fresh air. No-one enjoyed playing for England more than Wayne Rooney."" Neville added: ""It's obviously a day we should be celebrating but also it's a sad day, losing one of our finest ever players. He's definitely the greatest goalscorer we've ever had. ""Now I hope he gets the send-off and the plaudits that he deserves."" Former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who gave Rooney his debut, said he was surprised by the decision. Speaking to BBC World Service, he said: ""If he goes on playing like he is now, scoring goals for Everton, then he could still have been an important player for England, with the World Cup less than a year away. ""If I was the England manager, I would have done everything to convince Rooney to play at the World Cup and then make a decision."" Eriksson, who was England boss from 2001-2006, added: ""I remember when training was finished Rooney didn't want to leave the training ground, he wanted to stay and do free-kicks, shooting etc. He loves his football and that is why he became what he became."""
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58412201",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cristiano Ronaldo broke the world record for goals scored in men's international football as he hit his 110th and 111th goals for Portugal in their dramatic 2-1 World Cup qualifying win over the Republic of Ireland. The 36-year-old scored two late headers - to break and extend the record - after he had a penalty saved by Gavin Bazunu. Ali Daei, who scored 109 goals for Iran between 1993 and 2006, held the record which Ronaldo equalled with a double against France at Euro 2020. The Manchester United forward has also equalled Sergio Ramos' European record for men's caps - with his 180th Portugal appearance. Match report: Portugal 2-1 Republic of Ireland The world record - only ratified by Fifa this summer - is the 195 Malaysia caps won by Soh Chin Ann between 1969 and 1984. Ronaldo, who rejoined United from Juventus on deadline day, and Daei are the only two male players to score 90 or more international goals. ""I'm so happy, not only because I beat the record, but for the special moment that we had,"" he told RTE. ""Two goals at the end of the game. I have to appreciate what the team did, we believed until the end. I'm so glad."" This is the latest landmark to push the argument for the Portuguese to be considered an all-time great. He is already the top scorer in club football's top tournament, the European Cup/Champions League, a trophy he has won five times. The former Real Madrid forward is also the top scorer in European Championship history (14) and in Euros and World Cups combined (21). How has Ronaldo game changed in recent years? Watch Cristiano Ronaldo: Impossible to Ignore on BBC iPlayer now Almost half of Ronaldo's goals have come in the final 30 minutes of games. He has netted 33 times in the final 15 minutes - including twice against the Irish - and 22 times between the 61st and 75th minute. Ronaldo has scored 17 times between minutes 16-30 and 16 times between 31-45, with 11 in the opening 15 minutes of the first half and 12 in the opening 15 minutes of the second half. Some 91 of his goals have been inside the box with 20 from outside. He has scored 14 penalties and nine free-kicks. Lithuania and Sweden - seven each - are the sides he has scored the most against. He had not scored against the Republic of Ireland before Wednesday's game in the Algarve. There is no official database for top men's international goalscorers which makes it hard to say exactly who ranks where. Ronaldo is top on 111 and Daei is next on 109, of that there is no doubt. Iran's Daei, who played for Bayern Munich, was said to have broken Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskas' record in 2003 with his 85th international goal. That is the year Ronaldo made his international debut. Cynics could argue that Daei's goals were against easier opposition - with 95 against fellow Asian sides. He scored eight against the Maldives and Laos and six against Lebanon. But Ronaldo has also benefitted from facing weaker nations including six against Andorra and Luxembourg each. The only question is who ranks below them? Mokhtar Dahari of Malaysia - who played in the 1970s and 80s - is credited as being third in some places with 89 goals. A Fifa tweet this summer seemed to confirm that, external, despite it never being officially validated. Puskas is definitely next, with 84 goals in 85 caps for Hungary. He was the top-scoring European before Ronaldo. Zambia's Godfrey Chitalu scored 79 goals between the 1960s and 1980s - again not certified but also mentioned on that Fifa tweet. Ronaldo is unlikely to beat the world record, including women's football, of Canada striker Christine Sinclair. She has scored 187 goals in 304 caps and has not yet retired. In the strange modern-day phenomena of Ronaldo and Lionel Messi fanboys, this is another tick in the Ronaldo column. Ronaldo's 111 goals in 180 games is well clear of Messi's 76 in 151 - roughly 0.6 goals a game compared with 0.5. Messi - the joint eighth top scorer in the world - is 34 and on current form would need to play into his forties to reach 111 international goals. The highlight of Ronaldo's international career was undoubtedly winning Euro 2016, although he went off injured early in the final. He has scored in two Euros semi-finals too, 12 years apart - against the Netherlands in 2004 and Wales in 2016. His finest hour at a World Cup was a hat-trick against Spain in the group stages three years ago in Russia, including a late free-kick. That is one of his nine international hat-tricks - including one against Switzerland in the 2019 Uefa Nations League semi-finals. He has also scored in all nine major tournaments he has played in - World Cups and European Championships. Including the Confederations Cup and Nations League, he has scored in 11 out of 11. He won the Golden Boot at Euro 2020 with five goals in four games, beating five-goal Czech Patrik Schick on assists. 50 Years of Gaming: How did a humble arcade machine become a multi-billion pound industry?

"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56650685","IMF forecasts stronger recovery for world economy",2021-04-06,"Andrew Walker","BBC World Service economics correspondent","The International Monetary Fund is now forecasting a stronger economic recovery this year and next. The IMF has upgraded both its UK and global forecasts compared with what it projected in January. But the British economy is still predicted to return to its pre-pandemic level of activity only in late 2022.  The agency also warns that recoveries are diverging dangerously within and between countries.  The new UK forecast is for growth of 5.3% this year and 5.1% in 2022. Both figures are upgrades, though the latter is only marginally higher than the January forecast. The recovery follows last year's pandemic driven contraction of 9.9% which was the deepest of any of the G7 major developed economies. Bringing in the two predicted recovery years, the UK's performance over 2020 to 2022 would be ahead of one of the G7 countries, Italy.  The new global forecasts are growth of 6% and 4.4% this year and next. Both are upgrades, a fairly modest one for 2022. That mainly reflects up-rating to the forecast for developed economies, especially the United States.    In a blog on the forecasts, the IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath says a way out of the health and economic crisis is increasingly visible. Vaccinations, she writes, are likely to power recoveries in many countries in 2021. But she is also concerned about how those recoveries are diverging.  Countries with slower vaccine rollouts, more limited support from economic policy, and those more reliant on tourism are likely to do less well.  The first two of these are particular issues for developing countries. Many have less access to vaccines, and they also tend to find it more difficult to finance economic and health policy actions. Among emerging and developing economies, China has already returned to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity. But many others in the group are not expected to do so until well into 2023. The report says the cumulative losses in income per person over the period 2020 to 2022 are likely to be 20% for those countries, compared with a less severe but still large figure of 11% for the developed world.  The report also says that gains in poverty reduction have been reversed. It says people counted as extremely poor are likely to have increased by 95 million last year, with a rise of 80 million in the number who are undernourished.   The IMF says the divergences are occurring not just between but also within countries. Income inequality is likely to increase as young people and those with relatively low levels of skills have been harder hit in both developed and developing countries.   Women have already been affected as they account for a large share of employment in some sectors, such as tourism, where there is a lot of personal contact.  The pandemic has also had an impact on workers whose jobs are vulnerable to automation. That is a process that has been accelerated as a result of the health crisis. "

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30709581",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Known as the ""White Ant"", convicted war criminal Dominic Ongwen is estimated to have been between nine and 14 years old when he was abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) as he was walking to school in northern Uganda - going on over the next 27 years to become a ruthless rebel commander.  Warning: Some people may find details in this story upsetting ""It is a story of a child, like many in the LRA, forced to grow up in the image of their oppressors,"" campaign group LRA Crisis Tracker says. Shortly after his abduction in 1987 or 1988, he tried to escape with three others and when they failed, he was forced to skin alive one of the other abductees as a warning, a psychiatrist at his war crimes trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague said. ""They skinned this person, removed his gut, and put it up on trees,"" Dickens Akena told the court, external. ""And he [Ongwen] said he wouldn't eat meat for two to three months."" Ongwen - whose surname means ""born at the time of the white ant"" - went on to rise rapidly in rebel ranks, becoming a brigadier by his late 20s after winning the confidence of LRA leader Joseph Kony, LRA Crisis Tracker says. But he had a fractious relationship with the LRA warlord, managing to escape his clutches in 2015 when he surrendered - 10 years after he, Mr Kony and three other senior commanders had been indicted by the ICC. He has now been found guilty of 61 of the 70 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, external committed between July 2002 and December 2005 and sentenced to 25 years in jail. They relate to attacks on four camps, guarded by the security forces, set up for those forced to flee their homes because of rebel raids. He was also convicted of charges relating to sexual slavery and conscripting and using children under the age of 15 in hostilities. Claiming to fight for a biblical state, the LRA has killed more than 100,000 people and kidnapped more than 60,000 children during the three-decade long conflict which spread to several of Uganda's neighbours.   Ongwen, who had pleaded not guilty, said he should have been  regarded as a victim too, telling the court: ""I'm one of the people against whom the LRA committed atrocities."" Described as a quiet and playful child, his uncle, Johnson Odong, a court witness, said Ongwen's parents were both dead within a month of his abduction - his mother allegedly bludgeoned by the rebels and his father mistaken for a rebel by the security forces. Primary school teacher P'Atwoga Okello said in a defence witness statement that the boy enjoyed cultural dance classes ""and other areas of the arts"". His teacher in the LRA was Vincent Otti, who went on to become Mr Kony's deputy, with whom he lived after his abduction, according to academic Erin K Baines., external A good teacher could command fierce loyalty after indoctrinating captives through brutal beatings and rituals - followed by military training and looting raids, she says. Ongwen was reportedly eager to please, but initially struggled with the demands of life on the hoof - the long distances travelled on foot, and one ICC witness said he had to be carried across big rivers.  In the mid-1990s he moved to what is now South Sudan from where the LRA conducted operations. By 2001 he was a field commander and he became known for replenishing forces through abduction raids in Uganda, Ms Baines says. ""[He] earned the reputation of being able to emerge from the bloodiest of battles with few casualties among his fighters,"" the Enough Project, another campaign group, says. Dominic Ongwen at a glance: Abducted by the LRA on his way to school Rose to become a top commander Accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including enslavement ICC issued arrest warrant in 2005 US offered $5m (£3.3m) reward for information leading to his arrest in 2013  Transferred to the ICC in 2015 after his surrender. Found guilty of war crimes in 2021. Has Joseph Kony been defeated? One former abductee called him ""a tough fighter who was always on the move"" - though with a limp from a bad leg injury. During the trial, the prosecution presented LRA radio communications intercepted by Ugandan security agencies, showing how Mr Kony - who convinced his army of abductees that his ""spirits"" could read their minds - kept tight command and control over his battalions.   ""Successful commanders were praised by Kony and other senior officers. I remember Dominic Ongwen, referred to as Odomi, frequently being singled out for praise,"" said a radio surveillance officer, whose identity was kept secret, external. But Ongwen also had a volatile relationship with Mr Kony, opposing the execution of Otti in 2007 after the two fell out amid stalled peace talks.  ""LRA defectors report that Ongwen was the only commander who pleaded with Kony to spare Otti's life, a move that weakened his influence within the LRA,"" says LRA Crisis Tracker. ""However, Kony spared Ongwen from the subsequent purge of Otti loyalists due to Ongwen's value to the LRA, particularly his ability to lead troops on daring missions."" The peace initiative took place in a jungle clearing on the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo and what is now South Sudan - with incredible footage of the rebels interacting with mediators. With his trademark dreadlocks and boyish looks, Ongwen is seen looking on cautiously at the proceedings, which observers say ultimately failed because of the refusal to withdraw the ICC's 2005 indictments. For some - including his ""bush wife"", Florence Ayot - this was an injustice.  ""Dominic used to tell us he was abducted when he was very young. Everything he did was in the name of Kony, so he's innocent,"" she told the BBC in 2008. Granted amnesty after escaping from the LRA in 2005, she had been abducted as a nine-year-old and first became the ""wife"" of LRA commander Obwong Kijura, who had raped her at the age of 13. After his death, she told the ICC, external she willingly became Ongwen's ""wife"" as the LRA leader would not allow women to live on their own. She said he treated her son like his own children by his other three ""wives"" at the time and was never violent to her. They had two children together. ""I loved him because of the way he would live with people. He was not quarrelsome, and I felt it was good for me to go to him. There was nothing I disliked about him because I had not seen anything wrong he had done before… We lived happily together."" This jarred with testimony of seven others at the trial, including witness P-227, another of Ongwen's ""wives"", external. Abducted in April 2005, she was allegedly forced to have sex with Ongwen a month later: ""I started crying, I was screaming and my voice was really loud.  ""He asked why I was crying; he told me if I continued crying - he showed me his gun… I felt like my whole body was being torn apart."" She says she was repeatedly raped until her escape in 2010. And escape was a dangerous endeavour - the LRA would threaten to destroy your village if you did so. According to Ms Ayot's testimony, she and Ongwen did plot to go in 2003, but their plan was discovered and her ""husband"" was placed ""under arrest"" by Otti for several weeks.  Some psychiatrists at the trial felt Ongwen was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a dissociative identity disorder at the time of the attacks on the camps, when the prosecution said was he a battalion commander in the Sinia Brigade - becoming its overall commander in March 2004. ICC prosecutors quote witness testimony as saying that on at least one occasion he ordered his men ""to kill, cook and eat civilians"". More than 4,000 victims have participated in the trial - represented by two legal teams - most of them former camp residents - and the trial has detailed the lives lost, destruction, abductions and psychological damage to these communities in northern Uganda. With reports of his killing in 2005 proving to be untrue, Ongwen remained on the run for many more years as the rebels moved west into DR Congo and its other neighbours. In 2013, the US - which had joined the hunt for LRA commanders - offered a $5m (£3.3m) reward for information leading to Ongwen's capture.  An LRA escapee alleged that Mr Kony ordered that Ongwen be severely beaten for insubordination at the end of 2014. In bad shape he eventually escaped from the LRA camp in Darfur, making it from Sudan to neighbouring Central African Republic (CAR), where he was taken into custody. At the time he asked for forgiveness from the Ugandan people, but within 10 days he had been transferred to the ICC.  According to Justiceinfo.net, external, during his pre-trial incarceration he seemed to enjoy his chance to pursue an education, including piano-lessons. Though he threatened suicide, external and went on hunger strike, external in 2016 in rows over phone calls to his family - he had initially been barred from talking to his children. Some argue that the trial has been a proxy prosecution of Mr Kony, whose rebel movement is much weaker these days but is still active outside Uganda. Nonetheless two versions of Ongwen emerged during his trial: one of a brutal killer, the other of a traumatised child soldier who grew up to be a conflicted man."

Gemma Morgan says during her six years in the Army from 1996, toxic masculinity permeated into her life, leaving her ""too assertive, too competitive, and too masculine for civilian life"". Flashbacks from Kosovo and a difficult transition to civilian life culminated in a mental health crisis. To mark International Women's Day, Ms Morgan, now a speaker, leadership coach and mental health campaigner living in Monmouthshire, shares what she learnt from stepping ""over the patriarchal line"".  The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said ""great strides"" had been made but it was grateful to current and former servicewomen ""whose testimony makes clear that on too many occasions Defence failed to provide adequate support"". ""My choice to join the Army in 1996 was unconventional.  ""I was stepping outside of traditional gender boundaries.  ""Through school, I was taught that girls could have it all, but the hard truth was by becoming a female soldier I became an immediate outlier.  ""At the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, we were one of the first intakes to do the same training as the men.  ""Female platoons were kept separate and only a handful of roles were open to women, but it felt exciting to step over the patriarchal line. ""I became accustomed to a hyper-masculine environment and assumed the behaviours to fit in.  ""No-one actually says it or writes it down but I understood that I would need to perform to a much higher standard to succeed.  ""Inevitably, I became more masculine - no make-up, no heels, anything to blend in.  ""My tone turned more assertive and direct, my presence more commanding.  ""I began cursing profanities mid-sentence with my peers.  ""You didn't want to be the girl in the Army that looks weak, because they already thought that you were weak.  ""I learned to hide any sense of vulnerability, to hold this veneer of defiant perfection at all times.   ""No-one told me about the dangers of the double-bind - being masculine enough to prove yourself but not so much that you are a threat. Or being too feminine and considered weak.  ""The Army taught me that I was capable of achieving so much more than I ever imagined.  ""I miss being a sister in the brotherhood, the connection, the teamwork and knowing that someone has your back.  ""I miss the adrenaline, the discipline and the focus in life.  ""But I do not miss wearing men's combat boots in a smaller size because they don't make kit for women. ""I do not miss wearing a uniform that cut across my boobs and thighs. I do not miss the less palatable side.  As a troop commander, I was sexually assaulted - it was Christmas drinks with officers going to the sergeants' mess.  ""As I was leaving a senior soldier approached and forced me into a small closet where the public phone was found.  ""I remember the stench of his breath, his hands lunging at my body.  ""I didn't complain - I didn't know who to turn to or what to say.  ""Uninvited groping was commonplace at the bar or under the table at formal dinner nights.  ""Groups of men would run scorecards with names of nightly conquests listed down the side. ""One officer's party trick was to 'weigh' your breasts, leaning in to mumble his cheeks against your cleavage for good measure. It was accepted as a jovial part of army life.  ""From day one, we learned that such behaviour was part of the deal.  ""In training, a male officer would let himself into our rooms and we would wake to find him standing over our beds in the middle of the night.  ""There was a complaint but no meaningful action was taken.  ""At the regiment, soldiers mounted their walls with hard-core pornography before a room inspection - when I asked for it to be removed I was laughed at, branded 'frigid' and 'uptight'.  ""It was persistent and seemingly endless but I learned to let it all wash over me - it was simply a fact of life. ""In many respects, I was lucky - my physical strength meant that I could hold my own amongst the men and comfortably meet the fitness standards required.   ""In 1999, I was ranked the best young officer in the corps and awarded the Carmen Sword by the Princess Royal. ""I remember arriving at my new posting and when the colonel welcomed me I could no longer have the role that had been assigned.  ""He had  been decided that they did not want a woman being the face of the Corps.  ""To use his words precisely - I was the best person for the job but not the right person.  ""It felt almost impossible to be a good Army Officer and a woman at the same time.  ""In 2001, I captained my country at lacrosse and to the outside world I seemed fine.  ""But I was running on fumes, profoundly empty and raging inside.  ""Flashbacks would haunt me - meat hanging of shattered limbs, eyes without a soul, without light. Behind closed doors vodka, Valium and sleeping pills numbed the pain but the nightmares continued, aggressive and persistent.  ""When the suggestion of mental illness came, it terrified me - it meant more weakness, something that any self-respecting soldier would despise.  ""The gossip around the regiment shattered my credibility overnight. There was no confidentiality, nowhere to hide. I felt cast out by the brotherhood, betrayed by the family that I had worked so hard to be accepted by.   ""I left the Army of my own accord - angry, running away, perhaps hoping that the nightmares would stop.   ""Overnight I became a spectator, cut off from the military family and struggling to function as a new mother, a civilian and a wife.  ""The transition was jolting, one minute you were in and then you were gone.  ""I slept with a weapon next to my bed because it made me more comfortable.  ""My game face was set permanently, constantly checking behind me, scanning the windows and corners.  ""I walked with a look designed to make someone think twice. ""Life as a new mum wasn't what I had imagined.  ""I had moved away from this highly disciplined environment into motherhood, with a new born baby that would not stop crying.  ""I looked for a community in veteran spaces, only to find rooms of men drinking pints and telling war stories.  ""On Remembrance Days I felt invisible, assumed to be there in support of my husband's former life.  ""I joined mums' coffee mornings but it felt awkward - the acceptable language, the dress code, the civilian humour.   ""I was the product of a masculine culture that did not tolerate femininity.  ""Outside of the wire, my behaviours violated given stereotypes.  ""Everything the Army had taught me was now deemed too assertive, too competitive, and too masculine for civilian life.  ""A woman was somehow expected to show a more refined, a more subtle and softer side.  ""Add the additional layer of mental illness and you have a pressure cooker of stigma that was holding on too tight.  ""At the age of 33, I tried to take my life.  ""I was found by the roadside, delirious and choking on my own vomit.  ""My imagination led me to barns with burnt corpses hanging off beams.  ""I saw ditches with bodies lying face down.  ""At around 2am each morning the same dead boy would stare at me through glazed brown eyes. It was exhausting.  ""My body became ill as well as my mind.  ""Today, I am immensely proud of my military service and of serving alongside some remarkable women and men.  ""But I regret the way that I allowed such toxic masculinity permeate into my life.  ""My eyes are now open to the unspoken behaviour that others and myself normalised.  ""I now value the womanhood that is essential to my being and I have developed the courage to show who I am with vulnerability, power and strength all at the same time.  ""And in being true to myself I am at last feeling better and sometimes I feel amazing."" ""In school we are still teaching that women can have the same opportunities as men.

We are committed to improving the experience for women in the Armed Forces in every area of their lives. ""Anyone who falls short of our high standards of behaviour will be dealt with robustly, including dismissal and possible police investigation. There is no room for any form of discrimination in the military.""

Bosses said on Monday that they hope to operate the station, named ""Orbital Reef,"" by the end of the decade.  Promotional material released by the company claims the station will be a ""mixed-use business park"" in space and will host up to 10 people.  The company will partner with Sierra Space and Boeing to build the outpost. Blue Origin said the 32,000 sq ft station would provide customers with an ideal location for ""film-making in microgravity"" or ""conducting cutting-edge research"" and said it would also include a ""space hotel"". At a press conference to launch the initiative, executives from Blue Origin and Sierra Space declined to give an estimate of the building costs, though the project seems assured of heavy funding from Mr Bezos, who has committed to spending $1bn (£726m) a year on Blue Origin.  The announcement comes as Nasa searches for proposals to replace the 20-year-old International Space Station (ISS). While funding for the station has been guaranteed until at least 2030, the outpost is in desperate need of repairs.  Russian officials have previously warned that its cosmonauts could leave the station by 2025 over fears outdated equipment could trigger a major incident.  In response, Nasa announced plans earlier this year to award $400m in private contracts to space companies to help the agency replace the ageing outpost.  However, there is likely to be stiff competition for the funding. Earlier this week, a partnership between Nanoracks, Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin announced its own plans to launch a space station into low orbit by 2027.  Blue Origin has faced mixed fortunes so far this year. High-profile launches of its New Shepard rocket, which saw Mr Bezos and Star Trek star William Shatner blasted into space, gained significant media attention.  But the company has also faced accusations of sexual harassment in the workplace and of turning a blind eye to serious safety concerns from former employees.  Last month it missed out on a lucrative $2.9bn Nasa contract which went to billionaire Elon Musk's Space X, one of Blue Origin's chief rivals in the commercial space race."

The lead character is thought to be loosely-based on Sir Philip, who owns the Arcadia group which includes Topshop and Burton. Steve Coogan plays a billionaire boss of a retail empire in crisis. He told the BBC it was not a ""direct attack"" on Sir Philip. An Arcadia spokesperson would not comment on the release of the film. The release follows the fictional Sir Richard McCreadie as he appears before a parliamentary select committee and throws an extravagant party on Mykonos. Sir Philip, now based in Monaco, has been accused of tax avoidance and was questioned by MPs on his role in the demise of the chain BHS. He was also criticised for holding a lavish party in the Maldives which allegedly featured topless dancers and a giant Buddha statue. It was said to be at odds with the culture of the islands. In an interview with the BBC, Steve Coogan said that although Greed is just one letter away from Green, the film ""is not a direct attack"" on the retailer. Mr Coogan said: ""He's [Sir Philip] a charismatic figure, it was a good basis on which to develop this movie idea."" In Greed, Mr Coogan and director Michael Winterbottom target bosses of multinational companies, who he says are turning over ""massive profits"" while factories they use in developing nations like Sri Lanka pay their workers about £3 a day. Arcadia has denied using sweatshops and expressed disappointment when it has been ""found a supplier had clearly breached"" its code of conduct. In a press release promoting the film's release, the character McCreadie is said to have been called ""the acceptable face of capitalism"". Sir Philip was branded as the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"" in a damning report by MPs that found Sir Philip left BHS ""on life support"". BHS went bust in April 2016, leaving a £571m pensions deficit. He eventually paid out £363m of his personal wealth to help shore it up. Last year, Sir Philip prevented the collapse of his Arcadia group when creditors approved a restructuring plan. "
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57250378",NA,NA,NA,NA,"England's countdown to the Euros continued with a narrow win over Austria at Riverside Stadium - but they suffered an injury setback as Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold limped off late on. Manager Gareth Southgate saw his experimental side secure victory when Arsenal teenager Bukayo Saka crowned a fine move with an angled finish for his first international goal after 56 minutes. Southgate, who named his 26-man squad for the Euros on Tuesday, picked a side with an unfamiliar look as players involved with Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City in the Europa League and Champions League finals were not selected, so he will be happy to come out with a win - but it was not a convincing display. England survived scares when Everton defender Ben Godfrey, making his debut as a substitute, sent keeper Jordan Pickford scrambling to retrieve a wayward backpass, while the keeper touched Marcel Sabitzer's shot onto the bar. And as Alexander-Arnold walked gingerly around the pitch with the England medical staff, debutant Ben White cleared off the line from Alessandro Schopf after Pickford's punch fell to him in the area. The victory means England have won their past seven friendly matches, their best run in friendlies since winning seven in a row under Sir Bobby Robson between June 1985 and May 1986. 'Grealish and Alexander-Arnold sum up England's mixed fortunes' 'Some people aren't understanding the message' - Southgate criticises fans who booed 'It's not a good situation' - Southgate to wait for Alexander-Arnold injury update Reaction to England's win against Austria Alexander-Arnold's selection for the Euros was the big debating point in the build-up to the squad announcement, with Southgate ultimately deciding he was simply too big a talent to leave out. And that talent was on display at the Riverside in both a defensive and attacking context, before the worrying sight of the 22-year-old moving gingerly around the perimeter of the pitch in the dying seconds, accompanied by England medical staff with his shirt pulled over his head in disappointment. It marred a night when England got the win against Austria, albeit with a less than impressive performance which was perhaps to be expected with a much-changed side forced on Southgate by those many absentees, which saw him select Jesse Lingard even though he is not in the Euros squad. Alexander-Arnold's fitness, however, will be the big takeaway as he clutched his thigh following a routine clearance, collapsing to the ground before being consoled by Conor Coady, insult being added to injury when he was shown a yellow card by referee Lawrence Visser for returning to the pitch without permission, even if it was only for a few seconds. Liverpool's Alexander-Arnold was one of four right-backs included in Southgate's squad so it is hardly a crisis in that position but he will not want to be without a player who can provide such quality. It was fitting that Saka scored his first international goal, illustrating his value to England, while Jack Grealish produced a man-of-the-match performance that fully deserved the ovation he received when he came off. Grealish was England's main creator and driving force - but it was not such an impressive night for his Aston Villa team-mate Tyrone Mings, who was fortunate to escape a moment of recklessness in the first half when he appeared to drive his arm straight into Austria striker Sasa Kalajdzic in the area, flattening him in an incident that was missed by the referee. England lived on their nerves late on and were grateful to some wasteful Austrian finishing and desperate defending to close out the win as Southgate moves on to Sunday's final pre-Euros friendly against Romania back here on Teesside with a much stronger side at his disposal. Austria have lost consecutive matches for the first time since losing to Poland and Israel in March 2019. Aged 19, Bukayo Saka became the third teenager to score for England while playing for Arsenal, along with Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Jude Bellingham became the youngest player to start a game for England (17 years and 338 days) since Wayne Rooney in September 2003 vs Liechtenstein (17 years and 321 days). England have not lost any of their last 19 matches when an Arsenal player has scored (W17 D2) since Francis Jeffers scored in a 3-1 home defeat by Australia in February 2003. Saka was the 33rd different player to score a goal for England under Gareth Southgate, one more than scored for the Three Lions under Sir Bobby Robson and the most since 39 scored under Sir Alf Ramsey. Ben White became the fifth Brighton player to play for England after Tommy Cook, Peter Ward, Steve Foster and Lewis Dunk. England have won all seven matches when Brighton players have featured, the best 100%-win record when players from a club represent the England national team. England manager Gareth Southgate speaking to ITV: ""I thought we started very well. We used the ball well in the first hour or so. We were playing against a very good side. They have good players. They get in between the lines well. ""The first hour was good in terms of quality. After that we needed to make a lot of changes and preserve people. We got a bid disjointed and people had cramp. We were hanging on at the end. It was understandable given the changes. ""Jack Grealish showed some lovely touches. You can see he's still getting to full fitness - with the bursts you know he can make. He's a quality player.""

""We are going through the selection process now,"" Neville said.  ""The longlist has been selected and the players from all countries have been notified."" Team GB reached the quarter-finals at London 2012 but did not enter a team for the Rio 2016 Olympics because the four home nation football associations could not reach an agreement on fielding a combined side. Wales, England, Northern Ireland and Scotland agreed in October to allow a GB women's team to try to reach Tokyo, but qualification depended on England's progress in the World Cup in France as the nominated side. Neville guided England to fourth place at the World Cup earlier in the summer, a finish that secured a place at the Olympics for a combined GB team. Football Association of Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford has said there will be ""no prohibition"" to Wales players being picked for Team GB, though the FAW stance is that it is against the concept of a British side. ""It is a difficult process to go through because you have to pay respects to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in terms of contact with their players,"" Neville added.

But Raab said professional sport may be able to return ""because of the scale of testing"" that could be introduced. The BBC reported on Saturday how the government has plans for a series of meetings to help elite sport resume. The move was described by a source close to the plans as a ""quickening of the pace"" and intended to help sport resume ""within weeks"", if progress was made.

The body, which works to stabilise economic growth, admitted tax cuts announced by Kwasi Kwarteng would boost growth in the short-term. But it said the cuts would ""complicate the fight"" against soaring prices. It expects high prices to last longer in the UK with only Slovakia out of the eurozone set to see higher inflation. Inflation, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, is expected to peak at about 11.3% before the end of the year in the UK, according to the IMF's latest assessment of the global economy. In each of the next two years, it expects price rises will average at about 9% - far above the Bank of England's target of 2%. Although the UK economy is set to grow the fastest of the major economies included in the G7 group this year, it is projected to grind to a near-halt next year, with it expanding by just 0.3%.  The most recent figures included in the report by the influential financial institution do not fully, however, take into account the UK chancellor's recent mini-budget. After Mr Kwarteng unveiled plans for huge tax cuts in the UK, the IMF criticised the plans warning they were likely to increase inequality and add to pressures pushing up prices. It was an unusually outspoken statement from the IMF, which has a key role in acting as an early economic warning system. The IMF said it understood the government's mini-budget aimed to boost growth, but it said that the tax cuts could speed up the pace of price rises, which the UK's central bank, the Bank of England, is trying to bring down. Downing Street defended the chancellor's plans, with the Prime Minister's official spokesperson saying its policies aimed ""to support British people at a time of global high prices"" and said the IMF report showed ""the global challenges that countries are facing"". The IMF warned the global economy was facing a downturn with ""the worst yet to come"" as war in Ukraine helps push prices higher around the globe. ""For many people 2023 will feel like a recession,"" it warned. It said governments and central banks globally had to work together to help people through the turmoil. The IMF's Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told the BBC: ""Imagine a car with two drivers at the front and each of them has a steering wheel - and one wants to go left and the other wants to go right."" He added: ""One is the central bank trying to cool off the economy so that price pressures will ease, and the other one wants to spend more to support families... it's probably not going to work very well."" In the UK, the chancellor has already said he will bring forward his economic plan where he will spell out how he plans to pay for the tax cuts and provide an independent forecast on the UK economy's prospects, a move welcomed by the IMF. However on Tuesday, government borrowing costs remained close to the levels seen at the height of the market turmoil last month despite fresh action from the Bank of England to try and stabilise financial markets. The IMF has said ""the worst is yet to come"" in the world economy, saying ""for many people 2023 will feel like a recession"".  It made the comments as it downgraded forecast growth around the world as a result of a longer-lasting inflationary shock, arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Rising global interest rates, and a strong dollar, are adding to these pressures, said the world's most important international financial institution. The direct impact of the gas shutdowns in continental Europe means some major economies are hit even more badly - Germany and Italy are now predicted to contract next year. The projections do not fully take into account the chancellor's mini budget and its aftermath, which will ""lift growth somewhat in the near term"", but ""complicate the fight against inflation"".  The IMF criticised the UK's mini-budget in stark terms last month, and also repeated a more general warning about untargeted fiscal support, without mentioning the UK specifically. The IMF also cautioned that governments would need to protect the least well-off from the impact of higher prices. Poorer households often spend relatively more than others on food, heating, and fuel, it pointed out - all areas that have seen steep price rises as energy and grain exports have been restricted after the invasion of Ukraine. And countries that are reliant on Russian gas in Europe are being hit particularly badly. Germany's economy, for example, is now predicted to contract next year. Meanwhile, Russia's economy is expected to contract by 2.3% next year, the biggest fall of all the nations included in the projections. Speaking on Monday, IMF boss Kristalina Georgieva noted that growth was also being dragged down in China by continued Covid restrictions, while in the US rising interest rates were ""starting to bite"". At the first in-person meetings between the IMF and the World Bank since the pandemic, she said countries could ""reduce the pain ahead of us in 2023"" by acting together. She added that the IMF will be pushing for major economies to carry on with their efforts to bring down the cost of living, even if they have a negative impact on economic growth. If they don't do enough, she said, ""we are in trouble. We cannot afford inflation to be a runaway train."""

Organiser Steve Grimwood said this year's edition was ""truly global"" with 600 riders from 20 nations entered. The competitors will race on bikes that look similar to road bikes, but have knobbly tyres, around multiple laps of a 3km (1.9-mile) circuit. The course features a fast start on a road section at the Suffolk Show showground, two purpose-built bridges, grassy corners, a 40m (131ft) sand pit, and woodland, plus steps and hurdles where riders will have to dismount, run with their bikes and remount. Mr Grimwood said it was an ""exciting and spectator-friendly"" sport, which is free for spectators, and that riders were arriving with ""big smiles on their faces"". ""Last year we were really struggling with the Covid regulations... so this year, it's been a real relief to organise the championships without having all of those worries and to be welcoming everyone from all over the world,"" he said. ""It's a bit like a big family gathering, everybody coming together, they all have the same passion for cyclo-cross and they are really looking forward to seeing all their friends, having good, tough racing."" The event, organised with support from East Suffolk Council, starts with races for women competitors aged over 55 at 11:45 GMT, followed by categories for men aged 60 upwards in the afternoon. Saturday will see women aged between 45 and 54 take to the start line. Men aged between 40 and 59 will also be competing across four different races. The younger age groups will race on Sunday. Among those competing was Gjertrud Boe, from Norway, who got bronze in Friday's 60-plus women's category. She is the current European champion for her age group and has been world champion twice before, but she was unable to come last year because of the Covid restrictions  The 60-year-old from Oslo said it was a ""really fun race"". Meanwhile, Maria Fernandez, 49, and her partner Jorge have returned to Ipswich from Madrid for the second time. She said they were both ""so happy"" to be back in Suffolk and were ""looking forward"" to racing on Saturday. ""But at the same time, we don't want it to finish because it's the last year here and we enjoy it a lot,"" she said.  On Thursday, more than 100 schoolchildren took part in School Games to get a taste of cyclo-cross, and on Sunday, an event for riders with learning difficulties will take place. Next year's World Masters event will be in Hamburg, Germany. ""Skinny tyres, mud, short, sharp off-road races, with hurdles, obstacles and intense action,"" says British Cycling. It is considered to be one of the most accessible forms of cycle sport with racing for everyone from young kids to grandparents.  The season takes place throughout autumn and winter and races are held at off-road venues such as public parks and other open spaces.  Surfaces can include grass, mud, gravel and sand, and courses are short and winding, enabling multiple laps to be completed. Riders race for a set time, ranging from 10 minutes for the under-12s to an hour for the senior men. Courses often feature obstacles such as hurdles, steps and sand pits, forcing riders to dismount and carry or run with their bikes.

Plans to demolish the terminal and build a new one costing up to £150m have been recommended for approval. An open letter signed by 114 people says plans to increase the airport's size and passenger numbers is ""fundamentally wrong"". Leeds City Council is due to make a final decision on Thursday. The authority said the case would be referred to a government minister if approved by councillors. Leeds Bradford currently has about four million passengers annually but hopes to increase numbers to seven million over 10 years. In July 2020, a group of climate scientists said the expanded airport's greenhouse gas emissions would be higher than those allowed for the whole of Leeds in 10 years' time. Labour MPs from four out of five Leeds constituencies - Hilary Benn, Alex Sobel, Richard Burgon, Fabian Hamilton - and Bradford East MP Imran Husain have signed the letter. They tell the 13 councillors who will make the decision: ""Expansion would mean health-damaging increases in noise, traffic and air pollution for thousands of people in our local communities.  ""Above all, it would mean a huge increase in greenhouse gas emissions exactly when we need to cut them to prevent the worst effects of the climate crisis. Expansion would be fundamentally wrong."" The letter adds: ""The Covid crisis has exposed how vulnerable we are as individuals and as a society.  ""The climate crisis will be far worse - unless we make the right decisions now.  ""We call on [the councillors] to use their legal powers to make the right decision for the future - for the good of our children, grandchildren and future generations.""  A spokesperson for Leeds City Council said: ""This is a significant planning application and the council recognises that it has generated a considerable amount of public attention. ""Taking into account the material submitted on both sides and balancing all the considerations, planning officers have recommended that the application be approved, subject to a section 106 agreement and referral to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government."" The airport has been approached for a response to the letter. Chief executive Hywel Rees has previously said the proposal was about meeting expected demand ""in a more efficient way, with a smaller environmental footprint"" and to help the airport better support the region's economic growth.

The action has caused international outrage because the debris could threaten the International Space Station (ISS) and satellites in low-Earth orbit. Russia's test of an anti-satellite (A-Sat) missile system is not the first of its kind. Back in 2007, China tested its own missile system against one of its own weather satellites in orbit. The explosion created more than 3,000 pieces of debris the size of a golf ball or larger - and more than 100,000 much smaller pieces. Of the orbiting fragments considered a threat to the ISS, about a third are from this Chinese test. And at the speeds these objects travel in orbit, even small pieces can threaten spacecraft with destruction. The A-Sat tests fit into the wider issue of space debris, which is being made worse by our continued activities in space. There is now a wild jungle of junk overhead - everything from old rocket stages that continue to loop around the Earth decades after they were launched, to the flecks of paint that have lifted off once shiny space vehicles and floated off into the distance. It is the legacy of 64 years of space activity. It's estimated there is close to 10,000 tonnes of hardware in orbit - much of it still active and useful, but far too much of it defunct and aimless. Almost 30,000 pieces of debris are being tracked on a daily basis. These are just the big, easy-to-see items, however. Go below the scale of 1cm (0.39in), and objects move around more or less untracked. There may be 300 million of these. All of this stuff is travelling at several kilometres per second - sufficient velocity for them to become damaging projectiles if any were to strike an operational space mission. The threat was starkly demonstrated in 2009 when an active communications satellite operated by the US company Iridium and a defunct Soviet-era military communications satellite were obliterated when they collided in orbit. Now consider the threat to a space vehicle with humans aboard.  On Monday, Russia carried out the A-Sat test from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, about 800km (500 miles) north of Moscow. The missile destroyed an old Soviet spy satellite, called Kosmos 1408, that was once part of Russia's Tselina radio signals surveillance programme. US State Department spokesman Ned Price said the destruction of Kosmos 1408 had generated about 1,500 pieces of larger orbiting objects, for which tracking information is available to civilian sources. But it also created hundreds of thousands of smaller fragments. Some of these tinier objects likely can be tracked, although we won't  know because the US military wouldn't want to give away information about its sensor capabilities. But other fragments probably are too small to detect from the ground. The debris field from the A-Sat test is found at an altitude of between 440km and 520km above Earth, threatening the ISS, China's Tiangong space station and other spacecraft. When the ISS passed close to the debris cloud on Monday, crew members were told to shelter in the Soyuz and Crew Dragon spacecraft attached to the orbiting outpost. This is so that the crew could detach and come back to Earth if the space station was damaged by fragments of the satellite. While vehicles such as the space shuttle were hit by smaller pieces of debris, it's likely that a collision with any large objects at orbital speeds would be catastrophic to the ISS. The action by Russia has been condemned by other countries, including the US and the UK. The Russian military said it was carrying out planned activities to strengthen its defence capabilities, but denied the test was dangerous. ""The United States knows for certain that the resulting fragments, in terms of test time and orbital parameters, did not and will not pose a threat to orbital stations, spacecraft and space activities,"" it said. Many countries now have their own A-Sat systems; the US and Russia (and previously the USSR) have been developing weapons of this kind since the 1950s. In 1985, the US used a missile launched from an F-15 fighter jet to destroy the Solwind scientific satellite. After the Chinese A-Sat incident in 2007, the US military again shot down one of its own satellites - at a lower altitude than the Chinese or Russian operations - using a ship-launched missile. The lower height above the Earth was intended to ensure that any debris would quickly burn up in the atmosphere rather than staying aloft to threaten space-based assets. Then in 2019, India tested its own weapon, during an operation codenamed Mission Shakti. The missile struck a test satellite in a lower orbit than those targeted by Moscow or Beijing, generating more than 200 pieces of trackable debris. Since modern militaries rely on satellites for intelligence gathering, navigation and communications, A-Sat technologies could be used to undermine an adversary's command and control system during conflict.  Gravity ensures that everything that goes up will eventually come back down - but the bath is currently being filled faster than the plug hole and the overflow pipe can empty it. Some material from the A-Sat tests will come down to Earth, out of harm's way, but a significant proportion will head off to high altitudes where they will remain a hazard for years to come. Humans and nature are also conspiring in unexpected ways to make the situation worse. The extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere down the years has cooled some of its highest reaches - the thermosphere. This - combined with low levels of solar activity - have shrunk the atmosphere, limiting the amount of drag on orbital objects that ordinarily helps to pull debris from the sky. In other words, the junk is also staying up longer. Leaving aside the growth in debris from collisions for a moment, the number of satellites being sent into space is also increasing rapidly. Go back to the 2000s, and the average for the number of satellites launched each year would be about 100. In this decade, the proliferation of small satellite technologies will likely see the annual average rise above 1,000. By and large, everyone operating in orbit now follows international mitigation guidelines. Or tries to. These include ensuring there is enough propellant at the end of a satellite's life so that it can be pulled out of the sky or at the very least pushed into a graveyard orbit.  Hardware that can't be commanded to de-orbit should have its fuel tanks vented and its batteries disconnected to reduce the chances of an explosion (a major source of the debris now up there). The goal is to make sure all low-orbiting material is removed within 25 years of launch. However, compliance, even from well-intentioned actors, has traditionally been quite poor. There are lots of ideas out there to clean up space. Many of them look far-fetched and utterly impractical. Some of the more sensible proposals have reached the demonstration phase. The Japanese-UK company Astroscale is currently in orbit showcasing how it would approach and grab redundant and uncooperative hardware. It's likely soon to have to perform this procedure for real on a broadband satellite belonging to the UK operator OneWeb.  It has a spacecraft in its fleet that has failed at an altitude of more than 1,000km. At that height, the satellite would take many centuries to come down on its own. It has been calculated that just taking away a few key spent rocket stages or broken satellites each year would substantially reduce the potential for collision and cap the growth in space debris over coming decades."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62833111","Two government departments reprimanded by UK data watchdog",2022-09-08,"Shiona McCallum","Technology reporter","Two government departments have been reprimanded by a watchdog for not responding to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests on time. It is the first time in seven years the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued an FOI enforcement notice.  The Department for International Trade (DIT) had the worst response rate across all government departments. Action was also taken against the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The ICO is an independent watchdog. Its central aim is to promote openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals. It has issued this latest action against the DIT and BEIS for what it calls ""persistent failures"" to respond. It said the action comes as it renews its approach to regulating the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which commits to taking action against public authorities with consistently poor performance. John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, said: ""Accountability and transparency in the work of public authorities is fundamental to democracy and it is the ICO's role to ensure that people's right to access information is protected. ""I advise public authorities to take note and learn lessons from the action we have taken today, as we will be making greater use of our powers under the Act to drive good practice and compliance."" FOI consultant Martin Rosenbaum told the BBC this was a welcome decision.  ""It is the kind of firm and determined action which has been badly needed to tackle serious failings on FOI in government departments.  ""It should make it clear to the public authorities with the worst records on FOI compliance that there are limits to what they can get away with. If the new Commissioner continues to show much greater determination and effectiveness in enforcing the FOI Act, it will make a big difference to improving how the system can work in practise for the public benefit,"" he said. The ICO said DIT was late answering more than half of requests from January to March. The department's response times declined in 2021 despite no significant increase in requests or known resource issues at the department. The ICO said the delays were ""simply due to internal process failings, rather than more significant problems"". The department has been told it must respond to any outstanding requests older than 20 working days within 35 calendar days of the enforcement notice. It should also publish an action plan formalising measures to mitigate any future delays. Failure to comply with the notice could lead to the department being found in contempt of court, it has been warned. A DIT spokesperson said: ""We are fully committed to our transparency obligations and responded to over 500 FOI requests received last year.  ""We continue to evaluate and improve our internal processes and will respond to the ICO in due course."" BEIS was told to improve its performance, after it ""consistently failed to respond to a significant number of the information access requests received within the statutory time limit"". BEIS has had a 55% increase in requests since 2020, but the ICO found the department's internal procedures were the cause of many responses being delayed, as well as the volume increases. The ICO said that because of mitigations by BEIS and its positive engagement with the watchdog, it was only issued with a practice recommendation rather than an enforcement notice. But the regulator said an enforcement notice could be issued if performance does not improve. A BEIS spokesperson said: ""We are committed to handling requests in a timely way while managing this alongside tackling the energy crisis and driving economic growth, and we are engaging with the ICO's office on the next steps.""

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/55099991",NA,NA,NA,NA,"An idol, hero and even a god. Argentina is a nation in mourning after the passing of Diego Maradona at the age of 60.  A World Cup winner with his country, a hero in Naples and with the added lifestyle of a rockstar - Maradona's legacy is as legendary off the pitch as it is on it.   For Gerardo Bruna, it is ""hard to put into words"" what Maradona meant, and still means, to the people of Argentina.  The former Liverpool midfielder, who has spent the past two seasons with Derry City, grew up in Spain but was born in Argentina. Gerardo Bruna: From the Bernabeu to the Brandywell 'The magician, the cheat, the god, the flawed genius' Despite being too young to remember Maradona playing, he says the he was amazed how much the Argentina legend captured the hearts of a nation. ""It's strange how much he means because I never saw him play,"" said the 29-year-old.  ""My dad grew up watching him and was a huge fan. Every parent in Argentina probably wants their kids to be a bit like him.  ""He put this in my head since I was a baby - it was Maradona, Maradona, Maradona."" Bruna says that in Argentina and Naples, where Maradona changed the outlook of a deprived city while playing for Napoli, he was ""much more than just a football player"".  ""Even recently, everyone wanted to be around him and everyone wanted to see him. The Pope even kissed his hand. I think it is the aura - had had something that was just incredible.  ""He came from nothing to reach the highest point in football - winning the World Cup and becoming one of the best, if not the best, ever. ""It sends a message to everyone that you can become something. He gave people hope and I think that is why he is so loved and such an idol."" Bruna got the opportunity to meet his hero in 2008 shortly after moving to Liverpool. Maradona had just been appointed Argentina's manager and arrived at Liverpool's training ground at Melwood to meet with midfielder Javier Mascherano. ""I think we were having a shower after training and someone said 'Maradona is coming'. Everyone was rushing to see him,"" he added. ""There was a queue of people waiting to go into Rafa Benitez's office. People were quickly printing off photos for him to sign. It was crazy.  ""I've never seen anything like it. It was the whole training ground. Players, staff, secretaries and the people who worked in the kitchen.  ""Everyone was there waiting to meet him, which tells you the magnitude of who he is. The photos are like treasure.""  After training with the likes of Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Fernando Torres, Bruna admits the only time he has been star struck in his young career was when he met his childhood hero. ""I couldn't speak much English at the time. I came into the office and Benitez said I was from Argentina. Maradona looked at me and joked 'what the hell are you doing here?'.  ""I gave him a hug, we took a picture and spoke for a minute or so but there were so many people waiting we didn't get long.  ""I've met amazing players and amazing people, but I've never really wanted to go and take a picture with them. With him, maybe because of the connection I had with my Dad which made my idolise him, it was the first moment that I really wanted to capture.  ""I've got it in a small frame. I always look at it, but I never really valued it until recently. My dad was trying to get me to post it on social media for his 60th birthday a few weeks ago.""  Bruna admits he was shocked by the news of Maradona's passing, with the news breaking as he was preparing to take on Sligo Rovers in the FAI Cup quarter-final-final.  ""Then when the news came through it was like 'wow'. It was a really sad moment because it came into my head about the few words that we spoke,"" said Bruna, who is set to become a free agent next season.  ""I can remember everything from that time with him. It is really precious moment for me. ""In football he was always someone I looked up to, I would always try and get little things off him.  ""He was an amazing player and when I met him he was really nice to me. He was like an idol, it's hard to say what he means to me."" "

Easton, a documentary photographer from the UK, was awarded first place in the Portraiture category for his project Bank Top. He collaborated with writer and academic Abdul Aziz Hafiz to examine the representation and misrepresentation of communities in northern England, focusing on a neighbourhood in Blackburn, Lancashire. The project addresses issues of social deprivation, housing, unemployment and immigration, as well as the impact of past and present foreign policy. Mike Trow, chairman of the 2021 Professional competition, said: ""These are not people who necessarily asked to be photographed, but Craig gained their trust.  ""They look frankly to camera and we see a mutual understanding between documenter and subject.  ""It is the moral weight behind this work that makes it so important and deserving of this prize.""  The winners of the Open, Student, and Youth competitions have also been announced, along with the overall winners in each of the Professional competition categories. The Open competition celebrates the power of single images and this year's winner is Tamary Kudita, from Zimbabwe, for her portrait of a young woman dressed in Victorian clothing, holding traditional Shona cooking utensils, called African Victorian. ""It pays tribute to the contemporary being who is also rooted in history,"" she said.  ""A central notion in my work is the importance of African representation, and I am thankful to have received the opportunity to put Zimbabwean art on the map."" Coenraad Heinz Torlage, of the Stellenbosch Academy of Design and Photography, won the student competition for his series Young Farmers. The project explores the challenges of droughts and safety, and debates around land ownership faced by the next generation of South African farmers. The Youth Photographer of the Year award went to 19-year-old Pubarun Basu from India, for his image No Escape from Reality, which uses cage-like shadows behind curtains to convey a sense of entrapment. Tomáš Vocelka, of the Czech Republic, won the Architecture category for his photographs of a former military complex that has been transformed into a pet crematorium. Mark Hamilton Gruchy, from the UK, is the winner in the Creative category for his series of edited Nasa and Jet Propulsion Laboratory images. ""I have repurposed, processed and composited [the images] to create a conversation about the unchanging aspect of the Moon contrasted with the Earth, which continues to be a dynamic place where change cannot be prevented,"" he said. The Documentary category was won by Vito Fusco, of Italy, for his series on Kenya's pyrethrum flowers, which are used as a natural insecticide. ""During the 1980s, the pyrethrum crisis began, instigated by the chemical synthesis of pyrethroids that led to the manufacturing of cheaper but non-organic products,"" he said.  ""The Kenyan government has decided to liberalise the production of pyrethrum, opening it to private companies in an ambitious attempt to revive the sector and help local farmers meet the growing global demand for organic products."" Italy's Simone Tramonte came first in the Environment category with his series Net-zero Transition.  ""In a few decades, [Iceland] moved away from fossil fuels to producing 100% of its electricity from renewable sources.  ""This small nation presents many ways in which the global climate crisis can be tackled and is leading the transition to a net-zero sustainable future."" Silent Neighbourhoods by Majid Hojjati, of Iran, won the Landscape category. ""We have raced to eternity, knowing life is fleeting, leaving the lights on behind us as if to say that once upon a time we were alive.  ""Here are the silent neighbourhoods: those places free of the presence of humanity.  ""The noise of their silence can be heard everywhere - but here in these places we are condemned to hear nothing."" Laura Pannack, from the UK, triumphed in the Portfolio category, with images from a variety of personal projects. ""I believe images need to captivate and evoke emotion, and so, with every frame I shoot, I consider the elements within the frame and outside it."" Anas Alkharboutli won the Sport category with a series titled Sport and Fun Instead of War and Fear. The project documents a karate school near Aleppo, Syria, which aims to help children overcome the traumas of war.  The Still Life winner is Peter Eleveld, from the Netherlands, for his series Still Life Composition, Shot on Wet Plate. ""For this project I used ordinary objects, like glassware, fruits and flowers and applied the wet plate collodion technique to turn them into something extraordinary."" Wildlife and Nature winner Luis Tato, from Spain, photographed desert locusts for a series titled Locust Invasion in East Africa. ""Swarms of desert locusts from the Arabian Peninsula began rampaging across East Africa in early 2020, devouring crop and vegetation where they landed.

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/66406178",NA,NA,NA,NA,"England batter Alex Hales has retired from international cricket.  Hales, 34, made 156 appearances for England across three formats, scoring 5,066 runs and lifting the men's T20 World Cup in November.  He last played for his country in the five-wicket win against Pakistan in that final in Melbourne.  Hales, who will continue to play for Nottinghamshire and in T20 franchises, said it had been ""an absolute privilege"" to represent England. ""I've made some memories and some friendships to last a lifetime and I feel that now is the right time to move on,"" he wrote on Instagram.  Hales is currently playing for Trent Rockets in The Hundred, and is expected to continue being a regular in T20 leagues such as Australia's Big Bash League and the Pakistan Super League.  A short-form specialist, Hales was a key member of England's one-day international side, hitting a six against Australia at Trent Bridge as they broke the record for the highest ODI total in 2018.   He scored 2,419 runs in 70 one-day internationals and 573 in 11 Tests between 2015 and 2016. However, his time with England has not been without controversy.  In 2017, Hales was involved with team-mate Ben Stokes in an incident outside a Bristol nightclub that led to him being charged by the England and Wales Cricket Board and subsequently suspended. Two years later, he served a 21-day ban for reportedly failing a recreational drugs test which led to him being dropped from England's World Cup squad.  His three-year exile ended in September 2022 after he was called up as a replacement for the injured Jonny Bairstow.  Reflecting on his career, he added: ""Throughout my time in an England shirt, I've experienced some of the highest highs as well as some of the lowest lows.  ""It's been an incredible journey and I feel very content that my last game for England was winning a World Cup final. ""Throughout the ups and downs I've always felt a huge amount of support from my friends, family and undoubtedly the best fans in world cricket. ""I look forward to continuing to play for Notts and experiencing more franchise cricket around the world."" England next play a T20 series against New Zealand from 30 August, before they defend their World Cup title in West Indies and the USA next June.  Hales' retirement is likely to give an opportunity for Phil Salt to open the batting - the Lancashire opener has played 16 T20s and 14 ODIs and was also part of the side who won the World Cup last year.  It may also give an opportunity for Somerset opener Will Smeed, 21, with 50-over World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan having previously praised the right-hander."

It was originally thought Mark Vande Hei - who has been in space for 355 days - might be left behind on the ISS due to heightened tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  But it has been confirmed he will travel aboard a Russian capsule to Kazakhstan. The American and two Russian cosmonauts will be brought back to Earth. ""I can tell you for sure Mark is coming home... We are in communication with our Russian colleagues. There's no fuzz on that,"" Joel Montalbano, Nasa's International Space Station (ISS) programme manager said. He admitted the astronauts were ""aware of what's going on"" in the world, but they still work as a team. Under international space law, astronauts from all nations must ""provide all possible help"" to other astronauts when needed, ""including emergency landing in a foreign country or at sea"".  Dmitry Rogozin, chief of the Russian Space Agency Roscosmos, had previously warned about sanctions causing technical issues to the ISS but Mr Montalbano said it had continued to run smoothly.  ""All these activities have continued for 20 years and nothing has changed in the last three weeks. Our control centres operate successfully, flawlessly, seamlessly,"" he said. The US controls power and life support aboard the ISS and Russia controls things such as its propulsion. Earlier this month on Russian state TV, Mr Rogozin announced Roscosmos would halt rocket sales to the US in response to sanctions against Russia. Mr Vande Hei, 55, has now made a new US record for the most time spent in space."

A group of local artists from Bath Art Depot came up with the plans after it was revealed the city's Weston Island site may become available. The Arts Island would become an arts quarter with studios, a gallery, cafe, sculpture park and flea market area on the site.  It is an idea supported by the city's Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse, who agreed ""city leaders should think big"". Explaining the proposal, Nicola Turner from Bath Art Depot said: ""What we'd like to do is a sort of bottom-up development which is along the lines of NDSM in Amsterdam, where you actually start with the existing buildings... and put studio space within that. ""The island has two huge hangars, which could be made available to artists and performers from around the world, as well as creating space for the local community."" Weston Island is currently used as a depot by First Bus, but may become available in the next five years according to Bath and North East Somerset Council's Local Plan Partial Update, which is out for consultation until 8 October. Ms Hobhouse said: ""Let's create something the local communities can embrace and be part of that improves links across the river, bolsters the island's ecology and that attracts international visitors to Bath."" The Arts Island plan is focused on having a low environmental impact through the use of existing buildings and green energy systems. An alternative proposal is for the site to be used for a builders' merchant and Post Office. Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk "

""Obviously I've been waiting three games but to get any minutes for Northern Ireland has been an absolute honour,"" continued Hutton, who said she might look to get into coaching in the future.  ""It's just great to be here. It's been a long slog of a year coming back from an ACL injury.  ""Obviously we'd never qualified before so being at the Euro finals and playing the likes of Norway, Austria and England - you can't get any better than that and you just have to embrace it.""   Hutton made her debut in February 2005, just one year after the senior women's national team reformed after being disbanded at the turn of the century. She played an integral role in Northern Ireland's historic success in reaching Euro 2022.

Hutton, who plays for Linfield in the Women's Premiership, started both play-off matches against Ukraine in 2021 which secured qualification for the finals, however her participation was thrown into doubt when she sustained an ACL injury that May. She returned to action at the start of the Women's Premiership season in April and made her comeback appearance in a pre-Euros warm-up in Belgium.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-57230970","Belarus plane: What impact could tougher action against Belarus have?",2021-06-21,NA,NA,"The EU has agreed to ramp up sanctions against Belarus, following the forced landing of a plane flying over its territory. On 21 June, 78 Belarusian individuals and eight entities were added to the list of people and companies under the EU's travel ban and asset freeze. The EU already bans Belarusian carriers from its airspace and airports.  Further economic sanctions will be considered by the EU leaders when they meet for a two day summit on 24 June.  Around 3,300 flights flew over Belarus last week, according to aircraft tracking website Flightradar24, with 660 of those actually landing in the country. Belarus receives income from airlines that enter its airspace of up to €70,000 (£60,000) each day, according to John Grant from the aviation analytics firm OAG. Losing this amount of money, he says, would be ""an inconvenience"" but would not have a significant impact on the economy of Belarus.  Instead of flying over Belarus, airlines have the option of using Lithuanian or Latvian airspace for example, without adding too much time to a flight so the extra fuel costs incurred would not be great.  Maps showing flight paths show some airlines are now diverting to avoid Belarus. On 27 and 28 May, Russia, a key ally of Belarus, denied entry to its airspace to two European airlines because they planned to avoid flying over Belarus to get to Moscow.  The EU leaders will consider further economic sanctions when they meet for a two day summit on 24 June.   The measures are likely to include action against the export of potash (a common fertilizer ingredient) as well as tobacco industry exports and petroleum products. Belarus has an estimated 20% of the world's reserves of potash and exports of this are one of its major sources of foreign currency. The EU first introduced restrictive measures against Belarus in 2004, following the disappearance of two opposition politicians, a journalist and a businessman several years earlier. These included an arms embargo and a ban on ""the export of goods linked to internal repression"".  The EU imposed more sanctions against Belarus on 1 October 2020, in response to the ""brutality of the Belarusian authorities and in support of the democratic rights of the Belarusian people"".  These restrictions - a travel ban and asset freeze against individuals and entities associated with the government of Alexander Lukashenko -  have since been expanded. As of 21 June, the EU applies the restrictions to a total of 166 persons and 15 entities. Those on the list are forbidden from entering or transiting through EU territories and their assets in the EU are frozen. In addition, EU citizens and companies are forbidden from making funds available to any individual and company on the list The UK expanded its sanctions on 21 June, by adding another 11 people and two entities to its list. The UK's restrictions now target a total of 99 people and nine organisations. The US Treasury Department also said it was expanding the sanctions against Belarus, targeting 16 Belarus individuals and five entities.  The US has had sanctions against Belarus since 2006. These were tightened in 2008 and expanded in October 2020 to 24 individuals, in response to the 9 August presidential election and subsequent crackdown on opposition protests. On 27 May, the G7 group of wealthy nations - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Britain - issued a statement calling for ""accountability for the actions of the Belarusian authorities"" and threatening ""further sanctions as appropriate"".

This could guarantee a ""more equitable"" global circulation of the vaccine, said Rogier Krens chief investment officer of Achmea Investment Management. Drug makers said they are making sure lower income countries have access. Over nine billion doses have been administered worldwide. Mr Krens said that the group of 65 companies, which collectively control almost $3.5tn (£2.59tn) in assets, believes that vaccines are ""not distributed fairly at the moment"".  Overall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with nearly three billion and 1.5 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 500 million. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine. So far the scheme has distributed more than 900 million vaccines. ""What we're asking the companies to do is to tie their remuneration policy and strategy to a more equitable distribution of the vaccine,"" Mr Krens explained.  If they don't commit to a fairer distribution, he said the groups first step will be to vote against any remuneration proposals that don't take this into consideration.  Asked if that means trying to withhold bonuses if the concerns aren't addressed, Mr Krens, replied ""effectively yes"". Figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, show that many of the countries with the lowest vaccination rates are lower income African nations such as Burundi, DR Congo and Chad. Meanwhile, those at the top of the list are wealthier countries such as the UAE, Portugal and Brunei.  Last week the head of the World Health Organisation reiterated the importance of vaccines in ending the pandemic. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu warned against ""narrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding"", and added that if ""we end inequity, we end the pandemic"".  A fairer distribution of vaccines makes sense from both a humanitarian and financial perspective, according to Mr Krens. ""We definitely feel it's our responsibility to invest in companies that act in a socially responsible way,"" he said.  When it comes to the money that the group manages for pension funds and other clients Mr Krens explained that a continuation of the pandemic as it's going now, would be a ""threat"" to the economy and eventually, a threat to their investment returns. The massive gap in vaccination rates between advanced economies and poorer nations could cost the global economy $5.3tn over five years according to the International Monetary Fund.  The group of investors have voiced their concerns in a letter to the boards of Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. In their statement, they highlight the World Health Organisation's roadmap which calls for 70% of the population of every country to be vaccinated by the middle of this year. The roadmap calls on vaccine manufacturers to be more transparent about production schedules and to prioritise contracts with Covax and Avat which aim to improve the distribution of vaccines in poorer countries.  Vaccines makers said they are doing what they can to ensure that doses are spread out fairly. AstraZeneca, which has worked with Oxford University on its vaccine, said it is ""producing its COVID-19 vaccine for no profit to low income countries and has distributed most of its supply to low and middle income countries."" Johnson & Johnson said that approximately 60% its COVID-19 vaccines have been shipped to low and middle income countries and that fair access to them has been ""at the forefront"" of its response to the pandemic. It added that its executive pay strategy ""is designed to promote long-term, sustainable value creation"".  Moderna and Pfizer haven't responded to requests for comment. However last year, in an open letter Pfizer's chief executive Albert Bourla wrote that the biggest restriction on expanding manufacturing was ""scarcity of highly specialised raw materials"". International political efforts to improve vaccine production and distribution through a wavier of intellectual property rights have stalled. Hopes for an agreement at the World Trade Organisation were dented when it's in person Ministerial Conference was abruptly cancelled in late November. Achmea's Rogier Krens believes that such a sharing of the vaccine manufacturing know-how has an important role to play in improving vaccine distribution.  Although they have largely resisted so far he said: ""We're actually calling actively for the pharmaceutical companies to contribute in that area"". He argued that increasing vaccine supply is crucial to getting more people protected from coronavirus.  Mr Krens said that the coalition of investors can bring about change from the drug makers, even if it doesn't happen overnight, because it's size equates to ""quite a strong voice"". "
"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-54073836","Northern Ireland Secretary admits new bill will 'break international law'",2020-09-08,NA,NA,"A government minister has said a new bill to amend the UK's Brexit deal with the EU will ""break international law"". Concerns had been raised about legislation being brought forward which could change parts of the withdrawal agreement, negotiated last year.  Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis conceded it would go against the treaty in a ""specific and limited way"". Former PM Theresa May warned the change could damage ""trust"" in the UK over future trade deals with other states. The permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department, Sir Jonathan Jones, has announced he is resigning from government in light of the bill, making him the sixth senior civil servant to leave Whitehall this year. Sir Jonathan, who is the government's most senior lawyer, is understood to have believed the plans went too far in breaching the government's obligations under international law.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer condemned the bill and accused No 10 of ""reopening old arguments that had been settled"", saying the ""focus should be on getting a [trade] deal done"" with the EU.   No 10 revealed on Monday that it would be introducing a new UK Internal Market Bill that could affect post-Brexit customs and trade rules in Northern Ireland. Downing Street said it would only make ""minor clarifications in extremely specific areas"" - but it worried some in Brussels and Westminster that it could see the government try to change the withdrawal agreement, which became international law when the UK left the EU in January.  The row also comes at the start of the eighth round of post-Brexit trade deal talks between the UK and the EU. The two sides are trying to secure a deal before the end of the transition period on 31 December, which will see the UK going onto World Trade Organisation rules if no agreement is reached.  Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Coveney, called Mr Lewis' comments ""gravely concerning"", adding: ""Any unilateral departure from the terms of the withdrawal agreement would be a matter of considerable concern and a very serious step."" The UK's chief Brexit negotiator, Lord David Frost, called for ""realism"" from his EU counterparts, saying he would ""drive home our clear message that we must make progress this week if we are to reach an agreement in time"". The EU said it would ""do everything in [its] power to reach an agreement"" with the UK, but ""will be ready"" for a no-deal scenario. On Monday, Boris Johnson said if a deal hadn't been done by the time the European Council meets on 15 October, the two sides should ""move on"" and accept the UK's exit without one.  Shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, said it was ""deeply concerning"" that the prime minister ""appeared to be undermining the legal obligations of his own deal"" with the introduction of the new law while the negotiations are taking place.  The text of the new bill will not be published until Wednesday, although the government has confirmed it will deal with the issue of the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol - an element of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland after Brexit.  The practicalities of the protocol - which will deal with issues of state aid (financial support given to businesses by governments) and whether there needs to be customs checks on goods - is still being negotiated by a joint UK and EU committee. But Mr Lewis said the bill would take ""limited and reasonable steps to create a safety net"" if the negotiations failed.  Speaking during an urgent question on the bill, chair of the Justice Committee and Tory MP Bob Neill said the ""adherence to the rule of law is not negotiable"".  He asked Mr Lewis: ""Will he assure us that nothing proposed in this legislation does or potentially might breach international obligations or international legal arrangements?"" The Northern Ireland secretary replied: ""Yes. This does break international law in a very specific and limited way."" He said the government was still working ""in good faith"" with the EU joint committee to overcome its concerns for the future of trade in Northern Ireland, but said there was ""clear precedence for UK and indeed other countries needing to consider their obligations if circumstances change"". Sir Bob later told BBC Radio 4's PM the decision was ""troubling"", adding: ""Britain is a country which prides itself on standing by the rule of law... whether it is inconvenient or convenient for us. ""Whatever we seek to do, if we find something we signed up to 'inconvenient', I am afraid this doesn't mean we can renege on our contract... as that would damage our reputation long term."" This was an extremely unusual statement - a minister standing up in Parliament to say the government is planning to break international law. Brandon Lewis told the House of Commons that ""there are clear precedents for the UK and other countries needing to consider their international obligations as circumstances change"". That may suggest, says Catherine Barnard, professor of law at the University of Cambridge, that the government is looking at Article 62 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which enables a state to get out of its treaty obligations when circumstances change radically.  But those changed circumstances have to be pretty dramatic - something like the dissolution of Yugoslavia, when a recognised country ceases to exist.  In the case of the Northern Ireland Protocol, it is less than a year since the government negotiated the treaty in full knowledge of the sensitivity of the situation.  And if the government does go ahead with legislation which appears to contradict the withdrawal agreement? ""There is a chance,"" says Prof Barnard, ""that the EU will decide to trigger the dispute resolution mechanism in the withdrawal agreement, which could lead to arbitration and a case before the European Court of Justice.""  Theresa May - who stood down as prime minister last year after her own Brexit deal failed to get the support of Parliament - said: ""The United Kingdom government signed the withdrawal agreement with the Northern Ireland Protocol.  ""This Parliament voted that withdrawal agreement into UK legislation. The government is now changing the operation of that agreement."" ""How can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?"" The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, also called it a ""sad and shocking state of affairs for our country"".  Sammy Wilson, who acts as Brexit spokesman for the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, said he was ""pleased"" to have the new bill that could deal with some of the issues that could affect his constituents - such as state aid and customs checks.  But he said the DUP had ""warned ministers of the impact of the withdrawal agreement"" early on, saying it was a ""union splitting, economy destroying and border creating agreement that has to be changed and replaced"". He added: ""We will judge this bill on whether it delivers on these kind of issues."" However, Claire Hanna, a Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MP for Belfast South, said the protocol was ""a symptom… of four years of terrible political decision making"". She added: ""It is now the law. This government is obliged to implement it in full.""  She also ""cautioned"" Mr Lewis ""not to use the threat of a border on the island of Ireland or the hard won impartiality of the Good Friday Agreement as a cat's paw in this or any other negotiation."" But former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, said the act that brought the withdrawal agreement into law in the UK allowed the government to ""reserve the right to make clarifications under the sovereignty clause"".  Mr Lewis agreed, saying the law would ""clarify... the points about what will apply in January if we are not able to get satisfactory and mutually suitable conclusions"" in negotiations. He added: ""It is reasonable and sensible to give that certainty and clarity to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland."""

The IMF's new global forecast is for growth of 5.5% this year and 4.2% in 2022. For the UK, the growth forecast for this year has been lowered to 4.5%. However, the IMF now thinks the UK's contraction last year was not as deep as it had previously estimated. That said, the estimated 10% contraction in the UK was still, according to these IMF figures, the largest of the G7 group of leading rich economies. The global upgrade reflects - in addition to vaccine developments - government spending measures announced towards the end of last year, especially in the United States and Japan. Both are given significant upgrades in the new forecast. Those two economies are predicted to get back to pre-pandemic - that is at the end of 2019 - levels of activity later this year. By contrast, the IMF says activity in Britain and the euro area is likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels into 2022. ""The wide divergence reflects to an important extent differences across countries in behavioural and public health responses to infections, flexibility and adaptability of economic activity to low mobility, pre-existing trends, and structural rigidities entering the crisis,"" the IMF said. The IMF also expects diverging performance among developing countries.  China's containment of the virus and public investment have helped produce a strong recovery. China managed to avoid an economic contraction last year, though its growth rate was sharply down from previous years. There is also a large upward revision to this year's forecast for India. That reflects a stronger than expected bounce back after lockdown measures were eased. But it will be harder for developing economies that rely on tourism or selling oil. Demand for both has been hit very hard by the pandemic and is likely to return to normal slowly. Rich countries are for the most part expected to recover more quickly than developing nations. That reflects their quicker access to vaccines and the fact they have been able to provide what the IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath calls more expansive support. ""With advanced economies generally expected to recover faster, progress made towards convergence over the last decade is at risk of reversing,"" Ms Gopinath says. In spite of the good news on vaccine developments, the report notes lingering concerns -  the surge in infections in late 2020 in some countries (including the UK), renewed lockdowns and logistical issues with the distribution of vaccines. The report says aggressive policies from governments and central banks have helped prevent worse outcomes. It says these measures should remain until vaccines support the start of a return to normal."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56192105","Analysis: Can Asia help Myanmar find a way out of coup crisis?",2021-02-26,"Jonathan Head","BBC News, South East Asia correspondent","The arrival of the Myanmar junta-appointed foreign minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, in Bangkok on Wednesday for an unannounced meeting with his Thai and Indonesian counterparts marked the start of a daunting diplomatic undertaking for South East Asia. No details were released of what was discussed. This first official contact with a senior member of the junta was so delicate that, when asked about it, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha was unwilling to confirm that it had even happened. In fact for every country with an interest in what happens in Myanmar, the crisis presents an unusually thorny challenge. The responses of the world's military and economic superpowers have inevitably drawn most attention; the sanctions imposed by the Biden administration in the United States, and those being prepared by the European Union.  There was a predictably bland statement from China, merely urging all parties to settle their differences peacefully.  But China did back a watered-down UN Security Council statement, which, while it failed to condemn the coup, did call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and a return to democratic norms, showing that China was not happy about the coup. But both the US and China have limited options over how they deal with the Myanmar crisis.  The influence of the US is much diminished in this region, far lower than the last time it imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions in the 1990s. Yet even those sanctions, which helped cripple the Burmese economy, had little influence on the decisions made by the then-ruling junta.  The more limited, targeted sanctions imposed now are intended to hit only those directly involved in the coup and the military's businesses, but will likewise do little to change minds in Nay Pyi Taw. The crisis has come very early in the Biden administration just as it was beginning to formulate a new approach to the Asia-Pacific region, one which is supposed to emphasise democratic values and also working in co-operation with regional partners like the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean). But, like China, Asean will not sign up to an approach based on sanctions and condemnation of the junta. China looks like a winner from the coup, as the one superpower willing to engage with the new regime and keep supplying it with weapons and investment.  However, it is no secret that China was more comfortable dealing with the National League for Democracy (NLD) government, under which relations had been getting warmer, than with an unpredictable military regime which has a deep historical mistrust of its larger neighbour's influence, especially over some armed insurgent groups on their common border. Yet the widespread belief in Myanmar that China is backing the junta is feeding growing anti-Chinese sentiment among the millions now protesting against the coup - so much so that Chinese officials have been forced to break their customary silence and come out to deny rumours that China is helping the military build an internet firewall, or bringing in special forces to help crush the protests.  The passionate opposition to the coup also raises the spectre of longer-term instability in Myanmar, which threatens China's substantial economic and strategic interests there. For all these reasons Beijing will want to tread very carefully. The United Nations has an unhappy record of engagement in Myanmar - the failed missions of several special envoys to promote a democratic opening in the two decades after the 1988 uprising, the largely fruitless efforts of successive human rights rapporteurs, and controversy over the silence of resident UN agencies over the repression of Rohingya leading up to the atrocities and mass exodus of 2017.  The current special envoy, Swiss diplomat Christine Schraner Burgener, has the unenviable task of finding the ingredients for a compromise which might lead Myanmar out of the present dangerous confrontation between the military and the people.  She is seeking a meeting with representatives of the new government as a matter of urgency, but any such meeting would be conditional on her also being able to meet Aung San Suu Kyi, currently detained in an unknown location, and could not be seen to give any formal recognition to the junta.  She will also be coming with a mandate from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has stated that the coup must be made to fail, which will make winning the trust of the generals difficult.  Few believe the coup leader, General Min Aung Hlaing, is ready to discuss giving up the power he has seized.  Some of his subordinates may disagree with the coup, and recognise the huge risks it poses to Myanmar, but the Tatmadaw rarely allows differences of opinion within its ranks to show.  Aung San Suu Kyi, whose renowned intractability helped her weather 15 years of house arrest, may be no more inclined to compromise than the man who deposed her.  The way the coup has poisoned the ground for any compromise was illustrated by the fate of Indonesia's efforts this week to start an Asean initiative on Myanmar. With Myanmar as a member, and bound by its customary consensus-based decision making and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs, Asean has particular challenges in addressing this crisis. But it must, as further confrontation and bloodshed in Myanmar would have serious repercussions for the stability and reputation of the association, and in particular for countries like Thailand which share long borders.  Thai authorities are already making preparations for the possibility of large numbers of people fleeing across the border. Asean is not speaking with one voice on Myanmar.  Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and initially even the Philippines, once the most liberal member state on human rights and democracy, have all refused to criticise the coup, describing it as an internal matter.  Singapore, the biggest foreign investor in Myanmar, has been stronger in its statements, expressing ""grave concern"" and describing the use of lethal force against protesters as ""inexcusable"".  It is Indonesia, Asean's largest country with a past history of taking the leading role in resolving issues like the Cambodian conflict in the 1980s, which has stepped up to try to find a path out of the crisis in Myanmar.  Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, more than six years in the job, is among the most experienced in the region, and was active in seeking solutions to the Rohingya crisis four years ago.  Indonesia is distant from Myanmar, sharing no borders nor holding any great economic or strategic stakes in what happens there.  And as another large, multi-ethnic, post-colonial state in which the armed forces played a central role in nation-building, Indonesia has sometimes been viewed by the generals in Myanmar as something of a model. However, when Ms Marsudi began exploring the possibility of holding a special Asean meeting on Myanmar, details of the proposals being discussed with other member states were leaked - in particular the idea of holding the junta to its promise of a new election within a year, and insisting that Aung San Suu Kyi and other NLD politicians be released and allowed to contest.  As a compromise, that idea makes some sense.  But it enraged anti-military protesters in Myanmar, who argue that last November's election overwhelmingly won by the NLD must be honoured, and that backing a new election rewards the military for overturning the results of the last one and will only encourage them to mount further coups.  Ms Marsudi's planned trip to Nay Pyi Taw was quickly shelved. For all of its weaknesses, Asean remains the one forum where senior Burmese officials will be welcomed, and where channels of communication remain open.  It may be best placed to facilitate passing messages to the generals from the rest of the world, and hearing back from them their thoughts on how to resolve the crisis. The sanctions applied by western countries will not move the generals much at this stage, but their removal could be used as the carrot to induce the Tatmadaw into moving away from confrontation and repression.  Engagement by Myanmar's Asian neighbours will not move the notoriously xenophobic generals much either, but if well-coordinated with the pressure applied by the West, it might produce positive results.  The military men who still dominate the government in Thailand have an opportunity here to show statesmanship, and to use their close personal ties to Min Aung Hlaing to explore possible openings.  China's influence will also be critical.  Will it sit back, and wait to see if the military crushes the protest movement, and then resume business as usual, or will it join the search for a negotiated way out?  China has yet to reveal its hand in this fiendishly complex diplomatic game."

A joint letter urges organisers to put pressure on Baillie Gifford over its investment in fossil fuels. The festival director later called for an ""open discussion"" about the issue during the event, which starts on Saturday. Baillie Gifford has said it is not a significant investor in the sector. Zadie Smith, Ali Smith and Gary Younge are among those who have signed the open letter ahead of the literary festival. It comes after climate activist Greta Thunberg last week cancelled an appearance at the event.  The authors of the letter expressed solidarity with those harmed by the climate crisis, including people in the global south and in the UK, who have lost their homes, livelihoods and been forced to migrate.  They also highlighted the injustice of corporate greed and profit from the fossil fuel industry at a time when millions across the UK suffer from fuel poverty and the cost of living crisis. Edinburgh-based author Mikaela Loach, who is due to appear at the event, said organisers ""must stand by their 'climate positive' commitment and drop Baillie Gifford as a sponsor."" She added: ""Edinburgh International Book Festival wouldn't burn books, so why are they ok with burning the planet?"" Novelist Yara Rodrigues Fowler added recent global wildfires, flooding and extreme heat showed the destruction being caused by the fossil fuel industry.  She said the book festival was giving companies like Baillie Gifford a ""social licence"" to continue funding ""the destruction of our only home"". Festival director Nick Barley thanked the writers for the letter and described them as ""the lifeblood of this festival"".  He added: ""We fully acknowledge your concerns about the devastating impact of fossil fuel exploitation on the climate: as individuals and as a charity we firmly agree.  ""For these reasons we promise to think about your letter carefully. The last thing we want is to let anyone give the impression we are on opposite sides."" However Mr Barley warned the arts organisation would not have enough funds to operate without private sponsorship.  He also said Baillie Gifford was investing in companies that were seeking to resolve the crisis, such as Danish windfarm specialist, Ørsted. Mr Barley urged the writers to discuss their concerns during the festival and vowed he would ""keep a open mind"" about how to proceed. He added: ""Let's talk in the Authors' Yurt, in the bookshop, in the cafe and in the festival courtyard.  ""Let's talk in our theatres too: I'd like to find a time when we can invite representatives from across the spectrum of opinion to come on stage and have a discussion which will be open to the public.  ""We'll find a date when that's possible and you'd be more than welcome to join us."" Greta Thunberg had been due to speak at an event called It's Not Too Late To Change The World at the Edinburgh Playhouse but pulled out after accusing the sponsors of ""greenwashing"". Baillie Gifford, which has sponsored the book festival for 19 years, said 2% of its clients' money invested in companies with some business related to fossil fuels compared to a market average of 11%. The Ferret reported last month that Baillie Gifford had billions invested in firms that profit from fossil fuels. A spokesperson for the firm previously said: ""Of those companies, some have already moved most of their business away from fossil fuels, and many are helping to drive the transition to clean energy. ""Currently, 5% of our clients' money is invested in companies whose sole purpose is to develop clean energy solutions."" The Edinburgh International Book Festival runs from 12-28 August, alongside the Fringe.  The 2023 event will feature over 500 events and 550 authors."

It is home to the core of the submarine service, including the UK's nuclear deterrent, and the new generation of hunter-killer submarines.  As well as the ""rolling"" strike action among Babcock workers, there will be a continuous call-out ban and ban on all overtime.

For 2021 and 2022, the offer was based on the consumer price index, plus 0.5%.

""However, the company has taken the deliberate decision to escalate this dispute by refusing to meaningfully engage with us on pay and the future workplace relations at the bases."" In a statement, Babcock said it was ""deeply disappointed"" that some union members at HNMB (Her Majesty's Naval Base) Clyde had chosen to take action over a pay claim, ""when we have been clear that we are keen to try to find a mutually acceptable resolution"".   The company said: ""We increased our offer during talks with Unite at the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) and believe this is a very fair pay deal that is higher than the rate of inflation.

The three-day Night Light event was due to take place over the first weekend of the festival at the beginning of August. A group of French artists who were working on the Royal Botanic Garden show cannot make it to the capital due to quarantine restrictions. Scottish traditional musicians were also due to work at the free show. France is currently on the UK government's amber list for restrictions, meaning people have to isolate for 10 days after arrival in Scotland and take two Covid tests.   Preparation for the show, which involved fire sculptures and a large scale fire walk, required the performers to arrive seven weeks in advance.  All other shows at the festival are unaffected by the cancellation. Three temporary venues are being created at Edinburgh Park, Edinburgh University's Old College Quad and Edinburgh Academy Junior School's playing fields. An Edinburgh International Festival spokeswoman said: ""Regretfully we have had to cancel the Aberdeen Standard Investments Opening Event: Night Light scheduled for 6-8 August. ""Without the previously available artists travel exemption from quarantine, it is not logistically feasible for the Carabosse creative team to travel from France to Edinburgh to undertake the necessary preparatory work, which needs to be completed seven weeks before the event itself."" Paul Bush, VisitScotland's director of events, said: ""Since its inception in 2015, the opening event of the Edinburgh International Festival has captured the imagination of festival goers and opened it up to a whole new audience. ""Despite the best efforts of all involved, it is regrettable the festival is having to cancel this year's Aberdeen Standard Investments opening event, Night Light."""

The collective, Isle, will focus on exploring the interaction between people and the environment around them. It comprises Celine Marchbank, Hanna-Katrina Jędrosz, Lynda Laird and Nicola Muirhead, who all studied photojournalism and documentary photography at the London College of Communication. The pictures on show are from their long-form documentary series and include photographs made on the British Isles, across Europe and the United States. Grace Notes explores the landscapes and isolated communities of North America's New Hampshire and Vermont.  Guided by the myth and folklore of the countryside and the strange history surrounding these two states, the work was inspired by the poems of Robert Frost, and his Pulitzer Prize winning book, New Hampshire: A Poem with Notes and Grace Notes, written in the White Mountains of New Hampshire during the 1920s.  Dans le noir is based on the diary entry of Odette Brefort, a young member of the French Resistance in Deauville, from 6 June 1944, the day of the D-Day landings.   The images of the surveillance bunkers along the Normandy coast were taken on infrared film, a technology employed by the military to penetrate camouflage.  A Stranger in my Mother's Kitchen documents the photographer's process of grief, through the things her mother left behind.  Sue had been a head chef in London and so Celine learned to make the dishes in the recipes that were boxed away, and travelled in her mother's footsteps across America as well as returning to Italy, where they had lived together for a time.  Built in 1963, Skrunda-1 is a former Soviet military town in Latvia entirely deserted since 1998. Two nearby Dnepr radars nearby enabled surveillance of the West and objects in space.

Broadland District Council planning committee unanimously approved the application to develop the site - roughly the size of 37 rugby pitches - near Norwich Airport. The Broadway Enterprise Park will be used for offices and industrial warehouses and the developer said it would create 1,000 jobs.  Concerns were raised about more office space with people still hybrid working.  The plans for the site, which covers 92 acres (372,311sq/m), also include a filling station, two drive-through restaurants, a car showroom and a park and ride development. At the planning meeting, Conservative councillor John Fisher questioned the need for a 1,000-space park and ride with another site currently less than two miles away. Mr Fisher said: ""At the moment you can park anywhere in Norwich - every car park is half empty. ""With the developments of Covid and people not travelling to work as they used to, what would be the alternative?,"" he said.  An officer said there was a ""degree of uncertainty"" to the park and ride and if it did not happen an alternative use would be found for the land. Ahead of the meeting, Norwich City Council objected to the plan, arguing that having office space out of the city could undermine the centre. Comments were also received from three residents, who argued the development was out of keeping with the rural area, reported the Local Democracy Reporting Service.  Paul Knowles, director of Building Partnerships, the group behind the plans, said the scheme would deliver the council's employment and economic development aspirations in the area. Mr Knowles said they expected only about 10% of the employment space would be used for offices, partly because of Covid reducing demand. The exact layout and uses of the park are expected in future applications, although a recycling centre has already been built on the site by Norfolk County Council.

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49693826",NA,NA,NA,NA,"For most non-league players, football is a part-time career filled with long journeys, late finishes and early starts for work the next morning. The professional game - with its manicured pitches, money and media attention - can seem a distant dream. Three years ago, Darren Lok was working shifts in an NHS psychiatric hospital in the south of England and playing part-time football for National League South side Eastbourne Borough, two steps below the English Football League. But now, after being contacted by an agent who read an interview he gave to a football magazine, the Sussex-born forward is a Malaysia international playing for a club competing in the Asian Champions League and could feature for his country in World Cup qualifying. ""I was contacted on the internet by Scott Ollerenshaw, who is now my agent,"" says 28-year-old Lok. ""He asked if I had ever thought about playing football in Malaysia. ""We met a few months later and he explained it in more detail and told me I would be eligible for a Malaysian passport through my father, and that if I moved I could have the chance to represent Malaysia at international level. ""Every non-league player knows how hard it is to juggle work with football, and to have the chance to focus on my football was really appealing. ""I didn't realise how big football in Malaysia was, but after giving it plenty of thought I decided it was too big an opportunity to turn down and one that I would regret if I did not take."" Malaysia are looking to make their mark on the international scene and see players with dual nationality as a way to do that. There is a cap on foreign players in the domestic league, so Lok had to apply for a passport, making him a Malaysian citizen. After a successful trial he joined Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) - the team currently top of the Malaysia Super League - and signed for JDT II, who play in the second tier Malaysia Premier League. JDT are the biggest club in Malaysia and one of the biggest in South East Asia. They have facilities and a following that could rival most Premier League teams and have 700,000 followers on social media platform Instagram., external Their growth and appearance in the Asian Champions League for the first time this year is largely down to their owner, Tunku Ismail Idris, who is a member of the royal family. ""He is the reason the club is where it is today,"" says Lok, whose progress has been hampered by a series of injuries, which led to him being sent to a doctor - used by Manchester City - in Barcelona. ""The owner is extremely passionate and supportive, and has a great vision for the club moving forward. He is very well connected in the football world and is close friends with Peter Lim [owner of Valencia and co-owner of Salford City]. ""Many players have visited the club since I have been here - David Beckham, Robert Pires, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Alessandro Nesta and Hernan Crespo just to name a few."" For Lok - who has a sponsorship deal to go with his professional status - adapting to life on the pitch was as challenging as the new environment he encountered off it. ""The culture is very different and in terms of the football, the climate and the pitches took a long time to get used to,"" he says. ""It's a tropical country where temperatures tend to be 35-40 degrees all year round. The majority of pitches here are cow grass, the ball rolls a lot slower and that took time to adjust to."" Lok's first international call-up did not take long to come and he made his debut against Singapore after being involved in just two league games for JDT II, scoring his first goal for the national team against Syria in 2017. ""My first international cap came a lot sooner than I expected,"" he says. ""It was a big shock - only a few months earlier I'd been playing non-league football in England and now I would be representing Malaysia at international level. It was a great experience.  ""It was a crazy few months. It was things like having to do media interviews that I had to get used to - it was all new to me. Also all the games were televised. That's normal for experienced pros but coming from non-league it was all completely new to me. ""My debut for Malaysia was also the first big crowd I'd played in front of, it was about 20,000. It was surreal having played in front of crowds of 500 people in England."" Unlike Eastbourne Borough, JDT have a branded plane and team bus to transport them to matches played all over the country. They also have a group of fanatical supporters who travel to every game. They are also the first Malaysian side to win six consecutive league titles and because of their participation in the Asian Champions League they've been included on this year's Pro Evolution Soccer game.  Literally and metaphorically, it is miles away from what Lok was used to in England. ""If it all works out well I could be there for as long as I can continue to play football,"" he says."

His second novel, At Night All Blood is Black, was inspired by his great-grandfather's silence about his experiences in World War One. The £50,000 prize will be split between Diop and the book's translator - US author and poet Anna Moschovakis. It fended off competition from five other shortlisted titles, including Éric Vuillard's The War of the Poor. The International Booker Prize is awarded every year for a single book that is translated into English and published in the UK or Ireland. This year's winning entry, by the French-Senegalese writer and literature professor, portrays a young man's descent into madness, and tells the story of the Senegalese who fought for France during the conflict. ""More than a century after World War One, a great new African writer is asking these questions in a spare yet extraordinary novel about this bloody stain on human history,"" said The New York Times in its review. The Star Tribune said: ""Though short, it is an immersive, propulsive read, one that searingly evokes the terrors of trench warfare, the relentless loss of life, and the irreparable damage inflicted on the human soul."" Speaking to the BBC recently, Diop said of his great-grandfather: ""He never said anything to his wife, or to my mother, about his experience. That is why I was always very interested by all the tales and accounts which gave one access to a form of intimacy with that particular war."" The book was announced as the winner by the chair of the judges Lucy Hughes-Hallett, during a virtual celebration at Coventry Cathedral on Wednesday afternoon. ""This story of warfare and love and madness has a terrifying power,"" said Hughes-Hallet. ""The protagonist is accused of sorcery, and there is something uncanny about the way the narrative works on the reader. ""We judges agreed that its incantatory prose and dark, brilliant vision had jangled our emotions and blown our minds. That it had cast a spell on us.""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-14073107",NA,NA,NA,NA,"There are two big questions for James Murdoch, the chairman of News International, who tonight announced the closure of the News of the World. The first is whether he sacrificed a business, and the career prospects of the News of the World's staff, to protect a particularly valued employee: Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International. Presumably, no-one will think that he did that in a conscious, deliberate way. But the sharpest critics of the malpractices at the News of the World, such as the Labour leader Ed Miliband, have been calling for her head. None of those critics, to my knowledge, were demanding that the News of the World should be shut. So it is at least plausible that if Rebekah Brooks had resigned in the past 24 hours, some of the popular and political fury towards News International and the News of the World would have been assuaged. The second question is whether the closure of the News of the World will be seen by the media regulator, Ofcom, as making News Corporation, parent company of News International, a more or less fit-and-proper owner of British Sky Broadcasting, the UK's biggest television business (it is Ofcom's statutory duty to adjudicate on that important issue). On the one hand, James Murdoch can say that the rot within his organisation has tonight been cut out. On the other hand, he has admitted in a remarkable statement that he and his father Rupert Murdoch failed to identify that the News of the World's newsroom was out of control for many years. And even when evidence started to emerge in 2006 that the News of the World was obtaining stories in illicit ways, it took four more years for News International to identify the extent of what went wrong. So some will say that this long inability to get to grips with the malaise at the News of the World means that News Corporation, a sprawling global empire, needs to demonstrate that it can exercise rather closer and more diligent control over a business, British Sky Broadcasting, that is vastly bigger and more important to the cultural life of the UK than the News of the World."

It suggested a temporary increase in taxes on wealth or high incomes could help tackle inequalities that have widened due to the crisis. In its fiscal report, it added the move would help the worst affected by the pandemic feel a sense of cohesion. But the organisation urged governments to ""carefully assess trade-offs"". The International Monetary Fund (IMF) pointed to the reform of current policies on inheritance taxes or property, for example, before turning to wealth taxes. ""To help meet pandemic-related financing needs, policymakers could consider a temporary Covid-19 recovery contribution, levied on high incomes or wealth,"" the report said. ""To accumulate the resources needed to improve access to basic services, enhance safety nets, and reinvigorate efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals, domestic and international tax reforms are necessary, especially as the recovery gains momentum,"" it said. A wealth tax typically targets the assets owned by taxpayers, such as property or investments. Its use has declined in recent decades. The Wealth Tax Commission in the UK last year found that a one-off wealth tax at a rate of 5% over £500,000 per individual would raise £260bn in the UK. It warned that an annual wealth tax would be harder to deliver as rich individuals were likely to change their behaviour to avoid being squeezed. Vitor Gaspar, the director of the IMF's fiscal affairs department, added: ""Pre-existing inequalities have amplified the adverse impact of the pandemic. And, in turn, Covid-19 has aggravated inequalities. A vicious cycle of inequality could morph into a social and political seismic crack."" It said during the pandemic, younger and poorer people had suffered most, being at greater risk of losing their jobs or incomes. In the lender of last resort's recent economic outlook report, it forecasted a stronger economic recovery than expected, both globally and in the UK, than it had done in January. It expects, however, that recoveries will diverge dangerously within and between countries too. Countries with slower vaccine rollouts, more limited support from economic policy, and those more reliant on tourism are likely to do less well."

""We have to tackle the competitiveness gaps"" in the 16-nation eurozone, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said. France and Germany plan to present new proposals to address the problem. But they did not pledge new bail-out cash. The leaders were speaking after an EU summit which saw agreement on a permanent mechanism to help any eurozone nation crippled by debts. The UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, insisted that the new stability mechanism, planned to enter into force in 2013, ""doesn't affect the UK and doesn't transfer any more powers to the European Union"". Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said the discussions ""showed that we need more uniformity in our economic policies, and we will have to talk more about that in the coming months"". The European Council President, Herman Van Rompuy, said EU leaders ""have... the political will to do whatever is required to ensure the eurozone's stability"". This year debt-laden Greece and the Irish Republic have received emergency bail-outs, disbursed jointly by the EU and International Monetary Fund. The 27 leaders, meeting in Brussels on Thursday, agreed that in 2013 the permanent mechanism would succeed the eurozone's 750bn-euro (£637bn; $1tn) temporary bail-out fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). But the summit conclusions, external on Friday noted that ""only a very limited amount has been committed from the EFSF to support the Irish programme"". Analysts say the EFSF would not be big enough to bail out Spain, if Madrid's finances deteriorated to the point where it needed a rescue. Setting up the new stability mechanism requires a change to the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Two sentences will be added to Article 136 of the treaty - a change that Germany demanded to make any future eurozone bail-out legally watertight. The new text, quoted by Mr Van Rompuy, says: ""The member states whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism, to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. ""The granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality.""  The ""strict conditionality"" means that any eurozone country requiring such a rescue will have to act to tackle its debt or deficit. The new mechanism will require private sector bondholders to share the cost of any debt restructuring on a case-by-case basis, Reuters news agency reports. The summit comes amid continuing concern about stability in the eurozone, as national debts and deficits have soared above the EU's targets. Portugal and Spain have been under financial market scrutiny since the Irish Republic was forced to take an aid package of 85bn euros (£72bn; $113bn) last month.  The European Central Bank (ECB) has been buying billions of euros of sovereign debt to ease the pressure on the countries seen as most vulnerable in the eurozone.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-12020200",NA,NA,NA,NA,"EU leaders say they are looking at ways to narrow the economic performance gaps that threaten the eurozone's stability. ""We have to tackle the competitiveness gaps"" in the 16-nation eurozone, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said. France and Germany plan to present new proposals to address the problem. But they did not pledge new bail-out cash. The leaders were speaking after an EU summit which saw agreement on a permanent mechanism to help any eurozone nation crippled by debts. The UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, insisted that the new stability mechanism, planned to enter into force in 2013, ""doesn't affect the UK and doesn't transfer any more powers to the European Union"". Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said the discussions ""showed that we need more uniformity in our economic policies, and we will have to talk more about that in the coming months"". The European Council President, Herman Van Rompuy, said EU leaders ""have... the political will to do whatever is required to ensure the eurozone's stability"". This year debt-laden Greece and the Irish Republic have received emergency bail-outs, disbursed jointly by the EU and International Monetary Fund. The 27 leaders, meeting in Brussels on Thursday, agreed that in 2013 the permanent mechanism would succeed the eurozone's 750bn-euro (£637bn; $1tn) temporary bail-out fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). But the summit conclusions, external on Friday noted that ""only a very limited amount has been committed from the EFSF to support the Irish programme"". Analysts say the EFSF would not be big enough to bail out Spain, if Madrid's finances deteriorated to the point where it needed a rescue. Setting up the new stability mechanism requires a change to the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Two sentences will be added to Article 136 of the treaty - a change that Germany demanded to make any future eurozone bail-out legally watertight. The new text, quoted by Mr Van Rompuy, says: ""The member states whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism, to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. ""The granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality.""  The ""strict conditionality"" means that any eurozone country requiring such a rescue will have to act to tackle its debt or deficit. The new mechanism will require private sector bondholders to share the cost of any debt restructuring on a case-by-case basis, Reuters news agency reports. The summit comes amid continuing concern about stability in the eurozone, as national debts and deficits have soared above the EU's targets. Portugal and Spain have been under financial market scrutiny since the Irish Republic was forced to take an aid package of 85bn euros (£72bn; $113bn) last month.

Since the collapse of the initial idea in October 2021, Juventus along with Real Madrid and Barcelona have stuck to the general principles of the plan. That included a focus on clubs taking a leading role in organising competitions instead of European governing body Uefa. However, Juventus have now broken ranks. They have written to Real and Barca to demand talks which, they say, will centre around ""the potential Juventus exit from the Super League Project"". In a complicated statement, Juventus say they will continue with further communications ""due under the law"" following the talks and their assessment of them. It has been felt they were hoping for a favourable ruling from the European Courts of Justice around whether Uefa are entitled to hold a monopoly over their position as a competition organiser and threaten to exclude clubs who set up rival competitions. It has been a turbulent few months for Juventus, who were initially docked 15 points by the Italian FA for financial rule breaches. This punishment was overturned but a second hearing led to a 10-point penalty, which the club accepted. On Sunday, former player Paulo Dybala scored a last-minute goal for Roma that sealed a Europa League place at Juventus' expense. The Turin giants finished seventh and will enter the Europa Conference League. Without the 10 point deduction, they would have qualified for the Champions League at the expense of AC Milan."

Foreign ministers will use a London summit to commit to helping women in developing countries with a $15bn (£10.8bn) two-year package of support. At their first in-person meeting for two years, they will also agree to help 20 million more girls read by age 10. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said educating girls was a smart investment. He added that the new targets would help ensure 12 years of continuous education for young women and transform ""the fortunes not just of individuals, but whole communities and nations"". Charities have welcomed the pledge - but said it was at odds with the UK's decision to cut its overseas aid spending. The UK government announced last year it would cut UK aid spending from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% - a reduction of more than £4bn. It has yet to confirm which programmes will be affected. ""We know the reality of these aid cuts,"" said Gwen Hines from Save the Children. ""Life-changing, life-saving support [is] being pulled from families in the middle of a pandemic from schooling, medicine and food. ""I just don't see how that is global leadership at a time when the UK is hosting the G7 summit."" The UK holds the rotating presidency of the G7 group, which also includes the US, France, Germany, Canada, Japan and Italy, and will host a summit of leaders in Cornwall next month. Mr Raab will meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken later to discuss trade, Iran and China, as part of a three-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers in London.  The collective agreement on girls' education, which will be formally signed on Wednesday and also includes the EU, aims to put ""gender equality at the heart of global co-operation to build back better"" from Covid, the government said. Women make up more than two-thirds of the world's 796 million illiterate people, according to the United Nations. The UN said 39% of girls in rural areas attend secondary school worldwide - fewer than rural boys (45%), urban girls (59%) and urban boys (60%). It was estimated that, before the pandemic worsened education outcomes, 90% of children in low income countries were unable to read a simple text by age 10. As part of the funding, there will be renewed support for women-led businesses, and for products or services that particularly benefit women and support their empowerment. The government said the G7 nations would also ""recommit to collective action to defend and protect sexual and reproductive health and rights for all"" and ""scale up gender-based violence prevention and elimination"". The G7 announcement comes amid criticism over the UK's cut to aid spending. The Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) has been accused of going back on a promise to continue funding for UN family planning projects aimed at helping women and girls. The UN Population Fund - which helps provide contraceptives and maternal health care for millions of women - said the UK pledged £154m for its projects, but then said it would instead receive about £23m. It has also been criticised for the timing of a planned cut in bilateral funding for clean water and sanitation projects. Annette Zera, who works for an education charity helping girls working as domestic servants in Bangladesh, said the aid authorities ""have just let us down"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that their project ""is going to have to stop"" because it will no longer receive the grant it expected. Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said ""there will always be, sadly, individual projects we are not able to support"". ""We are experiencing a once in a 300-year - the worst in 300 years - economic contraction as a direct result of coronavirus,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme as he defended the cuts. ""We have to make the decisions in keeping with those economic circumstances."" He said the UK remained one of the world's leading aid donors and that the reduction in aid spending to 0.5% of national income would be ""temporary""."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24874578",NA,NA,NA,NA,"It could be a cultural breakthrough - an EU-wide chain of restaurants that puts Roma hospitality, food and music centre-stage, building relations with a much-maligned community. But plans to set up the first link in this chain are in jeopardy, and ethnic relations have soured, after a Slovenian local council stepped in to prevent the first restaurant from opening. There are Roma-owned or Roma-run restaurants elsewhere in the EU, but the restaurant in Maribor , externalwould have been the first to use the Roma theme as its starting point. The restaurant's menu would give a Gypsy twist on dishes found in South-East Europe, such as dolma, burek, goulash and baklava. It would also offer diners a tea leaf reading of the future - the origin of its logo, an upturned cup. The EU-backed social enterprise also hoped the cultural immersion might improve inter-ethnic relations, while providing employment for Roma, who suffer unusually high levels of economic hardship. ""If an employer in Maribor sees you are Roma you will not get a job,"" says 37-year-old Bayram Mehmeti, the restaurant's prospective waiter. His parents moved to Maribor from Kosovo 30 years ago. Mr Mehmeti was among many Kosovo Roma families who moved at around the same time to find work in Maribor's then-thriving industry. But industrial collapse means Roma unemployment is now estimated at 97%, compared to the average of 18%. Slovenia, a small Alpine country, joined the EU in 2004 - the first ex-Yugoslav state to do so. Like most of its partners in the eurozone it has suffered in the financial crisis.  The restaurant project has already provided training for 23 Roma, five of whom were chosen to join the staff should it manage to open its doors in February. The plan is to reinvest profits to employ more staff and expand elsewhere in the EU. But the plan was thrown into jeopardy last month, when a community council stopped the restaurant from moving into a vacant pizza restaurant. The premises had been promised by Maribor's mayor, Andrej Fistravec. The blocking move was ""obvious xenophobia"", says Mr Fistravec, a sociologist before being elected mayor in March. The city's 3,500 Roma feel let down, says representative Fatmir Beciri, a Maribor resident for the past 35 years.  ""I am very sad about this dispute. It is not just a restaurant, it is an opportunity for Roma to get employment,"" he said. Having been promised the job of assistant chef Devrije Mazrek, 53, out of work for the past 15 years, says the setback is depressing.  ""It put me in a very bad mood. I can't understand why we didn't get the location,"" she said. Mr Mehmeti said he had been proud his daughter could tell her nursery friends about him starting work as a waiter. Mr Fistravec blames his predecessor as mayor, Franc Kangler, for promising the community council the right to decide the building's fate before he resigned in December, having been the target of a series of anti-corruption protests. It is unclear how the legal tussle over the building will be resolved. The community council denies having anything against a Roma restaurant, but opposes it because it conflicts with its own plans to turn the building into a community centre for all ages.  Critics say the council plan is unfeasible and a smokescreen for residents' antipathy to Roma, which comments about the story in Slovenian online media suggest are widely shared. ""Their [Roma] behaviour is catastrophic,"" says a middle-aged Slovenian woman privately. ""Even the children behave badly, they spit and talk mean. The adults drive around with unregistered cars. They steal and they don't even think of working, especially the women."" According to Mr Fistravec: ""Slovenians are outwardly tolerant until they personally get in contact with other ethnic groups"". The Slovenian debate over Roma, he says, has evolved into something akin to the ""Jewish question"". ""We are shocked. We did not feel this hatred before,"" says Mr Beciri."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67207375","Axiom Space: Plan to send all-UK astronaut mission into orbit",2023-10-25,"Jonathan Amos","Science correspondent•@BBCAmos","Four UK astronauts could soon be heading into orbit on an all-British mission. An American company that organises visits to the International Space Station (ISS) is developing the plan. Houston-based Axiom has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK Space Agency to try to make it happen. The project would probably cost £200m or more, but the idea is that it would be funded commercially. There would be no contribution from UK taxpayers. Axiom told the BBC that conversations with corporations and institutions interested in providing finance were already under way. The last UK individual to go into orbit was Tim Peake, who flew to the ISS as a European Space Agency (Esa) astronaut in 2015. ""This is an exciting opportunity and actually unique,"" he commented. ""No-one has done a 'national mission', commercially, like this before. It's a new model and would be paving the way for how we do space in the future."" Details are sparse at the moment. No crew has been chosen, nor is there a concept yet for how it would be selected. And neither has the destination been fixed.  Currently, all Axiom-organised missions have used capsules belonging to entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX company to take participating astronauts to the ISS.  But the British mission could also be a free-flyer. That's to say, the crew would spend a number of days circling the Earth in just their capsule, conducting scientific experiments and performing outreach, before then returning to a splashdown on Earth. Were the mission to visit the ISS, the US space agency (Nasa) would insist on certain conditions, one of which would be the inclusion in the crew of a seasoned astronaut. Very few UK passport-holders meet this criterion, with Tim Peake himself being an obvious candidate for commander. Axiom, which was founded by a former Nasa official in charge of the ISS, has so far operated two missions, with a third set to blast off in the New Year. These early ventures have provided flight opportunities for high-net-worth individuals and for government-funded astronauts who are not part of the station's regular crew rotations. But if the new space economy in low-Earth orbit is to develop sustainably, it has to move beyond just billionaires and government funds. It has to pull in sectors that traditionally have not been involved in space activity. Axiom's chief revenue officer, Tejpaul Bhatia, commended the UK Space Agency (UKSA) for its forward-looking strategy. The agency has put an emphasis on seeding private backing for a wave of new space companies.    ""The UK is in a very unique position right now and in a leadership position for this transition to the commercialisation of space,"" Mr Bhatia told BBC News. Axiom doesn't need the patronage of the UKSA; it could simply organise the mission on its own. But having the backing of the agency gives the project further assurance. ""It's a really complex endeavour to plan a space mission, to make sure that the crew are well selected and well trained, and that everything of course is safe. We will have a core role in this, along with Esa where some of the training will be done,"" said UKSA chief executive Paul Bate. ""There's also the science we want to see done on the mission itself, and we have a lot of expertise in selecting microgravity experiments, looking at signs of aging for example.  ""But what I really like about this approach is it's got the commercial nature to it, which is at the heart of what the UK Space Agency does."" Precisely when an ""Axiom-UK"" mission would launch is not clear. The financing has to be secured, and the mission profile fully mapped. Also, if it does go to the space station, Nasa only has a limited number of slots available per year to accept commercial visitors - although it charges handsomely for the opportunity, with ""board and lodging"" priced well above £100,000 a night per individual. Axiom will soon begin attaching modules to the ISS that will eventually then uncouple as a separate architecture to form a commercial station when the veteran orbiting lab is decommissioned. Much of the hardware for this enterprise is being manufactured in Italy at Thales Alenia Space, who built most of the habitable areas on the current space station. The strong links between Axiom and Europe resulted this year in the company also signing a memorandum of understanding with Esa. European member states see Axiom as a way to get more of their citizens into orbit, given the limited number of ISS flight opportunities that come directly to Esa by virtue of its membership of the space station project.  Hungary, Sweden, Poland and Italy are all pursuing the Axiom alternative. Although, unlike the proposed UK mission, these nations will use public money to finance the trips. ""We are right now in a phase where we really have to prepare for the post-ISS period in low-Earth orbit; and this is a request also from our member states,"" said Daniel Neuenschwander, Esa's director of human and robotic exploration. ""You know that the commitment to the exploitation of the ISS has been extended by [European research ministers] until 2030. We'll have to see what comes afterwards,"" he told BBC News."

William Kenyon-Slaney would have been better known at the time as a Colonel in the Grenadier Guards, and later as the MP for Newport, Shropshire. But his home town of Shifnal believes the goal's 150th anniversary should be celebrated and a church has worked with his family to mark the occasion. His relatives said they were ""thrilled"" at the interest in his achievement. William Kenyon-Slaney was born in Rajkot, India, in 1847, and was the son of a British cavalry captain. The family moved to Shropshire when he was a child and he went to school at Eton, aged 13. His great-grandson Rupert Kenyon-Slaney said: ""From the very, very, beginning he displayed an extraordinary aptitude at football.  ""From his very first term he was playing in his house team with 18-year-olds."" His sporting triumphs were documented by the school, including a victory in the House Cup in a team which included his friend Hubert Parry, who would later compose the music for Jerusalem.  He took his love of football and cricket to the Grenadier Guards which he joined in 1867.  Rupert Kenyon-Slaney said his great-grandfather ""saw sport as a way of keeping everybody active and occupied"". ""He was a huge believer that that sort of helped keep the men busy when they were in barracks, particularly in London,"" he said. Football historian Andy Mitchell said William Kenyon-Slaney played in an England trial match in 1873, and was ""renowned as a speedy dribbler and powerful on the ball"". He was chosen to represent England in the key match against Scotland at London's Oval after the first official international match between the teams ended in a goal-less draw the previous year. One account from the time said he was selected because of an injury to T C Hooman, who played in the same London side, Wanderers.  Mr Mitchell said the match was ""pretty low"" key and only reported in the sporting press, but the two nations had a ""real rivalry"". But an account of the game held by the National Football Museum, said the popularity of football led to a much larger than expected crowd. A heavy rain shower before the match thwarted attempts to take an England team photo however. The account said England made the stronger start and during the first half ""the ball was cleverly directed by Capt Kenyon-Slaney and the Scotch goalkeeper failed to prevent it passing between the posts, as it was just slipper enough from the recent rain to elude his grasp"".  In the second half Kenyon-Slaney scored a second goal, ""by a clever kick from his left foot"" which would become the first winning goal in international football, as England went on to a 4-2 victory. But despite a successful career with two of the biggest clubs of the time, Wanderers and Old Etonians, and five FA Cup wins, Kenyon-Slaney never played for England again. ""Almost certainly military duties came first,"" Mr Mitchell said. ""These guys could have a very busy life."" He also noted there was a big turnover in players for England and Scotland, with the international matches played just once a year and by the 1880s ""the game had been transformed out of recognition"" with the rise of the northern, working class teams. Rupert Kenyon-Slaney said it was notable in a 150-page biography of his great-grandfather, published in 1909, only five lines were devoted to his football career. ""So that sort of says it all, in that it certainly wasn't appreciated during his lifetime, quite what that achievement was going to become,"" he said.  ""He certainly should be celebrated as the scorer of the first international goal, but beyond that think you would be struggling to describe him as a significant contributor to the game."" Rupert Kenyon-Slaney, who still lives in the family home near Shifnal, added they were ""incredibly proud of his achievements"". Local vicar, Reverend Chris Thorpe, said when he was first told of the goal, ""we checked it out with the local football club and nobody knew, neither did local FA."" After doing some research and talking to the family, a service of celebration was held at St Andrew's on Sunday, to mark the goal and an exhibition to document the history of football in the area was put together. A special match will be held in May to raise money for charity. Mr Kenyon-Slaney believes his great-grandfather would have probably liked to have been remembered for his passion for Shropshire and his work for constituents as an MP.  But he added the family was very pleased William Kenyon-Slaney was being recognised for his landmark goal. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the plans departed from the UK's ""international legal obligations"" but was in the ""national interest"" to protect steel makers. She added the decision was made due to ""global disruptions"" to energy markets and supply chains. British steel producers are under pressure from soaring energy prices. Steelmaking is a key industry for some parts of the UK, where it employs 34,000 people and turns over £2bn annually.  Without controls the government has warned the supply of steel into the UK could rise substantially, harming local manufacturers. UK Steel previously said ending the import controls could cause as much as £150m a year in damage. Speaking at the G7 summit in Germany at the weekend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said keeping the import controls on foreign steel would protect metal manufacturers. But there were concerns such a decision could breach international law as the question of extending tariffs on steel imports is seen as potentially breaking World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments. Ms Trevelyan said the decision ""departs from our international legal obligations"" of a WTO agreement. ""However, from time to time, issues may arise where the national interest requires action to be taken,"" she added. The limits on steel imports were first introduced by the European Union in 2018 in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The controls were mirrored by the UK after Brexit. The restrictions, which add a tax to steel imports once a certain quota has been reached, are known as ""steel safeguards"" because they are designed to protect the domestic market from surges of cheap steel from overseas. Mr Johnson said: ""We need British steel to be provided with much cheaper energy."" The controls are currently in place for 15 categories of steel. While controls protecting 10 of those categories have already been extended to 2024, import limits on five categories were set to expire on 30 June, before the government extended them for two years. Steelmaking accounts for just 0.1% of the UK economy - but the material being used in crucial sectors, from defence to transport, means that it's considered an important industry to shelter from cheaper imports. That's why the EU applied tariffs to some types of foreign steel, primarily on steel from China, in 2018, when the UK was a member. Now the UK has chosen to roll over many of those controls.  The move, which has been expected for some months, was reported as one reason for the resignation of the Prime Minister's ethics adviser Lord Geidt - but he later dismissed the issue as a ""distraction"".  The Trade Secretary Anne Marie Trevelyan admits the extension of tariffs could be at odds with World Trade Organization rules - but claims it reflects exceptionally challenging times for the industry, especially in light of high energy costs. She has consulted other countries in the hope of avoiding a challenge, in the process attracting controversy for missing a parliamentary hearing on the Australian trade deal. With the EU and US also retaining similar tariffs, it underlines the tough choices between removing trade barriers, and protecting national businesses. Alasdair McDiarmid, operations director of the steelworkers' union Community, welcomed the extension saying it was ""extremely important"". ""Government made the right call because giving up our safeguards, when the EU and US are maintaining theirs, would leave us exposed to import surges threatening thousands of jobs,"" he said. Ms Trevelyan said maintaining tariffs would help defend a strategic industry and that British steel producers could face ""serious injury"" were the measures not maintained. ""The government is therefore actively engaged with interested parties, including those outside the UK on the future of the UK safeguards and has listened to the concerns raised,"" she added. The largest British trade body representing the industry, UK Steel, said the measures were ""absolutely vital to the long-term health of the steel industry in the UK"". ""Deficient or absent safeguards measures risk trade diversion away from shielded markets elsewhere, resulting in surges of imports into the UK,"" said Richard Warren, head of policy and external affairs at UK Steel. Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour's shadow international trade secretary, said: ""The extension of safeguards will come as a welcome relief to the steel sector. ""It is not anti-competitive to provide a level playing field for our steel industry,"" he said. ""I also support the decision to exclude Ukrainian steel."" But some criticised the move, saying it would stifle the supply of much-needed steel not produced in the UK. Despite being a ""step in the right direction,"" the Confederation of British Metalworkers boss Steve Morley said, the tariffs raise the ""very real prospect of lost orders and production being moved away from the UK."" ""British steel mills have not been able to supply the... materials our members need to support critical domestic and export supply chains, nor are they likely to be able to do so in the near future,"" he said."

It aims to fly to the US and Canada, British and European destinations and, once fully operational, plans to fly to 35 destinations. This initial announcement is the first stage in its plans; the next steps will be securing aircraft and a licence. Initially, the airline says it will employ 50 people at Belfast International Airport and 250 crew. It plans to create 1,000 jobs in the first five years within the airline and indirectly create thousands more in tourism and support sectors.  The new airline says it will create a major hub linking Europe with North American destinations to supplement local passenger numbers.  It will initially operate six aircraft at its Antrim base, growing to a fleet of 18 by 2028. Lower cost long-haul travel is not a new idea but it has proved difficult to sustain in practice. The entrepreneur Freddie Laker started a no-frills service between London and New York in the late 1970s, but it collapsed within five years. Hong Kong-based airline Oasis was another notable failure in 2008, having hoped to serve up to 60 major cities. Norwegian was the most credible of recent attempts but was ultimately undone by the pandemic and has restructured to focus on short haul. Fly Atlantic's chief executive Andrew Pyne said: ""The lack of direct transatlantic air services has clearly been an impediment to Northern Ireland's economic and tourism development, which we now intend to remove. ""We already have offices at the airport and will now be building out the infrastructure to support the airline's launch.""  Managing director of Belfast International Airport Graham Keddie welcomed the announcement by Fly Atlantic. ""We look forward to them bringing this project to fruition as it would have very real economic benefits for Northern Ireland's economy and would further enhance our international connectivity,"" he said. The airline has received support from Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council. Mayor Alderman Stephen Ross said improving connectivity was a ""key part of our economic development strategy and we are delighted that Fly Atlantic has selected Belfast International Airport to become a hub, offering direct flights to North America, UK and Europe"". The Independent's travel correspondent Simon Calder said there were still questions to answer over Fly Atlantic's plans.  Competition from Dublin Airport, which allows US-bound passengers to go through US immigration and customs checks before departure, is one factor to be considered, he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Going up against EasyJet, who run a number of routes from Belfast International, may also cause problems, Mr Calder added. ""Newcomers do not generally do well against well-established, low-cost airlines,"" he said."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52506079","Coronavirus: Will we ever shake hands again?",2020-05-06,NA,NA,"Around the world, humans are struggling to ignore thousands of years of bio-social convention and avoid touching another. Shaking hands might be one of the hardest customs to lose in the post-pandemic world but there are alternatives, writes James Jeffrey. The humble handshake spans the mundane to the potent, ranging from a simple greeting between strangers who will never meet again, to the sealing of billion-dollar deals between business titans.   There are various ideas about the origin of the handshake. It may have originated in ancient Greece as a symbol of peace between two people by showing that neither person was carrying a weapon. Or the shaking gesture of the handshake may have started in Medieval Europe, when knights would shake the hand of others in an attempt to shake loose any hidden weapons.  The Quakers are credited with popularising the handshake after they deemed it to be more egalitarian than bowing. The handshake is a ""literal gesture of human connectedness,"" a symbol of how humans have evolved to be deeply social, tactile-orientated animals, says Cristine Legare, a psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin. With a history tracing back thousands of years, the handshake may be too entrenched to be easily halted.  ""The fact we went for the elbow bump as an alternative shows how important touch is - we didn't want to lose that physical connecting,"" says Prof Legare.  That biological drive to touch and be touched is found in other animals as well. In the 1960s American psychologist Harry Harlow demonstrated how vital touch and affection was for the development of young rhesus monkeys.  Other examples from the animal kingdom include our closest cousins: chimpanzees typically touch palms, hug and sometimes kiss as a form of greeting. Giraffes use their necks that can reach two metres in length to engage in a type of behaviour called ""necking"" - with male giraffes entwining their neck with each other's and swaying and rubbing to assess the other's strength and size to establish dominance. That said, numerous forms of human greeting exist around the world that avoid the transmission trap. Many cultures embrace pressing the palms of hands together with fingers pointing up while accompanied by a slight bow, the traditional Hindu Namaste greeting being one of the most well-known. In Samoa there is the ""eyebrow flash"" that comprises raising your eyebrows while flashing a big smile at the person you are greeting. In Muslim countries, a hand over a heart is a respectful way to greet someone you are not accustomed to touching. And there is the Hawaiian shaka sign, adopted and popularised by American surfers, made by curling the three middle fingers and extending you thumb and smallest finger while shaking your hand back and forth for emphasis. Physical touch has not always been deemed so critical. During the first half of the 20th Century, many psychologists believed that showing affection to children was simply a sentimental gesture that served no real purpose - even cautioning that displays of affection risked spreading diseases and contributing to adult psychological problems.  In her book Don't Look, Don't Touch, behavioural scientist Val Curtis of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says that one possible reason that handshakes and kisses on cheeks endure as greetings is because they signal that the other person is trusted enough to risk sharing germs with - hence the history of the practices going in and out of style depending on public health concerns. In the 1920s, articles appeared in the American Journal of Nursing that warned of hands being the agents of bacterial transfer, and recommending that Americans adapt the Chinese custom at the time, of shaking one's own hands together when greeting a friend. There have been more recent objections to handshakes that pre-date the coronavirus outbreak: in 2015, a UCLA hospital established a handshake-free zone in its intensive care unit (the UCLA policy only lasted six months). Meanwhile, many Muslim women throughout the world have objected to handshakes based on religious grounds.   But despite such reservations and incidences of conscientious objectors to handshakes, as the 20th century progressed the gesture evolved into a near universal and unassailable symbol of professional greeting.  Scientific studies of the ritual have identified how a good handshake activates the same part of the brain that processes other types of reward stimulus such as good food, drink and even sex. As some states in the US begin to ease lockdown measures, the future of the handshake remains uncertain.   ""I don't think we should ever shake hands ever again, to be honest with you,"" Dr Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House coronavirus task force, said back in April. ""Not only would it be good to prevent coronavirus disease; it probably would decrease instances of influenza dramatically in this country."" Social distancing guidelines will likely stay in place for a long time to come, according to US government's guidelines for re-opening the country, especially for vulnerable people like the elderly and those with medical co-morbidities such as lung disease, obesity and diabetes. This could give rise to what Stuart Wolf, associate chair for Clinical Integration and Operations at Dell Medical, calls a ""science-fiction dystopia"" where society would be divided into those who can touch and be touched, and those who must remain isolated. That could create grave psychological consequences, Dr Wolf says. ""We already place such a premium on youth and vigour in society, and this forced artificial distinction between the old and infirm and the young and healthy probably will hit some folks very hard."" The urge to reach out - physically - is deeply wired into us. There's a reason why a US president is estimated to shake hands with 65,000 people per year. ""Habits die hard,"" says Elke Weber, a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University who studies how people take risks. ""On the other hand, habits and social customs can and do change when the social and economic and, in this case, health context changes, [think of] foot binding in China, which was also an ancient custom."" There are already lots of non-contact options. Bowing, for example, is already very widely practiced around the world - and has been credited for fewer deaths due to coronavirus in Thailand. Then there is waving, nodding, smiling and myriad hand signals that don't involve physical contact. But Prof Legare notes that one of Covid-19's cruel ironies is that it is precisely when humans are faced with stressful circumstances that they depend on human touch. ""Think of the ways we respond when people are grieving after death or something bad that's happened, it is with a hug, or it could just be sitting beside a person and touching a shoulder."" Sanitary conventions like fist-bumps and elbow taps just don't quite cut the mustard when it comes to human connectivity. Whenever they occur there is always an internalised complicit knowledge of how they go against the grain of intuitive friendliness, notes Steven Pinker, Harvard University's Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology, in an article for The Harvard Gazette, the university's official news website.  ""That explains why, at least in my experience, people accompany these gestures with a little laugh, as if to reassure each other that the superficially aggressive displays are new conventions in a contagious time and offered in a spirit of camaraderie,"" Prof Pinker says.    Due to her work in public health, including infectious diseases, Deliana Garcia was already moving away from handshakes with most people. But some habits are harder to break than others. ""I am a fanatical hugger,"" says Ms Garcia, noting social distancing with her 85-year-old mother has been particularly hard. ""She is so close, and I just want to walk up to her and smooch her little face and give her a kiss and tell her I love her."" This powerful urge collides with concerns about transmission, resulting in an ""awkward dance"" between the two of them, she says.   ""Even as she is approaching, I can feel myself growing anxious - what if I make her sick?"" Ms Garcia says. ""So I withdraw, but if she starts to move away, I follow. I need the tactile to assure myself and yet I can't let her get close. We sort of repel one another like identical poles on magnets."" As hard as a future without handshakes or touch may be, it is better than the alternative, Prof Weber says. ""I don't think people are overreacting at this point, quite the opposite."" ""Survival or trying to stay alive is another important basic human drive. The alternative is to go back to life as we knew it and ignore the fact that large numbers of elderly, overweight and people with co-morbidities will die until we establish herd immunity, which will take considerable time.""  But don't give up on the humble handshake just yet. While avoiding disease is an essential part of human survival, so is living fulfilling and complex social lives, says Arthur Markman, a professor in the department of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. ""Perhaps we start by focusing on more routine handwashing, hand sanitisers, and strategies to avoid touching your face rather than giving up touch altogether,"" he says. ""The real concern is that we will develop a new normal that is devoid of touch, and so we will not realise what we are missing by not having any tactile contact with the people in our social network.""

When asked whether this could lead to a possible breach of international law, Boris Johnson responded ""these are tough choices we have to make"".  It follows a proposed approach set out by the international trade secretary on Thursday. But the Department for International Trade said a final decision has not yet been made.  Speaking at the G7 summit in Germany, Mr Johnson said keeping the import controls on foreign steel would protect British producers which are already under pressure from rising energy prices. ""We need British steel to be provided with much cheaper energy,"" Mr Johnson said.  ""But until we can fix that, I think it is reasonable for UK steel to have the same protections that absolutely every other European steel economy does."" Earlier this month, Mr Johnson linked the resignation of his ethics adviser Lord Geidt to a disagreement about future decisions on steel tariffs.  But Mr Geidt said that interpretation of his decision to quit didn't reflect ""the far wider scope of my objection"".  The limits on steel imports being considered were first introduced by the European Union in 2018 in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The controls were mirrored by the UK after Brexit.  The restrictions, which add a tariff to steel imports once a certain quota has been reached, are known as ""steel safeguards"" because they are designed to protect the domestic market from surges of cheap steel from overseas.  The controls are currently in place for 15 categories of steel. While controls protecting 10 of those categories have already been extended to 2024, import limits on five categories are set to expire on 30 June. The question of extending tariffs on steel imports is seen as potentially breaking World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments. Asked whether the government was considering imposing tariffs which may be illegal, cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said the government was focused on ""ensuring we work within international law."" Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, the Northern Ireland Secretary said he was ""not saying the government is going to do this"" but that ""this is something that is supported across the sector"" and the government has ""got to look at all these things"" and ""get the balance right.""  UK Steel, the lobby group for the British steel industry, said it was confident extending the steel controls would be ""WTO compliant"" and ""there would be no legitimate reason for challenges"".   The Department for International Trade said it is consulting with foreign counterparts in adherence with World Trade Organization rules, before making a final decision on whether to extend the safeguards. UK Steel said ending the import controls would expose British steelmakers to a distorted global marketplace and that could cause as much as £150m a year in damage.  Also speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said Labour would support the prime minister in the tariffs being continued. ""It's an extension that both the EU and the Americans have continued with so we would support him,"" he said.  ""Steel workers support him, the unions support him, industry supports him and Labour does support him."" But the Conservative MP and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat tweeted today: ""Protectionism is destructive to all of us.

Flying between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur takes about an hour, and there are plans to build a high-speed rail link between the two. The figures mean an average of 84 flights per day plied the route. The route is operated by a host of budget carriers such as Scoot, Jetstar, Air Asia and Malindo Air as well as the two countries' flagship carriers, Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines.

The decision follows the cancellation of the official draw for the tournament, which was due to be held in Bali last Friday. The Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) said Fifa was forced to cancel the draw after Bali's governor Wayan Koster refused to host the Israeli team. The U20 World Cup is set to take place from 20 May to 11 June.  Indonesia does not have any formal diplomatic ties with Israel and recently protesters have held marches demanding Israel be stopped from competing in the tournament, in support of Palestine. Indonesia were awarded hosting rights in 2019, before Israel qualified for the tournament. England's U20 team is also set to compete.  ""Fifa has decided, due to the current circumstances, to remove Indonesia as the host of the Fifa U20 World Cup 2023,"" a Fifa statement said.

Half an hour before Fifa's announcement, PSSI executive committee member Arya Sinulingga said he was ""very pessimistic"" about Indonesia keeping the hosting rights. ""If we make political requirements in sports, it'll always be like this. We will be exiled from the football ecosystem.  ""It's very tough for all of us. We're headed into a calamity in sports.

Criticism of Israel in the country and its policy towards Palestine has been growing after Bali's governor said he did not want them to play in his region and Friday's planned group stage draw was cancelled. Fifa knew any decision to strip Indonesia of hosting rights would be hugely controversial but it was also aware it had to do everything to protect Israel's players against potential security threats. With the 24-team tournament due to begin on 20 May - with Indonesia now no longer competing - Fifa needs to come up with an alternative pretty quickly."

Agriculture, Countryside and Land Management Services set up the camera to capture photos at Lihoumel, a small island to the west of Lihou. The time-lapse images observed a colony of shags on the island to ""provide an indication of the health"" of the world's wider marine ecosystem. Guernsey and Herm support more than 1% of the population of European shags. Lihou is a designated Ramsar Site, which marks it as a place of international importance. The Seabirdwatch initiative is led by Oxford University, University College Cork and Oxford Brookes University with research partners from across the North Atlantic, including the UK, Ireland, Svalbard, Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. It aims to use the photos to monitor seabird populations. Emily Coule, natural environment officer for the States of Guernsey, said the photos would ""help researchers in several areas"", and allow the public to ""view otherwise unseen parts of our environment"". She said: ""It's fantastic to see the images being published as part of this international programme.

That is according to a submission from the Department for the Economy (DfE) to the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC). However, a report by the MAC has said that international students should not be removed from immigration targets. The government commissioned the committee to report on the impact of international students in the UK. The DfE submission said that Northern Ireland's political past had a negative impact on students coming to Northern Ireland to study as it ""led to a lower share of the international student market than would otherwise have been the case"". Around 5% of around 55,000 students in Northern Ireland are from non-EU or EU countries outside the UK or Republic of Ireland. However, only 1% of all international students studying in the UK are enrolled in universities in NI. The DfE submission said that as the average salary of newly-qualified graduates in Northern Ireland was lower on average than in the rest of the UK, it could be difficult for international students to transfer from a student visa to a work visa at the end of their studies. This, DfE said had ""a knock-on effect on the ability of Northern Ireland institutions to attract their share of international students in the first place"". ""This is exacerbated further by the attractive visa arrangements in the Republic of Ireland which enable students to remain for up to 24 months post study for the purposes of seeking employment,"" it said. However, the MAC rejected a proposal for a separate post-study work visa for students similar to that operating in the Republic of Ireland. Universities UK had suggested that international students should be able to remain and work in the UK for two years after graduation. ""Whilst the higher and further education sectors in Northern Ireland recognise the need for controls in immigration, they are of the view that international students should not be part of any immigration target,"" the DfE submission concluded. ""They are very clear that international students and international partnerships have a critical part to play in the sustainability and development of our institutions."" The submission also said that both universities were seeking to expand their international student numbers. A previous report published earlier this year said that international students were worth around £170m to the Northern Irish economy."

According to the Indigenous Foundation, dreamcatchers symbolise unity and provide protection. Ms Mann will be with three colleagues on the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft as part of the Crew-5 mission. She could also go to the Moon. In 2020 she was selected to be in a pool of astronauts eligible for Nasa's Artemis programme that will send humans to the Moon. Ms Mann, originally from California, studied mechanical engineering at Stanford university. She become a colonel in the Marine Corps, flying various fighter aircraft. She has been deployed twice on aircraft carriers supporting combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and was awarded six medals for her service to the US military. This expedition will be Mann's first spaceflight since she became an astronaut in 2013, Nasa confirms. She is one of eight members of the 21st Nasa astronaut class, formed for space station operations and potential future assignments to the Moon and Mars. She will be joined by astronaut and pilot Josh Cassada, astronaut Koichi Wakata from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and Russian cosmonaut Anna Kikina.

Graham Bonham-Carter was arrested on Tuesday accused of funding properties purchased by Oleg Deripaska - one of Russia's most controversial oligarchs who was sanctioned by the US in 2018.  Mr Bonham-Carter is also accused of unlawfully moving his artwork abroad, the US Department of Justice said.  The US is now seeking Mr Bonham-Carter's extradition, the DoJ said. Mr Bonham-Carter, who is based in London and is the second cousin of actress Helena, appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court following the extradition request and was released on conditional bail. As well as being sanctioned by the US in 2018, Mr Deripaska was one of seven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK in March as part of the government's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Mr Bonham-Carter is believed to be linked to the oligarch through a number of high-value properties in the US and in the UK - all suspected to be ultimately held for Mr Deripaksa's benefit. In March, Mr Bonham-Carter had his bank accounts frozen for six months under orders which were secured by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) after it was alleged his accounts contained money linked to Mr Deripaska.  Mr Bonham-Carter faces three US charges - conspiring to violate and evade US sanctions in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), one count of violating IEEPA and one count of wire fraud. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Mr Bonham-Carter is accused of engaging in more than $1m (£900,000) worth of illicit transactions to fund real estate properties in the US for Mr Deripaska's benefit. It is alleged that the businessman was instructed by Mr Deripaska to set up a company, named GBCM Ltd, for managing his properties, including two in New York and one in Washington DC.  Mr Deripaska wealth has been estimated to be more than £2bn.  "
"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-58394733","Edinburgh festivals: No fireworks but many are just happy it happened",2021-08-31,"Pauline McLean","BBC Scotland arts correspondent","In previous years, the nightly fireworks exploding over the Royal Mile have begun to lose their appeal by the end of a long month of Edinburgh's festivals but this August, like so much else, they were missing. The Edinburgh Military Tattoo itself, which for years has ended each performance in a volley of explosions, was absent from the city. And the international visitors it attracts were nowhere to be seen either. Even the street performers had restricted hours and spaces as Covid restrictions left their mark. The Fringe, the International Festival, the book, art and film festivals all went ahead but the Covid limits meant a smaller, more intimate festival experience this year. Its success will be judged on moments, rather than box office sales.  Most of the festivals had access to public funding, to stage their work in new ways. The Edinburgh International Festival hired pavilions for their programme of 170 events while four Fringe regulars - the Gilded Balloon, Zoo, Dance Base and the Traverse Theatre - transformed a multi-storey car park into a venue which featured an open-air performance stage, food stalls and bars. People performed in parks, beaches, back gardens and bandstands but it's not profitable, or sustainable. With the reduction in social distancing only confirmed a week before the events began, most organisations stuck with two-metre distancing, or sold tickets in family group bubbles.  With tickets limited, and a fraction of the shows on offer, many sold out, giving audiences a rare opportunity to see artists like Damon Albarn or Renee Fleming up close and personal.  Just before his two concerts in Edinburgh, Albarn had performed with his band Gorillaz for 50,000 people at the 02 in London. In Edinburgh, there were just 700 of us. All five summer festival directors had to plan for the best, but prepare for the worst, and be ready for suddenly cancellations due to Covid. Book Festival director Nick Barley arrived at Bute House on Sunday, expecting a reception hosted by the first minister, only to be turned around at the front door after Nicola Sturgeon was forced to self-isolate. Plans were already in place for the live event she was due to host with Shuggie Bain author Douglas Stuart on the closing night of the festival, although in the end, both were able to be there in person. The capacity to be online was vital for all the festivals, and the hybrid approach, with big screens outside, proved to be extremely successful, especially at the book and film festivals. The Edinburgh International Film Festival was back in the mix this August, having previously relocated to June, and although most of its big name stars were on screen, rather than in person, it added a much-needed buzz to the city.  The pandemic has meant not just a lost year, but a lost title, that of longest continuously running film festival, but it's also revived interest among film fans, not just in Edinburgh but across Scotland, which should stand it in good stead. Next year marks the 75th anniversary of the Edinburgh International, Fringe and Film festivals.  Many of the things they planned, are already in progress. New ways of working. More collaboration. Sharing resources.  In previous years, the measure of success was at the box office.  An ever-increasing number of tickets sold, or shows staged.  This year, it's been a much quieter success story, and for many, the measure of success is that Edinburgh's festivals happened at all."

The letter is signed by 13 medics from hospitals across Northern Ireland. It calls for the public to stick to government guidance on reducing social interactions.  It also warns against ""stigmatising people and areas with high levels of infection"". The letter reads: ""We need to support people who test positive. ""This pandemic requires us to work together to bring it under control urgently. ""We need to reduce the potential for transmission to protect our health service, and we need to fix our test and trace system to try and gain better control of this virus in our community.  ""If the current trajectory continues and we don't gain control of this urgently, it will become harder to bring under control."" On Monday, 616 new cases of Covid-19 were identified in Northern Ireland, bringing the total during the pandemic to 14,690. The number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health remains at 584. Among those who have signed the letter are Dr Claire Donnelly, a consultant physician who specialises in infectious diseases; consultant virologist Dr Conall McCaughey and consultant paediatrician Dr Sharon Christie. Entitled an ""appeal to people to adhere to Covid public health guidance"", the letter lays bare the stark reality of the infections rates. The letter adds: ""Worryingly the number of cases is increasing rapidly in many areas over the last week, indicating that we have widespread community transmission in many parts of Northern Ireland. ""We are in an exponential or rapid growth phase when cases can quickly rise and overload our health care system.  ""The proportion of tests that are positive compared to the overall number of tests is an important indicator of the level of community transmission. ""There remains clear evidence that Covid is a serious disease with the ability to cause severe illness and suffering for people and their families.  The medic say that data shows the ""increase is real and not due to expanded testing"". They add: ""We appeal to everybody in Northern Ireland to do their utmost to reduce social interactions immediately, to follow social distancing of two metres or more, to wear face coverings as recommended, to practise hand hygiene, to get tested and self-isolate, to limit spread when they have symptoms and to use the NI Covid App."" In response, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care, said: ""NHS Test and Trace is providing tests at an unprecedented scale - with around 250,000 a day on average over the last week.  ""We are targeting testing capacity at the areas that need it most, including those where there is an outbreak, and prioritising at-risk groups. ""Since NHS Test and Trace launched, over 580,000 people have been told to self-isolate, helping to reduce transmission of the virus and save lives."" "
"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51462613","Omar al-Bashir: Sudan agrees ex-president must face ICC",2020-02-11,NA,NA,"Sudan's rulers have agreed to hand over ex-President Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to face genocide and war crimes charges. Bashir is accused of serious crimes in a conflict that broke out in Darfur in 2003 and led to the deaths of 300,000. Authorities said the former president, and others charged by the ICC, should appear before the court. The commitment came at peace talks between Sudan's government and rebel groups from the Darfur region. ""Justice cannot be achieved if we don't heal the wounds,"" said Mohammed Hassan al-Taishi, a spokesman for the Sudanese government. He told BBC Focus on Africa radio that Bashir and three others would be handed over to the ICC.  Asked if supporters of the ousted president would accept this decision, Mr Taishi replied that no-one was above justice. ""We are doing what the Sudanese people asked us to do,"" he added. Mr Taishi stressed that he was expressing the view of the government, which includes powerful generals in the military, and not his personal view.   Mr Taishi is a civilian member of Sudan's sovereign council, the body overseeing the country's transition to democracy. By Mohanad Hashim, BBC Sudan analyst The Sudanese delegation negotiating with rebels in Darfur has made a key concession to victims of the Darfur conflict by agreeing that all those wanted by the ICC should be handed over to the court to stand trial. The surrender of former President Bashir is, in fact, something that Sudan's top military general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan alluded to at a meeting in December with victims of the conflict. But there is no guarantee that it will happen - the generals may renege on the deal. If it does happen, it is unlikely to be anytime soon, as talks to end the conflict still have a long way to go and the transfer of the wanted men - from both sides of the conflict - would have to be part of a broader peace deal. Bashir, who refused to recognise the authority of the court when he was charged for crimes in the region in 2009, was ousted as president in April last year. On Tuesday, one of his lawyers told Reuters news agency that Bashir would continue to refuse to deal with the ICC, describing it as a ""political court"". ICC prosecutors in The Hague requested that the former leader stand trial over the Darfur killings and issued an arrest warrant for him on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The UN says that in addition to those killed in fighting between local armed groups, and Bashir's forces and government-backed militia - such as the infamous Janjaweed - around 2.5 million people were displaced in the war. Warrants for Bashir's arrest were issued in 2009 and 2010 by the ICC. The court investigates and brings to justice people suspected of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute. The ICC was established by a UN treaty in 2002, and has been ratified by 123 countries, including the UK. However, several countries - including China, India, Russia and the US - have refused to join, while some African countries say the court is unfairly focused on Africans. The international court has been criticised in the past for securing too few convictions, mishandling cases and over-reaching its jurisdiction.  Bashir, 76, came to power in a military coup in 1989 and ruled Sudan with an iron fist. In December, he was sentenced to two years in a social reform facility for corruption. Under Sudanese law, people over the age of 70 cannot serve jail terms. Prosecutors in Sudan have also charged him with the killing of protesters during the demonstrations that led to him being ousted. Bashir denies all allegations against him."

The biggest contest in the trialling calendar draws spectators from as far away as Australia, Canada and Brazil.  Hundreds of dogs and their owners competed in trials to secure a spot in the three-day event. Winning the International Supreme Champion title is worth more than just a cash prize and a trophy - the winning dog can boost its trainer's reputation.  International Sheepdog Society National President John McCullough said he was delighted the event was being held in Northern Ireland for the first time since 2002.  Three local farmers battled 150 others at the Irish National Sheepdog Trials last month in County Mayo to make it on to the Ireland team competing at the Gill Hall Estate.  For Frankie McCullough, who runs a sheep farm outside Ballynahinch, his dogs are workers first and foremost. Their day-to-day training consists of herding his flock up and down the rocky hillside twice a day.  ""There's a lot of work that goes into training them from pups, sometimes you think you have a good one until it comes to lambing and you know you haven't,"" he told BBC news NI. ""You could spend two years getting a dog really well trained, and then you find out he's not the ticket.  ""But it's nice when you get one that you really like, you'll both get more out of it."" As if vying for the top title wasn't stressful enough, Frankie McCullough is also providing all the sheep for the event, but says his dog's familiarity with the herd won't give them an added advantage.  ""I think it's an advantage for everybody that the sheep will be so used to working with dogs,"" he said. ""Some trials you go to and they've mostly herded with motorbikes, so nobody has an advantage. ""Whereas this herd is used to dogs, so it's a level playing field for everybody, and the sheep will respect the dogs."" For Frankie McCullough, trialling is a hobby, and he competes fewer than 10 times a year, compared to serious triallists who would take part in 40 or 50 competitions.  He has several sheepdogs and, while none are kept as pets, there's a clear family favourite - with one brown eye, and the other a piercing blue, Spot stands out from the bunch.  ""He's the hot favourite in the house, everybody likes him,"" said Mr McCullough. ""When he was reared as a pup he was trained to play with a ball, so he likes kids and plays ball with the grandchildren. ""You get some silly young dogs, but Spot's not like that. He's not only obedient, he's clever."""
"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60739598","Roman Abramovich: Sanctions restrict rent payments to Crown Estate",2022-03-15,"Joshua Nevett","BBC Politics","The UK sanctions against Roman Abramovich have restricted rent payments to the Crown Estate, which manages properties owned by the Queen. The UK government froze Mr Abramovich's assets last week as part of its sanctions response to the Ukraine war. He and other wealthy Russians have been targeted to put pressure on President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions prevent them from making transactions related to their properties and businesses in the UK. Mr Abramovich's frozen assets include Chelsea FC, which was allowed to continue operating under a special licence granted by the UK government. The 55-year-old Russian billionaire, who has denied close ties to President Putin, has also been linked to the ownership of properties in the UK. They include a 15-bedroom mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens, an exclusive street known as ""billionaires' row"" in west London. Land records show companies that manage assets for Mr Abramovich are registered as the lease owners of the property. This means the companies own the home, but the land it was built on belongs to the Crown Estate - a business created by Parliament to oversee a portfolio of the British monarch's properties. The Queen is not involved in management decisions by the Crown Estate, which is tasked with generating profit for the government. The terms of the lease require the companies to pay the Crown Estate ""£10,000 rising to £160,000"" over a 125-year term, a Land Registry document shows. When asked about the impact of sanctions on Mr Abramovich, a spokesperson for the Crown Estate said they would not comment on the details of individual leases. But condemning the invasion of Ukraine, the spokesperson said: ""We are doing all we can to comply swiftly with the introduction of sanctions."" The BBC has requested comment from a spokesperson for Mr Abramovich. The restrictions on rent payments were first reported by the Wall Street Journal newspaper, which said Mr Abramovich bought the house for $140m (£107m) in 2011.  Built in the mid-1800s, the Grade II listed building hosted a Soviet diplomatic mission in 1972 and is across the road from Kensington Palace. Last week the UK government imposed travel bans and full asset freezes on ""seven of Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs"", including Mr Abramovich. These measures prohibit anyone in the UK from dealing with frozen assets owned, held or controlled by a sanctioned person. Legal experts said Mr Abramovich would have to apply for licences to make any transactions related to his properties - from security services and utility bills, to maintenance and gardeners. A licence is a written permission from the Treasury allowing an act that would otherwise breach financial sanctions. The special licence granted to Chelsea FC is one example. A Treasury spokesperson said the department cannot comment on specific properties. In general, though, a sanctioned person who is subject to an asset freeze can still live in their house but cannot rent or sell it, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said they can ""apply for a licence on the grounds of 'basic needs', which can cover things like payment of insurance, property management, rent or mortgage payments, utility charges"". ""The licence would enable their bank to release those specific payments without contravening the freeze."" Joshua Ray, a lawyer for Rahman Ravelli, told the BBC that licence applications ""can often take at least several weeks if not longer"". ""With respect to licences related to Chelsea, the government has signalled a willingness to put applications on a fast track, but that doesn't appear to apply to his other UK assets,"" said Mr Ray, who advises international companies on sanctions. Treasury guidance says lawyers advising a sanctioned person ""cannot receive any payment"" for that service without a licence. Mr Ray said Mr Abramovich ""would likely need to engage a lawyer located in a jurisdiction where he is not yet sanctioned"". On Sunday, Housing Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme the government was looking at using the properties of Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the UK for ""humanitarian purposes"". But he said there was ""quite a high legal bar to cross and we're not talking about permanent confiscation, adding ""if we can use it in order to help others let's do that""."

Klim Shipenko and actor Yulia Peresild left the International Space Station and landed in Kazakhstan - to be met by a crew filming touchdown scenes. The ISS shooting was not without drama - suitable for a film called Challenge. On Friday the ISS unexpectedly tilted after a glitch in its thrusters, pausing filming. It was not thought to be part of the script. In a farewell tweet from the ISS, Peresild showed off a weightless hairdo likely to thwart any conspiracy theorists who think it was all shot on Earth: The movie has been in its own kind of space race - with Tom Cruise. He is apparently part of a Hollywood filming-in-space project involving Nasa and Elon Musk's SpaceX. The module carrying Peresild and Shipenko, along with cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy, parachuted down to Earth at about lunchtime on Sunday in the Kazakhstan steppe. Their departure was not delayed by Friday's glitch, which resulted in lost positioning control for about half an hour. It wasn't the film crew's only close encounter with tech breakdown. On arrival on 5 October, the Soyuz's automatic Kurs docking system failed and the commander had to switch to manual control. The actor and director will now be taken to Russia's Star City training base for a 10-day rehab, which is two days less than their actual space stay. The plot of Challenge has not been detailed, but the section in the ISS appears to be that of a doctor - Peresild's character - operating on a sick cosmonaut (Novitskiy, in a cameo role) whose medical condition means he cannot be treated on Earth. The feature film is the brainchild of the head of space agency Roscosmos, who at one point fired the head of crewed missions in a row over the project.  Sergei Krikalev, a veteran of space missions, got his job back days later amid widespread anger at his sacking."

Accounts linked to Graham Bonham-Carter, second cousin of actress Helena, and part of the extended famous family, were put on hold on Friday. National Crime Agency investigators believe the accounts were being used to help Oleg Deripaska avoid sanctions.  It is alleged Mr Bonham-Carter manages property on behalf of the oligarch.  Granting the order, Westminster Magistrates Court has given the National Crime Agency six months to investigate the accounts, in one of the first public court moves against an oligarch since the Ukraine crisis began. Mr Bonham-Carter's lawyers have been contacted for comment. There is no suggestion anyone else in the Bonham-Carter family is being investigated by the NCA.  Oleg Deripaska is one of the richest men associated with President Putin - having made billions from his stake in Russia's aluminium industries.  He's been subjected to US sanctions since 2018 - but is not under any sanctions in the UK.  He first became widely known in the UK in 2008, when it emerged he had been involved in talks over a donation to the Conservative Party via George Osborne. The donation was never made - but the story triggered a huge row at the time about links between British politicians and Russia's elites. Mr Bonham-Carter is described, on his Linkedin profile, as the director of a company that runs private homes and estates.  Andrew Chadwick, a National Crime Agency investigator, told Westminster Magistrates Court that it wanted to freeze five bank accounts associated with Mr Bonham-Carter, of Surrey, to allow Mr Chadwick to investigate suspected links to Oleg Deripaska.  ""The application is in respect of account-freezing orders for several bank accounts, held by Graham Bonham-Carter, of Surrey,"" said Mr Chadwick. ""My investigation is that he is heavily linked with a well-known Russian oligarch, who is linked to various crimes and criminality and is currently subject to sanctions in the United States. ""My submission is that funds in accounts held by Mr Bonham-Carter may be for the use of, or from, criminal activity."" ""Oleg Deripaska is a Russian national subject to sanctions since 2019,"" said Mr Chadwick.  The officer told the court the US Treasury alleges Mr Deripaska has been involved in money laundering, threatening rivals, wiretapping a government official, extortion, racketeering, ordering a murder and having links to Russian organised crime. Mr Deripaska has called the US allegations and sanctions absurd.  The court heard that Mr Bonham-Carter had no criminal record and was not under investigation for taking part in organised crime.  He was said to be linked to Mr Deripaska through five properties - two in the United States and three in the UK, all of which are suspected to be ultimately held for the oligarch's benefit.  In London, Mr Chadwick said two properties, worth a combined £50m, were owned by a company based in the British Virgin Islands. That company benefited Mr Deripaska and the 'care-of' mailing address had been to Mr Bonham-Carter.  The third UK property is Hamstone House, a mansion near Weybridge, Surrey, currently on the market for £18m. Mr Chadwick said that it was owned by Edenfield Investments and, according to public research, Mr Bonham-Carter's name had appeared on Land Registry documentation for the property when it was purchased. One of the aforementioned London properties had also been the forwarding address for mail to Hamstone House. The two US properties, in New York and Washington, are owned by a company headed by Mr Bonham-Carter. ""Based on that information [about Mr Deripaska's apparent property] I have reasonable grounds to suspect that the accounts are being held for unlawful conduct,"" said Mr Chadwick.  ""Mr Bonham-Carter has well-documented strong links to Mr Deripaska.  ""The suspicion is that property held in the name of Mr Bonham-Carter, or companies that he is linked to, in fact belongs to Mr Deripaska - and the reason for the structure is to mask the true ultimate beneficial owner and to evade the sanctions.""  District Judge Tan Ikran approved the National Crime Agency's freezing order for the next six months - allowing the agency time to investigate. The accounts hold just over £100,000, but the NCA has established that nearly £800,000 has additionally flowed through them since November 2020.  Mr Bonham-Carter will have the chance to make representations to the court at a date to be fixed. "
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66751351",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Agents' fees for international transfers in 2023 are nearing $1bn (£800m), according to football's world governing body Fifa. In its 'International Transfer Snapshot', collated after the transfer window in all the major European leagues closed, Fifa said the overall spending on deals where players switched countries between 1 June and 1 September was $7.36bn (£5.9bn) in the men's game, up 47.2% on last year. It was $3m (£2.4m) in the women's game - an increase of 140.8%. While some of the detail, especially around the growth in spending of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), could have been predicted given the Saudi Pro-League's increased recruitment drive, the amounts now being paid to agents is growing hugely. Fifa says the total amount paid to agents during the recent transfer window was $696.6m (£558.3m), which ""corresponds to nearly 10% of the total spending on transfer fees"". This compares to 5.8% in 2013. Saudi Pro League: European football is not in danger from Saudi spending, says European Club Association Fifa adds that despite over three months of 2023 still remaining, the ""total amount of service fees for club agents since the beginning of the year has already reached $865m (£693.25m). This is the highest total ever recorded and 38.8% higher than the whole of 2022"". Given the figures do not include transfers that take place within a single country, Fifa concedes the overall amounts paid to agents is likely to be ""substantially higher"". Fifa's new regulations around agents which, in part, aim to curb ""excessive fees"" come into force on 1 October. In the report, Fifa confirms a total of 10,125 international transfers took place in the men's game during the summer window, a rise of 2.2%, with spending increasing by more than 45%. Over 75% of the international transfers involved at least one European club. However, the Saudi Pro-League's presence is being felt. Clubs in the AFC, of which Saudi Arabia is a part, spent $1.03bn (£830m), which represented 14% of the total international transfer spend. Fifa confirmed it is ""the first time ever that spending on transfer fees by clubs from any confederation other than Uefa surpassed 10% of the global total"". Aside from the $1.98bn (£1.6bn) spent by English clubs, Saudi Arabia had the largest spend of any country. The $875.4m (£701.6m) its clubs spent - a figure that has risen already due to deals done since 1 September, including Demarai Gray's move from Everton to Al-Ettifaq - was a 3,100% rise on a year earlier, underlining the change in strategy around football recruitment. The growth in the women's game is also translating into increased transfer activity. A total of 829 moves were conducted internationally between June and the beginning of September, a 19.1% increase. The vast majority - 84.4% - involved out-of-contract players, but a record $3m (£2.4m) was paid in transfer fees, a 140.8% increase on last year. FIFA confirmed 'at least one agent' acted on behalf of a club in 73 of those 829 transfers. The total amount paid to agents involved in women's deals was $900,000 (£721,300), more than 30% of the overall spend.

Teesside International Airport will host the event in June, and organisers have said they are ""over the moon"" to be able to bring it back. Full details of the displays have yet to be announced, but there will be fly-bys and aeroplanes, a classic car show, displays from the Army, and live music. About 18,000 visitors attended the last one in 2017, and it is hoped this will attract up to 25,000. It is being organised by the team behind the Skylive Airshows which took place in 2016 and 2017, Chris Petty and Steve Davies. Mr Petty said: ""I'm over the moon that we're bringing the Teesside Airshow back for another year now that large-scale events can go ahead once again.  ""We're expecting this to be a sell-out event, with people coming from far and wide to see our displays and aircraft - especially after the Sunderland Airshow was recently cancelled.""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47400060","New Ernie, same slim odds of winning",2019-03-01,"Kevin Peachey","Personal finance reporter","It has responsibility for drawing the winning numbers for three million prizes every month, worth £90m, and now it is getting a new lease of life. Ernie - or Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment - is the machine which lives in Blackpool making the regular Premium Bonds draw. Its fifth incarnation - a computer chip the size of a grain of rice - has now drawn its first winners. Selecting the numbers only takes minutes, compared to the nine hours taken by its immediate predecessor and the 10 days it took Ernie 1 to complete the draw. But, whatever the speed of the selection, there is no improvement in the 24,500-1 odds of each bond winning a tax-free prize of up to £1m. In its long history the technology behind Ernie has changed dramatically. Ernie 1 was developed in the Post Office Research Department in Dollis Hill, north London, where the code-breaking World War Two computer Colossus was constructed. It was a massive contraption - a hybrid vacuum tube and transistor machine - and it started work in 1957. The original was retired in 1973 and replaced by a machine designed to look like one of the sets from the James Bond film Goldfinger. Next, in 1988, came the more bijou and faster Ernie 3. This was replaced by Ernie 4 in 2004, which has drawn more than three million winners in its time. Now, Ernie 5 has started to select the winning numbers The newest, fastest machine is now choosing the winning numbers, with the technology housed in a tiny computer chip. The first £1m jackpot winners are a man from Somerset and a woman from Buckinghamshire. All the previous machines have used thermal noise to produce random numbers. The latest version is powered by quantum technology - the ability to produce random numbers through light.  The savings product was launched by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in April 1956, with the first bonds going on sale in November of that year, and the first draw the following year. As well as providing an alternative way to save, the hope was that it would also help reduce inflation. It has become one of the most popular savings products in the UK, with 21 million people holding these bonds sold by government-backed National Savings and Investments. There is ongoing debate about whether Premium Bonds represent a sensible investment choice. Savers obviously sacrifice potential interest on these savings for the possibility of winning a prize, however unlikely that might be. Claire Walsh, financial expert at investment firm Schroders, said the randomised nature of winnings mean that savers would need to hold a large amount to achieve the average winnings return of 1.4%. ""People with small sums may go years without any winnings, effectively getting no return at all. By contrast there are numerous cash savings accounts where you could achieve an equivalent (or higher) guaranteed return on your savings,"" she said. She added that many people hold Premium Bonds for years, but the danger in doing so is that the value would not keep pace with inflation. All pictures courtesy of NS&I and subject to copyright"
"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55247033","Court finds UK war crimes but will not take action",2020-12-09,NA,NA,"The International Criminal Court says it will not take action against the UK, despite finding evidence British troops committed war crimes in Iraq. A 180-page report says hundreds of Iraqi detainees were abused by British soldiers between 2003 and 2009. But the ICC could not determine whether the UK had acted to shield soldiers from prosecution. The MoD said the ICC report ""vindicates our efforts to pursue justice where allegations have been founded"". The ICC told the BBC: ""It is without dispute there is evidence war crimes were committed."" Its report said there was a reasonable basis to conclude that at least seven Iraqis were illegally killed while in British custody between April and September 2003. The ICC report refers to evidence of a pattern of war crimes carried out across a number of years by soldiers from several British regiments. Some detainees were raped or subjected to sexual violence. Others were beaten so badly they died from their injuries.  The Iraqi individuals, many of them civilians, were unarmed and in British custody at the time. The UK government has repeatedly accused human rights lawyers of bringing vexatious claims, but the ICC says it is ""disingenuous to describe the entire body of claims, involving hundreds of claimants, as baseless or spurious"". A BBC Panorama investigation last year revealed that British detectives had also found credible evidence of war crimes committed in Iraq. But the programme discovered that despite this, not one of the cases was taken forward by the army's prosecution service.  The ICC said it took Panorama's findings very seriously, and that on the whole the information it received was consistent with the reports in the programme.  It could ""not rule out"" that there had been a cover up on the part of the British authorities. Its report concluded that investigations by the Royal Military Police had been ""inadequate"" and were ""marred by a lack of independence and impartiality"".  However, it could not make a determination as to whether the UK had acted to shield soldiers from prosecution.  The ICC said it will reopen its examination of the UK's conduct in Iraq ""should new facts or evidence"" come to light.  The UK government is currently seeking to introduce a controversial new law which will make it harder to prosecute British soldiers.  It says the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Bill, if passed, ""delivers on the government's manifesto commitment to tackle vexatious claims and end the cycle of re-investigations against our brave Armed Forces"".  After scrutinising the proposed legislation, Parliament's Joint Human Rights Committee has said: ""We found that the real problem is that investigations into incidents have been inadequate, insufficiently resourced, insufficiently independent and not done in a timely manner. ""The government is effectively using the existence of inadequate investigations as a reason to legislate to bring in further barriers to bringing prosecutions or to providing justice for victims"". There is a palpable sense of relief inside the Ministry of Defence that the International Criminal Court will not be pursuing a case against the UK government over allegations that British forces in Iraq committed serious war crimes against Iraqi detainees. That said, there's still the potential that the ICC report will cause the government problems. The publication comes as the government tries to pass new legislation aimed at protecting troops from what it calls ""vexatious claims"" by lawyers against British troops over allegations of abuse. Among the proposals of the Overseas Operations Bill is a presumption against prosecution five years after any alleged abuse, unless there's compelling new evidence. The legislation, which has already passed its first stages in the Commons, has been widely criticised by opposition parties, human rights groups, lawyers and some former senior military commanders. The ICC report also raises concerns about the legislation. The Ministry of Defence says the ICC has brought no new evidence to light. But the ICC prosecutor says: ""The fact the allegations investigated by the UK did not result in prosecutions does not mean that these claims were vexatious."" Those words will  be seized upon by the bill's critics.   One of the investigations by the Royal Military Police, featured in last year's Panorama, was into the death of Radhi Nama in British custody. The Royal Military Police concluded he had died of a heart attack - even though his body and face showed signs he had been beaten. To date, no one has been prosecuted in connection with Radhi Nama's death. His daughter, Afaf Radhi Nama, told Panorama: ""I saw torture signs on his body. ""They covered his head and tied his hands, he could not defend himself, and they killed him. It is my wish to see the soldiers who committed this crime put on trial and facing justice. ""If I was a British citizen my rights would be respected, but because I am an Iraqi citizen, it seems I have no rights."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the ICC review ""confirms that the UK is willing and able to investigate and prosecute claims of wrongdoing by armed forces personnel"". He said it had brought to light ""no new evidence"" and the ICC statement ""vindicates our efforts to pursue justice where allegations have been founded"". ""I am pleased that work we have done, and continue to do, in improving the quality and assurances around investigations has been recognised by the ICC,"" he said. ""The Service Justice System Review and the appointment of Sir Richard Henriques to provide assurance of our investigative processes are all steps towards making sure we have one of the best service justice systems in the world."""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51706225","Coronavirus: How the pandemic has changed the world economy",2021-01-24,"Lora Jones, Daniele Palumbo & David Brown","BBC News","The coronavirus pandemic has reached almost every country in the world. Its spread has left national economies and businesses counting the costs, as governments struggle with new lockdown measures to tackle the spread of the virus.  Despite the development of new vaccines, many are still wondering what recovery could look like.  Here is a selection of charts and maps to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far. Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (Isas). The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei all saw huge falls as the number of Covid-19 cases grew in the first months of the crisis. The major Asian and US stock markets have recovered following the announcement of the first vaccine in November, but the FTSE is still in negative territory. The FTSE dropped 14.3% in 2020, its worst performance since 2008. In response, central banks in many countries, including the UK, have slashed interest rates. That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy. Some markets recovered ground in January this year, but this is a normal tendency known as the ""January effect"".  Analysts are worried that the possibility of further lockdowns and delays in vaccination programmes might trigger more market volatility this year. Many people have lost their jobs or seen their incomes cut. Unemployment rates have increased across major economies. In the United States, the proportion of people out of work hit a yearly total of 8.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), signalling an end to a decade of jobs expansion. Millions of workers have also been put on government-supported job retention schemes as parts of the economy, such as tourism and hospitality, have come to a near standstill. The numbers of new job opportunities is still very low in many countries. Job vacancies in Australia have returned to the same level of 2019, but they are lagging in France, Spain, the UK and several other countries. Some experts have warned it could be years before levels of employment return to those seen before the pandemic. If the economy is growing, that generally means more wealth and more new jobs. It's measured by looking at the percentage change in gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced, typically over three months or a year. The IMF estimates that the global economy shrunk by 4.4% in 2020. The organisation described the decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The only major economy to grow in 2020 was China. It registered a growth of 2.3%. The IMF is, however, predicting global growth of 5.2% in 2021.  That will be driven primarily by countries such as India and China, forecast to grow by 8.8% and 8.2% respectively.  Recovery in big, services-reliant, economies that have been hit hard by the outbreak, such as the UK or Italy, is expected to be slow. The travel industry has been badly damaged, with airlines cutting flights and customers cancelling business trips and holidays. New variants of the virus - discovered only in recent months - have forced many countries to introduce tighter travel restrictions. Data from the flight tracking service Flight Radar 24 shows that the number of flights globally took a huge hit in 2020 and it is still a long way from recovery. The hospitality sector has been hit hard, with millions of jobs and many companies bankrupt. Data from Transparent - an industry-leading intelligence company that covers over 35 million hotel and rental listings worldwide - has registered a fall in reservations in all the top travel destinations. Billions of dollars have been lost in 2020 and although the forecast for 2021 is better, many analysts believe that international travel and tourism won't return to the normal pre-pandemic levels until around 2025. Retail footfall has seen unprecedented falls as shoppers stayed at home. New variants and surges in cases have made problems worse. Pedestrian numbers have fallen further from the first lockdown, according to research firm ShopperTrak,  Separate research suggests that consumers are still feeling anxious about their return to stores. Accountancy giant EY says 67% customers are now not willing to travel more than 5 kilometres for shopping.  This change in shopping behaviour has significantly boosted online retail, with a global revenue of $3.9 trillion in 2020. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and treatment options. Shares in some pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development have shot up. Moderna, Novavax and AstraZeneca have seen significant rises. But Pfizer has seen its share price fall. The partnership with BioNTech, the high cost of production and management of the vaccine, and the growing number of same-size competitors have reduced the investors' trust in the company to have bigger revenue in 2021. A number of pharmaceutical firms have started already distributing doses and many countries have started their vaccination programmes. Many more - such as Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi/GSK - will join the vaccine distribution during 2021."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65759630","South Africa plans law change over Putin ICC arrest warrant",2023-05-30,"Farouk Chothia and Robert Greenall","BBC News","South Africa plans to change its law so that it has the power to decide whether or not to arrest a leader wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), a deputy minister has told the BBC.  Obed Bapela's remarks come amid intense speculation over whether South Africa stands by its invitation to Russia's President Putin to visit in August.  The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Mr Putin over the Ukraine war. South Africa had earlier invited him to attend a summit of Brics leaders. Russia has not said whether Mr Putin plans to attend the summit. Meanwhile Pretoria has also granted diplomatic immunity to Russian officials attending, something that its foreign affairs department described as standard procedure. Brics is intended to strengthen ties between the nations that make it up -  Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. ""In June we'll be submitting the law in parliament,"" Obed Bapela, a deputy minister in the South African presidency, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme. Through the law, South Africa ""will give itself exemptions of who to arrest and who not to arrest,"" Mr Bapela said. Under its current laws, South Africa is obliged to arrest Mr Putin if he arrives on its shores, as it is a member of the ICC.  But South Africa has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, insisting it wants to remain neutral. The ICC issued its warrant for Mr Putin in March, accusing him of being responsible for war crimes - though Moscow has rejected such allegations. South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has launched a court application to compel the authorities to arrest Mr Putin should he arrive in August. Mr Bapela said that South Africa was also writing to the ICC about a waiver. This refers to article 98 of the Rome Statute, the treaty which established the court in 2002. While article 27 says no-one is immune from prosecution by the ICC, article 98 appears to suggest that the ICC could not ask South Africa to arrest the Russian leader unless Russia agreed to waive Mr Putin's immunity from prosecution. The deputy minister also lashed out at the ICC for its ""double standards"", saying the late Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first democratically elected president, would have been disappointed by the war crimes court. ""We never thought that the ICC that we have today will be what it is. They never indicted Tony Blair, they never indicted [George W] Bush for their killings of Iraq people,"" he said, referring to the former UK and US leaders and their invasion of Iraq in 2003. ""Mandela would have said [that] the inequality, the inconsistency by the ICC, is a problem."" Mr Bapela also pointed to past examples of exemptions of international justice, like the UK's decision not to extradite General Augusto Pinochet in 1998. The former Chilean dictator was arrested in London at the request of a Spanish judge seeking to put him on trial for human rights abuses during his 17-year rule, but the UK government freed him after 16 months on the advice of medical experts who said he was unfit to stand trial. He died back home in 2006."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-11108059",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Genocide is understood by most to be the gravest crime against humanity. It is defined as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - exemplified by the efforts of the Nazis to eradicate the Jewish population in the 1940s. But behind that simple definition is a complicated tangle of legal concepts concerning what constitutes genocide and when the term can be applied. The term genocide was coined in 1943 by the Jewish-Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who combined the Greek word ""genos"" (race or tribe) with the Latin word ""cide"" (to kill). After witnessing the horrors of the Holocaust, in which every member of his family except his brother was killed, Dr Lemkin campaigned to have genocide recognised as a crime under international law. His efforts gave way to the adoption of the United Nations Genocide Convention, external in December 1948, which came into effect in January 1951. Article Two of the convention defines genocide as ""any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such"": Killing members of the group Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group The convention also imposes a general duty on states that are signatories to ""prevent and to punish"" genocide. Since its adoption, the UN treaty has come under criticism from different sides, mostly by people frustrated with the difficulty of applying it to specific cases. Some have argued that the definition is too narrow; others that it is devalued by overuse.  Some analysts say the definition of genocide is so narrow that none of the mass killings perpetrated since the treaty's adoption would fall under it. The objections most frequently raised against the treaty include: The convention excludes targeted political and social groups  The definition is limited to direct acts against people, and excludes acts against the environment which sustains them or their cultural distinctiveness  Proving intention beyond reasonable doubt is extremely difficult  UN member states are hesitant to single out other members or intervene, as was the case in Rwanda  There is no body of international law to clarify the parameters of the convention (though this is changing as UN war crimes tribunals issue indictments)  The difficulty of defining or measuring ""in part"", and establishing how many deaths equal genocide  But in spite of these criticisms, there are many who say genocide is recognisable.  In his book Rwanda and Genocide in the 20th Century, the former secretary-general of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Alain Destexhe, wrote: ""Genocide is distinguishable from all other crimes by the motivation behind it.  ""Genocide is a crime on a different scale to all other crimes against humanity and implies an intention to completely exterminate the chosen group. Genocide is therefore both the gravest and greatest of the crimes against humanity."" Mr Destexhe has voiced concern that the term genocide has fallen victim to ""a sort of verbal inflation, in much the same way as happened with the word fascist"", becoming ""dangerously commonplace"". Michael Ignatieff, former director of the Carr Centre for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University, has agreed, arguing that the term has come to be used as a ""validation of every kind of victimhood"". ""Slavery, for example, is called genocide when - whatever it was, and it was an infamy - it was a system to exploit, rather than to exterminate the living,"" Mr Ignatieff said in a lecture. The differences over how genocide should be defined have also led to disagreements on how many genocides occurred during the 20th Century. Some say there was only one genocide in the last century: the Holocaust. Others say there have been at least three genocides as defined by the terms of the 1948 UN convention: The mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks between 1915-1920, an accusation that the Turks deny  The Holocaust, during which more than six million Jews were killed  Rwanda, where an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus died in the 1994 genocide  And in recent years, other cases have been added to the list by some. In Bosnia, the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica has been ruled to be genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).  Other cases include the Soviet man-made famine of Ukraine (1932-33), the Indonesian invasion of East Timor (1975), and the Khmer Rouge killings in Cambodia in the 1970s, during which an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians died by execution, starvation, or forced labour. There is disagreement over the fact that many of the victims of the Khmer Rouge were targeted because of their political or social status - putting them outside of the UN definition of genocide. The International Criminal Court in 2010 issued an arrest warrant for the President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, on genocide charges, accusing him of waging a campaign against the citizens of the Sudanese region of Darfur where about 300,000 people are said to have died and millions more displaced during seven years of fighting. More recently, in March 2016, the US accused the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) of carrying out genocide against Christian, Yazidi and Shia minorities in Iraq and Syria. IS was ""genocidal by self-proclamation, by ideology and by actions, in what it says, what it believes and what it does,"" then-Secretary of State John Kerry said. In 2017, The Gambia submitted a case to the International Court of Justice accusing Myanmar of carrying out a genocide against the Rohingya people, alleging ""widespread and systematic clearance operations"" in Rohingya villages.  Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people have fled Myanmar into bordering Bangladesh and elsewhere, and thousands are reported to have been killed. In 2021, the US, Canadian and Dutch governments all formerly accused China of committing a genocide against the Uighur people in Xinjiang, while several other countries brought parliamentary resolutions making the same accusation. Evidence suggests China has subjected the Uighurs to forced sterilisation, forced labour, mass detention, and systematic rape and torture - actions which many say meet the criteria of a genocide. China denies the charges. Report: 'Credible case' China is carrying out genocide The first case to put into practice the convention on genocide was that of Jean Paul Akayesu, the Hutu mayor of the Rwandan town of Taba at the time of the killings. In a landmark ruling, a special international tribunal convicted Akayesu of genocide and crimes against humanity on 2 September 1998. More than 85 people were subsequently convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, 29 on counts of genocide. In August 2010, a leaked UN report alleged that Rwandan Hutus, perpetrators of the 1994 genocide, may themselves have been victims of the same crime. In 2001, Gen Radislav Krstic, a former Bosnian Serb general, became the first person to be convicted of genocide at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Krstic appealed against his conviction, arguing that the 8,000 people killed constituted ""too insignificant"" a number to be a genocide. In 2004 the ICTY rejected his appeal. In 2007, the former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladić, nicknamed the ""butcher of Bosnia"", was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. And in 2018, Nuon Chea, 92, and Khieu Samphan, 87, were both sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide and crimes against humanity for their roles in the Khmer Rouge killings.   "

The 31-year-old centre-back made 102 appearances for his country between 2009 and 2018, scoring five times. He was part of the Spain team that won their first World Cup in 2010, before adding the 2012 European Championship.   His appearances were often greeted with jeers and whistles by Spanish fans, partly because of his support for Catalonia's independence referendum.  Sevilla threaten to withdraw from Super Cup in row over Barca's non-EU players Catalonia, a region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain, has its own language and culture and Barcelona is its capital. Pique had declared his intention to quit international football after the 2018 World Cup following a qualifier against Albania in October 2016, when he said he was tired of criticism and wanted ""to be left in peace"". He remains a divisive figure within Spain, and has often been critical of Barca's club rivals Real Madrid. Pique did not immediately confirm his retirement following Spain's exit from the World Cup, when they lost on penalties to hosts Russia in the last 16.  His expected decision comes despite former Barca boss Luis Enrique having since been appointed Spain's manager. ""I spoke to Luis Enrique a few days ago. He called me and I told him the decision was taken a long time ago and that I had thought about it carefully,"" Pique said on Saturday.  ""It was a beautiful time with the national team in which I had the chance to win the World Cup and the European Championship. Now I want to focus on Barca,"" he added.  ""I have a few years left here and I'm going to enjoy them a lot."" Barca, who won the Spanish double last season, play Sevilla in the Spanish Super Cup in Tangier, Morocco, on Sunday at 21:00 BST. "
"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-58668608","Construction work starts on new Type 31 warships",2021-09-23,NA,NA,"Work has officially started on a £1.25bn project to build five new warships for the Royal Navy. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace cut the first steel for the first Type 31 frigate - HMS Venturer - due to be built by Babcock at Rosyth in Fife. The fleet's construction will support about 1,250 highly skilled jobs at Babcock and lead to an additional 150 apprenticeships. It is also expected to support a further 1,250 UK supply chain roles. At £250m per vessel, the Type 31 is a smaller, cheaper frigate than the Type 26 warships currently being built at the Upper Clyde shipyards. The Type 31 will undertake a variety of operational roles, including interception and disruption of illegal activity at sea, intelligence gathering and defence engagement. They will replace the five general-purpose Type-23 frigates currently in service with the Royal Navy.  The Babcock team's Arrowhead 140 design beat competition from a Cammell Laird/BAE Systems consortium and a bid led by Atlas Elektronik UK to secure the build contract. Mr Wallace described the steel-cutting event as a ""great milestone in the renaissance of British shipbuilding"". He said: ""Today is a momentous occasion for the Type 31 programme, defence and the shipbuilding industry in Scotland.  ""As Shipbuilding Tsar, to cut the steel for the first of five new frigates that will be constructed here on our shores in the Firth of the Forth, providing jobs and innovation to the area, is a tremendous honour."" The Type 31 will have advanced capabilities fitted onboard, including a supersonic anti-air missile defence system, as well as Bofors naval guns and a 4D radar system. There will also be space to house a Royal Navy helicopter. Known as the Inspiration class, the five Type 31 vessels all take their names from former warships and submarines whose missions and history are intended to inspire Royal Navy operations. Second Sea Lord Vice Admiral Nick Hine said: ""The Type 31 represents the very best of British shipbuilding, and with its modular design will be configurable to meet the needs of both the Royal Navy and our allies around the world, now and into the future."" The entire Type 31 fleet is expected to be delivered by the end of 2028 and to enter service with the Royal Navy by the end of 2030, with the first expected in the water in 2023. The vessels will each carry a crew of up to 105 that will be deployed on duties around the world, working alongside new Type 26 frigates. It's a lot cheaper, with a budget of no more than £250m per ship. It's lighter and carries less sophisticated weaponry than the Type 26 being built on the Clyde. The hull design was based on one developed for the Danish navy. And in turn, the design is being exported by Babcock to spread the cost of development.  Indonesia is the first country to sign up for two ships, to be built by one of its own shipyards. The choice of Rosyth followed a convoluted process of procurement - reversing a decision that would have put all the Royal Navy's fighting ship orders into Clyde yards, and trying to get more competition between private shipbuilders. Babcock beat Merseyside's Cammell Laird (working with BAE Systems on the Clyde) in the final run-off. It has since invested in an assembly hall with robotic welding, that should make it a formidable rival to the Clyde yards for orders beyond the Types 26 and 31. The impression was given, with the new shipbuilding strategy, that the Type 31 would benefit yards all over the UK, using modular design in the same way the aircraft carriers were built.  The Babcock bid initially included Ferguson Marine in Inverclyde and Harland and Wolff in Belfast, but both fell out of that consortium when they got into financial difficulties. It's looking a lot less like a UK-wide shipbuilding strategy now. The construction of the five Type 31 hulls will be in Fife. Much of the value will be in the supply chain for weapons, engines and systems. But Babcock's pricing is based on doing the shipbuilding itself."

The credit card-sized devices are heading to the International Space Station (ISS) to carry out experiments programmed by school pupils. It is part of a project by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Cambridge-based Raspberry Pi Foundation (RPF). Olympia Brown, from the RPF, said the computers would be ""with the all of astronauts' Christmas presents"". The new machines will replace older, less-advanced models, called Ed and Izzy, that were originally deployed as part of Tim Peake's Principia mission in 2015. Children and teenagers were being asked to write simple computer codes, using information from the ESA, to conduct an experiment for the ISS computers. The project, called Astro Pi, is aimed at primary schoolchildren and it aimed to encourage more young people to become interested in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects.   It runs until 18 March and is suitable for children as young as six, the ESA said. Ms Brown, the head of youth partnerships at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, said an example of the code pupils could write would be to create ""a message that will be seen by the astronauts"" on the ISS. She said communication with the astronauts was not an issue as ""the International Space Station does have wi-fi"". The ESA said the two Raspberry Pi computers were housed in a special case that was suitable for space.  They also had an additional component called the Sense HAT, which has a joystick, LED display, camera and sensors for recording lighting conditions, temperature, humidity, pressure and orientation. The RPF was set up to help more young get into coding, and led to development of the bare-bones computer. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Planeloads of ventilators, medicines and oxygen equipment began pouring into India, from countries including the UK and the US, at the start of last week. By Sunday, some 300 tonnes of supplies on 25 flights had arrived at Delhi International Airport alone. But - as cases continue to reach record levels across the country - concerns are mounting about delays in supplying the aid to those most in need. For several days, much of the cargo sat in airport hangars as hospitals called for more support. The supplies did not begin being distributed until as late as Monday evening - more than a week after the first batch of emergency assistance arrived, state officials have told local media. The Indian government has strongly denied there is a delay, issuing a statement on Tuesday evening saying it had introduced a ""streamlined and systematic mechanism"" for distributing the supplies. The health ministry said in the statement it was ""working 24x7 to fast track and clear the goods"". But on the ground, officials in some of India's worst-hit states told the BBC that they had still not received any supplies. Kerala - which recorded a record 37,190 new Covid cases earlier this week - had still not received any aid by Wednesday evening, the state's health secretary, Dr Rajan Khobragade, told the BBC. Kerala's chief minister, Prinarayi Vijayan, separately called on India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""urgently"" send Kerala some of the country's much-needed oxygen imports.  He asked that the equipment ""be allotted to Kerala on a priority basis, considering the fact that Kerala has one of the highest active case loads in the country"", in an open letter to Mr Modi on Wednesday. Some healthcare officials claim there has been little to no communication from the central government on how or when they would receive supplies. ""There's still no information about where it is being distributed,"" said Dr Harsh Mahajan, the president of the Healthcare Federation of India, which represents some of the country's biggest private hospitals.  ""It seems people don't know - I've tried two or three places and been unable to find out,"" he added. ""It's still not clear."" Some non-governmental groups involved in responding to the crisis also say they are frustrated by an apparent lack of information. ""I don't think anybody has any clarity on where aid is going,"" Pankaj Anand, Oxfam India's director of programme and advocacy, told the BBC. ""There is no tracker on any website giving you an answer."" An alleged absence of information about the relief distribution effort is raising questions - even in foreign donor countries - about where the aid is going. On Friday, the issue was raised at a US state department briefing, when a reporter demanded ""accountability for the US taxpayers' money"" being sent to India, and asked if the US government was tracking the aid's whereabouts.  ""Rest assured that the United States is committed to making sure that our partners in India are taken care of in this crisis,"" the state department's spokesperson said in response. The BBC asked the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office if it had any knowledge of where the country's aid - including its shipments of more than 1,000 ventilators - had been distributed.   In response the FCDO said ""the UK has been working with the Indian Red Cross and Government of India to ensure transfer of medical equipment from the UK is as efficient as possible"".  ""Distribution processes and decisions on exactly where support provided by the UK will be deployed are matters for the Government of India."" Opposition politicians in India have also called for the government to release more information about how its relief effort is going.""We request and demand from the government... Share it with every Indian: Where has this aid come from, and where is it going?"" said Pawan Khera, a spokesperson for the opposition Congress party. ""You owe it to the public."" It took the Indian government seven days to create a ""streamlined mechanism"" to distribute supplies to states, according to the health ministry.  It began work on the plan on 26 April, and issued its Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - guidelines on how to distribute aid - on 2 May, it said in a press release. It did not say when aid distribution began. Even when shipments land in India, the distribution process is complex - involving various stages, ministries and outside agencies. After relief flights arrive, aid is received by the Indian Red Cross Society, which is responsible for taking it through customs, according to the government's statement. The shipments are then handed over to another agency, HLL Lifecare, which handles the goods and subsequently transports them across the country.  Because supplies are arriving in various forms, authorities have to ""unpack [and] repack"" them before they can be dispatched, further slowing the process, the government admits. ""The materials from abroad are currently coming in different numbers, specifications and at different times,"" the government said. ""In many cases the items received are not as per the list, or the quantities differ, which needs reconciling at the airport."" Once the materials are repacked, they are allocated to areas where ""critical care patients load is high and where the need is highest"". Despite the logistical challenges, India's central government says it is ""working 24x7"" to send supplies to strained areas. It said aid had been dispatched to some 38 institutions in 31 states by Tuesday evening. One badly-hit state, Punjab, has received 100 oxygen concentrators and 2,500 doses of the life-saving drug remdesivir, a state official told the BBC on Wednesday. The air force airlifted the ""first batch"" of 450 oxygen cylinders from the UK to Chennai (Madras) in southern Tamil Nadu state on Tuesday, the city's customs authority said on Twitter. Of 1,088 oxygen concentrators flown in from Hong Kong, some 738 remained in Delhi while 350 had been sent on Mumbai, a government minister said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, trainloads of oxygen - nicknamed the ""Oxygen Express"" by officials - are being rushed to Delhi to help ease shortages in its hospitals. Despite these efforts, India's hospitals are still in dire need of fresh medical supplies - and above all of oxygen. The country reported a record 412,262 new daily coronavirus cases on Thursday and 3,980 virus-related deaths, the health ministry said. India accounted for nearly half of all reported Covid infections across the world last week, and a quarter of all deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Yet some healthcare professionals say what they need most urgently are not the foreign donations, but more on-site oxygen production facilities to be built at hospitals. ""Right now our only problem is oxygen,"" says Dr Mahajan. ""Even if this aid comes or doesn't come, I don't think it's going to make a substantial difference. The oxygen generators will make the difference. That's what is most essential right now."" Two freshly installed medical oxygen plants - producing 1,000 litres per minute - would begin pumping supplies to hundreds of Covid-19 patients in Delhi on Wednesday evening, the health ministry said in a tweet. But for many of those on the frontline of India's healthcare emergency, the wait for desperately needed support continues. ""It is frustrating,"" Dr Mahajan says. ""We are overwhelmed... this wave has hit us, the incline has hit us - [and] it's like a jet taking off."" Additional reporting by the BBC's Soutik Biswas and Andrew Clarance in Delhi "

The victim with the most serious wounds is now out of danger, police said. They believe the suspect is still armed with the chainsaw. Police released a new photo of Franz Wrousis on Tuesday and said he had convictions for weapons offences in 2014 and 2016. ""Anyone who sees him should avoid him,"" a spokesman warned. They said he had been wearing the same green jacket shown in the picture and that he was carrying three bags, including a black bin-type bag thought to contain the chainsaw. Swiss search after chainsaw attack Police with dogs spent the night searching an area close to the German border.  However, officials in the German state of Baden-Württemberg said there was no evidence that the suspect had left Switzerland.  The suspect was said to have lived in local forests close to the border for some time, and photos issued by police on Monday showed a man of dishevelled appearance. The attack unfolded shortly after 10:30 (08:30 GMT) on Monday, when two workers were attacked and wounded by a chainsaw at the CSS insurance office. One was badly hurt and needed surgery in hospital.

Four former youth team players are taking the Premier League club to the High Court next year seeking damages and losses caused by sexual abuse, emotional abuse and assaults by Williams and former coach and player Graham Rix.  Williams, also Chelsea's former academy director, has previously denied ""any and all allegations of abuse"" and said he ""did not act in a racist way towards any youth or other player"" at Chelsea.  Rix has denied he is ""bullying, aggressive or racist"".     Representing insurers for Chelsea during a pre-trial hearing, Michael Kent QC said Williams had used ""language referring to a player's colour but had no recollection of [specific] words"" referred to in the hearing.  He also said Williams, who left Chelsea in 2006, would ""never use these words today"" and said there was ""no malicious intention behind them"" and that he had ""no intention to cause harm"". Lawyers for Chelsea's insurers deny the allegations made against the club.  Kent added: ""This isn't one or two alternative scenarios, this is a case of a court having to evaluate accounts 25 years after the event and seeking to reach a threshold to allow the court to say this was intentional infliction of injury.""  But representing the four claimants, James Counsell QC said the denial was a ""reversal"" in the club's stance since it apologised for the claims made against Williams and Rix in a 2019 Barnardo's investigation.   Presiding over the pre-trial hearing, Mrs Justice Stacey said the allegations made for ""extremely shocking reading, if true"".  The case is set to be heard at the High Court for 15 days in March 2022.  The four players say Chelsea is ""vicariously liable for the assaults committed by Williams and Rix"" when the players were between 14 and 18 years of age.  They also claim that the ""assaults, aggravated by the racist language and behaviour, also constituted breaches, on the part of these two coaches, of their duty of care to boys in their charge, for which Chelsea was responsible."" They also say Chelsea was ""in breach of its duty directly for failing to take steps to prevent the culture of racist abuse which existed at Chelsea at that time"".  Lawyers representing the players say they have ""suffered serious psychiatric injuries and other psychological symptoms which have affected them throughout their adult lives as a result of the constant humiliation and offensive behaviour to which they were subjected over a lengthy part of their formative years.""  In 2019, Chelsea apologised to ""all players who had experienced this deeply shocking behaviour"", following a Barnardo's report which found that Williams was ""an instigator"" of racial abuse and Rix could be ""aggressive and bullying"" but not ""racially abusive"".  But in advance of the High Court case, lawyers representing the club's insurers, Keoghs, submitted a 'non-admission' plea, meaning it was up to the claimants to prove the case.  Counsell said the club's representatives are now denying the allegations based on subsequent witness statements and summaries.  Counsell said: ""From a public position of regret from the Barnardo's report and then non-admission in pleading and then in witness evidence to outright denial, the defendant [Chelsea] has entirely reversed its decision. ""It's quite clear that the defendant has changed its position since getting witness statements from Williams and Rix. ""It's also not clear from statements which of the allegations are being denied or accepted."""

The change means Swindon Town WFC will play some matches this season at the County Ground.  The club play in the FA National Women's League Division One South West, the fourth tier of women's football.  Swindon hope the move will grow the women's team's fanbase and inspire more girls to take up the sport.  ""Sustainable is one thing for us, but it's an absolute game-changing move for Swindon Town Women. It's very much the start of a new era for us,"" Hartley told BBC Radio Wiltshire. ""It means that the running of the club will be integrated over time with the whole club at Swindon Town and it will make the club more inclusive, more accessible and hopefully will see us playing more games at Foundation Park and the County Ground."" Swindon Town WFC was founded in 1993 - then under the name Swindon Town Ladies - and while they have long been affiliated with their male counterparts, the women's side has been run independently of the men's team.  Home matches have been played almost exclusively at Cinder Lane, the home of Gloucestershire neighbours Fairford Town, in recent years rather than in Swindon itself.  Yet the team have played the first two matches of the new campaign at Foundation Park, Swindon Town's training complex and community facility, both of which they won. ""From a training facilities perspective we use Foundation Park right next to the County Ground at the moment, so that is really valuable for us,"" Hartley said. ""From a personnel point of view it's about collaboration and joining things up. The more and more connections and more and more dots to join just adds strength to us. ""In the short term we'll see and hear more of Swindon Town Women, both through our channels online. But because we're able to play more games at Foundation Park this season there's just more of an opportunity to come along and watch."" Hartley pointed to Swindon Town owner Clem Morfuni, who took over the club last summer, and CEO Rob Angus as being invaluable to getting the two clubs working closer together. ""Their help and vision to see Swindon Town Women become part of the club is fantastic. I think with my role being a new one, as director of football, plus all of the efforts of the existing volunteer committee, has just led to this point where actually we can move the club forward in a way we have never been able to before.""  The long-term ambition is to see Swindon Town Women move up the football pyramid. ""The most important thing from that is we've had 200 people come along to each game which is on a par with attendances from the league above,"" Hartley added.

However, what started out as a pro-Putin call to action has since been taken over by critics.  The hashtag, which translates as #RussiaNeedsPutin, began as a choreographed political campaign by accounts linked to the ruling United Russia party ahead of the presidential election this year.  The tweets praised Mr Putin's ability to unite the country and his role in guiding Russia through the turbulent post-cold war years.  The hashtag has been among the top trending topics on Russian social media since 14 January, and has been used almost 7,000 times on Twitter in the same period.  Although Mr Putin is running as an independent candidate rather than from United Russia, party-linked accounts began using the tag to coincide with efforts to collect signatures in support of Mr Putin's campaign for re-election.  You may also like:  Mr Putin needs 300,000 signatures from across the country to secure his place on the ballot for the election on 18 March.  Many included the hashtag when posting photos of themselves pledging their support to the President at a number of registration points.  Vladimir Putin has been in power, either as the Prime Minister or President, since the year 2000 and enjoys huge popularity with many Russians.  However, those critical of the President seized the popularity of the hashtag to highlight issues facing the country and the restriction of political freedoms within it.  A critic wrote: ""Russia needs roads, education, medicine, to fight against corruption, gasification, free higher education, alternation of power, parliamentary regime, freedom of enterprise and free media. This is what Russia needs and not Putin."" One Twitter user mocked those extolling Mr Putin's virtues:  ""Don't know about you, but I want more violation of my constitutional rights, I want our country to degrade me and the people to become even more stupid. Mr Putin, may Russian Christ protect you!"" ""Corruption, rampant corruption, citizens' rights abuse, nominating only the 'right' people as candidates, ignoring public opinion, police brutality, low wages, arresting people at peaceful demos, yesyesyes, #RussiaNeedsPutin"" The rise and origins of the hashtag have sparked questions about the role of pro-Kremlin bots in amplifying the popularity of the term. Russian-backed accounts have previously been accused of manipulating conversations on social media and running disinformation campaigns. "

Jihyun Park, 52, who faced starvation, torture and persecution before coming to the UK, has been chosen for Holyrood ward in Bury, Greater Manchester.  The prospective Conservative candidate, who settled in Bury in 2008, campaigns for the rights of North Koreans. Ms Park is believed to be the first person of North Korean descent to stand for election in the UK. She escaped from the country in 1998 and later became a British citizen after suffering forced repatriation in China. Ms Park fled to the Chinese border with her brother after their father and uncle died of starvation when famine struck. She became a victim of human trafficking and was sold into forced marriage to a Chinese farmer, with whom she had a child. In 2004, she was arrested and sent back to North Korea, where she faced torture and persecution in a forced labour camp but she was thrown out when they thought she was close to death with gangrene. A stranger nursed her back to health and helped her to escape and reunite with her son. Ms Park is now a language tutor living in the Fairfield area of Bury, and campaigns for the rights of all North Koreans to live without fear of torture and persecution, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reports. She said:  ""In comparison my life in the UK is heaven"". Bury Conservative Association, tweeted: ""We're so proud that, to our knowledge, Jihyun is the first ever North Korean defector to stand for local elections in Britain."" The Holyrood ward is currently held by three Liberal Democrat councillors with sitting councillor Steve Wright defending his seat. Labour has announced former councillor Noel Bayley will be standing for the party."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64072575","Russia may send empty Soyuz to bring ISS crew home",2022-12-23,NA,NA,"Russia's space agency says it is considering sending an empty spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) to bring home three crew members ahead of schedule, after their Soyuz capsule started leaking. Roscosmos and Nasa said it was unclear how the external radiator on the spacecraft sustained a tiny puncture. They have ruled out the impact of a meteor. The leak started as two cosmonauts were preparing for a routine spacewalk. A decision is yet to be made about how exactly the three crew members will be brought back to Earth.  The most likely option is to send another Soyuz spacecraft to collect them. A less likely option is sending them home in the leaky capsule without most of its coolant, which regulates temperatures inside the crew compartment of the spacecraft. The vehicle - known as MS-22 - flew Russian cosmonauts Dmitry Petelin and Sergey Prokopyev, as well as Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio, to the station in September. But it began spraying coolant into space earlier this month, with Nasa TV capturing dramatic images of white particles streaming out of the capsule like snowflakes. Joel Montalbano, Nasa's ISS program manager, said late February would be the most likely time to launch another Soyuz. The crew were due to return in March.  Nasa says that none of the crew are in danger.  The capsule is currently being vented with air flow allowed through an open hatch to the space station, Mr Montalbano said. The ISS was launched in 1998 and is located about 400 km from the Earth. Cosmonauts carry out tests and research at the station that will help future space missions."

Two late goals from substitute Kaoru Mitoma in Sydney sealed Japan's place in Qatar with a game to spare. Victory lifted Japan top of Group B of Asian qualifying, above Saudi Arabia who are four points clear of Australia. Australia now face a play-off campaign to reach a fifth successive World Cup. The Socceroos next face Saudi Arabia in Jeddah in what is now a dead rubber on Tuesday, before going on to face the country that finishes third in Group A in a play-off game on 7 June. With two group games to go, the United Arab Emirates are third in that group, three points ahead of Lebanon, while Iraq are a further point adrift. The winner of that tie goes on to a play-off against the fifth-placed team from South America. Japan needed to beat Australia on home soil for the first time since 1998 to progress, and appeared to be heading towards a frustrating draw against a Covid-19-hit Socceroos side before Mitoma came off the bench to break the deadlock in the 90th minute. Takumi Minamino had hit the crossbar twice in the first-half, and then had an 80th-minute effort from six yards cleared off the line by Trent Sainsbury. Winger Mitoma replaced the Liverpool forward in the 84th minute and pounced on a cut-back pass soon after to beat goalkeeper Mat Ryan and spark wild celebration from the visitors. Mitoma then put the result and qualification beyond doubt five minutes later when he skipped through the tiring Australia defence and beat Ryan again."

Members of Unison, including security staff, firefighters and cleaners, will be balloted at the airport in North Lincolnshire over the next two weeks. The union said its members at the site ""were paid significantly lower than their counterparts"" at Manchester and Leeds Bradford airports. Humberside Airport said it was ""disappointed at this response"".  Unison said staff earning around £21,000 had been offered an 8.4% increase, while those earning around £27,000 were offered a rise of 6.5%, and a 5.1% increase was offered to workers earning around £35,000. George Ayre, the union's regional organiser, said: ""This vote by members shows they still don't feel valued by their employer.   ""Air traffic controllers were paid a higher unconsolidated payment, which, to our members, suggests their work is not as valued as those working in air traffic control. ""A higher pay offer would not only be an investment in staff, but an investment in Humberside Airport overall,"" he added. If approved by Unison members at the airport, any strike action was likely to take place in the autumn, the union said. A spokesperson for Humberside Airport said: ""We are disappointed at this response, particularly after Unison advised members to accept this offer. ""We have yet to be formally advised of any ballot to strike and we hope Unison will continue talks about resolving this issue and avoiding unnecessary disruption to Humberside passengers."" Humberside Airport is located near the village of Kirmington. There are daily flights from there to Amsterdam, as well as a number of seasonal routes to holiday destinations.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/education-50563833","Pisa tests: UK rises in international school rankings",2019-12-03,"Sean Coughlan","BBC News family and education correspondent","The UK has made ""positive"" progress in international school rankings, based on tests taken by 15-year-olds in 79 countries and regions. The Pisa tests, run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, show the UK rising in reading, maths and science. But the UK lags behind top performers such as China, Singapore and Estonia. The UK's teenagers were also found to have among the lowest levels of ""life satisfaction"". Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, said there were ""positive signals"" from the UK's results for the tests taken in 2018 - which he said showed ""modest improvements"". The UK's maths results represent a particular improvement on three years ago, according to an analysis by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). But it says there has been no significant change for reading or science, with scores remaining broadly similar in Pisa tests since 2006, despite fluctuations in rankings. This year's science score has shown a slight fall, in fact, but because other countries' results have also slipped, the UK has climbed upwards in the rankings. At the current rate of progress, Mr Schleicher said, it would take a ""very long time"" for the UK to catch up with the highest achieving countries. He suggested more investment in teachers' skills as a way to make improvements. The global trend shows Asian school systems such as China and Singapore getting the best results, with Estonia and Finland among the highest achieving European countries and Canada performing strongly. China is top for all subjects - but its score is calculated using results from just four of its provinces, Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with a combined population of about 180 million. Mr Schleicher said these Chinese provinces were very effective at making sure all pupils, including the disadvantaged, reach a high level. And even the most deprived 10% of pupils in these provinces had better results than the average for the UK. Within the UK's four devolved education systems, England was the highest achiever in all three subjects. Wales remained the lowest performing within the UK for all subjects, with Scotland better than Northern Ireland at reading and Northern Ireland outperforming Scotland at maths and science. In reading tests, Wales scored below the average for OECD countries, while England, Scotland and Northern Ireland were all above average. Despite a decade of changes in school policy in England and Scotland and different political directions, the scores in this year's reading tests remained very similar for the two education systems, as they were a decade before. As well as gathering academic test results, there were also questions about teenagers' wellbeing. And the UK had some of the lowest scores of any country for ""life satisfaction"" and for feeling they had ""meaning"" in their lives. In England, 66% of young people said they were sometimes or always worried - compared with an OECD average of 50%. Mr Schleicher said more than many other countries, UK schools had a strong culture of individual competition rather than co-operation. The Pisa tests are the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment, in which the ability of 15-year-olds is tested every three years in reading, maths and science. They are voluntary but an increasing number of countries take part, wanting to see how their pupils compare by international standards. The tests have become an influential measure of education standards, offering a different perspective from national exams. The rankings are based on samples of pupils in each country - with about 600,000 pupils having taken this round of tests. The UK's figures are based on a sample of about 14,000 pupils taking tests in almost 460 schools. ""Pupils in England have continued to perform well in reading and science and have made significant improvement in maths,"" said Carole Willis, chief executive of the NFER, which published an official analysis of the UK results. But she called for more investigation into why ""pupils in England were more likely to have negative feelings"". Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, warned during an election campaign there was a risk of ""over-claiming or over-blaming"" about these results. But he said attention should be paid to the low levels of wellbeing and the ""great pressure"" experienced by teenagers. Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, said: ""We need to do more to narrow the gap between rich and poor students, particularly for the highest performing ones."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the rise in the rankings reflected the efforts of Conservative governments to have ""more rigorous primary school assessments and more pupils are now studying the core academic subjects at GCSE"".   But Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union, said it was too early to draw any conclusions about the Conservatives' changes to education from these results. Paul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers said teachers and school leaders deserved credit for the results ""given the very difficult circumstances in which they have been forced to operate over the past 10 years""."

Man in an Orange Shirt, written by novelist Patrick Gale, won the TV movie/mini-series prize at Monday's awards ceremony in New York. Goodbye Aleppo, a BBC film documenting the work of citizen journalists in Syria, took home the documentary prize. Sherlock star Lars Mikkelsen won the best actor prize for playing a priest in Danish drama Ride Upon the Storm. Germany's Anna Schudt won the female equivalent for playing Gaby Koster, a comedian afflicted by a stroke, in The Sniffles Would Have Been Fine. Broadcast on BBC Two last year, Man in an Orange Shirt told of two gay romances - one in the years following World War Two and the other in present-day London. Vanessa Redgrave was a member of the cast of the two-part drama, which saw Gale make his screenwriting debut. Spanish crime yarn Money Heist (La Casa de Papel) won the drama series prize at the ceremony, hosted by comedian Hari Kondabolu. Presented annually by the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, the International Emmys honour TV made outside the US. This year's event saw 11 awards presented to shows from 10 countries. Two special prizes were also given to producer Greg Berlanti and Sophie Turner Laing, CEO of media company Endemol Shine.

First Minister Arlene Foster confirmed the executive had agreed the plan on Thursday. People arriving from countries not on the government's travel corridors list will also still have to self-isolate for 10 days. The move has already been agreed in the Republic of Ireland. Passengers arriving there will be subject to the new rules from Saturday, with the measure taking effect in England and Scotland from Monday. Negative tests 72 hours prior to arrival are already a requirement in the Republic of Ireland for passengers travelling from Great Britain and South Africa. Speaking at Stormont's press conference on Thursday, the first minister said Northern Ireland's R-number had also fallen to between 0.7 and 0.9 for new cases of the virus. The reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the drop showed the ""very real"" effect of lockdown restrictions imposed on 26 December, but she warned there was still ""no room for complacency"". She said she still believed there needed to be an ""two-island approach"" to travel restrictions, including discussions with the British and Irish governments as a ""matter of urgency"". Mrs Foster said Stormont ministers had also expressed frustration at the executive meeting over a lack of data-sharing from authorities in the Republic of Ireland, and called for it to be escalated. PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said 40 penalty notices a day are being handed out to those who breach the Covid-19 regulations. He told the press briefing that if people continued flouting rules, they could expect ""firm and swift enforcement"". ""We won't turn a blind eye when people break the rules."" On Thursday, 16 more deaths related to Covid-19 were reported by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 1,533.  There have been 973 new cases diagnosed in the past 24 hours, while 58 Covid-19 patients are being treated in ICUs across Northern Ireland, of which 44 are on ventilators.  Mrs Foster said she found it ""incredible and frankly unbelievable"" that some people were still holding house parties and gatherings, despite the pandemic rates and the lockdown.  On Wednesday, health officials warned that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of the virus are rising. Mr Swann said that meant more ""difficult decisions"" on lockdown restrictions could be required. Northern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. The executive is due to review the current restrictions on 21 January. The first and deputy first ministers said they would take evidence from health officials before deciding whether an extension of the lockdown would be required. Ministers have also expressed concerns about some larger retailers ""gaming"" the regulations and keeping open non-essential parts of their businesses. A meeting between the first and deputy first ministers and representatives of the retail sector is due to happen on Friday afternoon. Elsewhere, the Chief Medical Officer has confirmed that unpaid carers looking after Clinically Extremely Vulnerable individuals should receive the first dose of their vaccine when phase two of the vaccination programme begins next month. Dr Michael McBride told Stormont's Health Committee they are provided for on a list of prioritisation provided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which decides the order of vaccination delivery. Mr Swann was asked if his department was ""putting all its eggs in the vaccine basket"". He said it was ""not the entirety of the answer"", adding: ""It will take time for the benefits of it to bed in. ""And while it is doing it, we still have to follow those restrictions that are in place. ""We may actually have to introduce more."" On Thursday afternoon the department tweeted that 121,711 vaccines have been administered in Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster said that by end of this month, it is hoped all care home residents, health staff and those aged over 80 in Northern Ireland will have received their first vaccination. She said that would be an ""incredible achievement"" and make Northern Ireland one of the top-performing countries in rolling out its vaccination programme.  Meanwhile, the chairman of the Police Federation for NI (PFNI) has said officers need more powers to enforce Covid-19 regulations. At present officers can only issue guidance and advice on the public health regulations. PFNI chairman Mark Lindsay said that puts officers in a ""difficult position"". The federation represents thousands of rank and file PSNI officers. ""I think we are well past the stage where police officers are the people that should be giving advice around the guidance,"" Mr Lindsay told BBC Radio Foyle."

The prime minister is facing a possible Commons defeat after cutting spending of national income on international development from 0.7% to 0.5%. David Davis - among more than 30 Tories against the move - said some UK-backed schemes have already been cancelled and ""morally, this is a devastating thing"". The government's supporters say the cut is temporary, necessary and popular. The Conservative Party committed to spending 0.7% in its manifesto for the 2019 general election - but ministers say it is hard to justify given record levels of peacetime borrowing during the pandemic.  The cut amounts to almost £4bn, but the government said it will still spend more than £10bn on foreign aid in 2021.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme if the government were to offer a compromise of a short time frame for their cut to foreign aid spending, ""it helps"".

The bill is due to be scrutinised in the Commons on Monday afternoon - but it will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether the rebels' amendment should be put to a vote. BBC politics correspondent Iain Watson says the government is confident the Speaker will rule that the amendment is not sufficiently connected to the bill and therefore will not be debated.

It is not certain that the Speaker of the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle will allow a vote to go ahead later, but if he does, the numbers look very tricky for the government. First, plenty of backbenchers, and also privately some in the government, think that cutting aid right now is simply the wrong thing to do as a matter of principle.

""We know that people are feeling the impact of rising prices, caused by global economic factors, triggered by the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" a HM Treasury spokesperson said in a statement, adding that help for households included £400 off energy bills plus personal tax cuts worth up to £330 a year. The IMF has cut its 2022 global growth forecast to just 3.2% and warned the slowdown risks being even more severe. It said fast-rising prices were to blame for much of the slowdown, with households and businesses squeezed by a combination of higher prices and higher borrowing costs as policymakers raise interest rates to try to counter inflation. ""The global economy, still reeling from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook,"" economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog outlining the international lending body's latest economic forecast. ""The outlook has darkened significantly"" since April, the last time the IMF issued forecasts, he added. The global economy contracted in the three months to July, which was the first decline since the pandemic hit, the IMF said. The probability of a recession in the G7 economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK - now stands at roughly 15% - nearly four times higher than usual. While UK growth is expected to remain relatively strong this year, Mr Gourinchas said unusually high inflation - faster than in Europe or the US - is expected to take a toll in 2023. ""If you were to look at both years together, it's actually not very far from where the other advanced economies are,"" he told the BBC. ""The one thing that worries me more about the UK economy is that their inflation numbers seem to be quite high. There is a fairly high pass through from high gas prices to broader prices in the economy.  ""That would signal even further monetary policy tightening by the Bank of England and that would also weigh down on growth going forward."" The IMF now expects inflation to reach 6.6% in advanced economies and 9.5% in emerging market and developing economies - nearly a full percentage point higher than it expected in April. ""Inflation at current levels represents a clear risk for current and future macroeconomic stability and bringing it back to central bank targets should be the top priority for policymakers,"" Mr Gourinchas said. ""Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship."" The fallout from the war in Ukraine is being felt in pockets across the world. Soaring food and fuel prices and higher interest rates means the IMF sees more gloomy prospects for all major economies - but it's the UK that, Russia apart, remains bottom of the pile for 2023.  Brexit may not have helped but it's our reliance on fossil fuels - they make up 75% of our energy mix, more than in the EU  - that's made us particularly vulnerable to this shock. Those prices are determined on international markets but affect us all. This report comes on the day that, with the energy price cap set to top £3,000 in October, a committee of MPs warns that further government help for households may be needed.   But the IMF is among those economists who've noted that the UK faces more fundamental issues than the current crisis, with living standards having dropped behind many competitors over the last 15 years, something many attribute to a lack of investment in skills, equipment and infrastructure. Officials from the IMF have previously told me that one way to remedy that would be to raise, not lower taxes, to fund more investment.  The US saw the steepest downgrade of any country for 2022. The IMF cut its growth forecast for the world's largest economy to 2.3% this year, from 3.7% previously, and to just 1% in 2023. Meanwhile growth in China is expected to fall to 3.3% this year, the slowest rate in nearly four decades, as the country wrestles with new Covid lockdowns and a property crisis. Questions about the reliability of Europe's natural gas supplies from Russia, as well as political unrest generated by high food and fuel prices, are among the risks the global economy is facing in the months ahead, the IMF said. ""We can be reasonably hopeful that China might be rebound,"" Mr Gourinchas said, adding that he was ""much more concerned about both the inflation path and the tightening of monetary policy leading to a slowdown going ahead"". It warned that in a ""plausible"" scenario, in which only some of those risks materialise, like a shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, global economic growth could fall to 2% next year - a pace the world has fallen below just five times since 1970."

But what is it for? When is it? Is it a celebration or a protest? And is there an equivalent International Men's Day?  For more than a century people around the world have been marking 8 March as a special day for women. Read on to find out why. International Women's Day grew out of the labour movement to become a UN-recognised annual event.  The seeds of it were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. It was the Socialist Party of America who declared the first National Woman's Day, a year later. The idea to make the day international came from a woman called Clara Zetkin. She suggested the idea in 1910 at an International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen. There were 100 women there, from 17 countries, and they agreed on her suggestion unanimously.   It was first celebrated in 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The centenary was celebrated in 2011, so this year we're technically celebrating the 108th International Women's Day.  Things were made official in 1975 when the United Nations (UN) started celebrating the day and setting an annual theme. The first one (in 1996) was ""Celebrating the past, Planning for the Future"". This year's focuses on """"Think equal, build smart, innovate for change"" - UN figures show that only half of working age women are represented in the labour force globally. International Women's Day has become a date to celebrate how far women have come in society, in politics and in economics, while the political roots of the day mean strikes and protests are organised to raise awareness of continued inequality.  8 March. Clara's idea for an International Women's Day had no fixed date. It wasn't formalised until a war-time strike in 1917 when Russian women demanded ""bread and peace"" - and four days into the women's strike the Tsar was forced to abdicate and the provisional government granted women the right to vote. The date when the women's strike commenced on the Julian calendar, which was then in use in Russia, was Sunday 23 February. This day in the Gregorian calendar was 8 March - and that's when it's celebrated today. There is indeed, on 19 November. But it has only been marked since the 1990s and isn't recognised by the UN. People celebrate it in more than 60 countries, including the UK. The objectives of the day are ""to focus attention on men's and boys' health, improve gender relations, promote gender equality and highlight positive male role models"". The theme for 2018 was ""Positive Male Role Models"".  International Women's Day is a national holiday in many countries, including Russia where the sales of flowers doubles during the three or four days around 8 March.  In China, many women are given a half-day off work on 8 March, as advised by the State Council, although many employers don't always pass the half day on to their female employees.  In Italy, International Women's Day, or la Festa della Donna, is celebrated by the giving of mimosa blossom. The origin of this tradition is unclear but it is believed to have started in Rome after World War II.  In the US, the month of March is Women's History Month. A presidential proclamation issued every year honours the achievements of American women. This year's International Women's Day campaign has chosen the theme #BalanceforBetter, which encourages people around the world to take action towards accelerating gender balance. The past 18 months have seen the women's movement reach an unprecedented scale. In October 2017, millions began using the hashtag #MeToo on social media to speak out against experiences of harassment and sexual assault, and to denounce their widespread prevalence.  In 2018, the #MeToo conversation grew to a global scale, with countries such as India, France, China, and South Korea joining in the conversation to demand change. In the US a record number of women were elected in the midterm elections. In Ireland, citizens voted to repeal the eighth amendment of the constitution, paving the way for legalised abortion.

He said the area ""may be the underdogs that people frequently underestimate"".  But ""we've consistently proven them wrong"" by securing events such as BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend and the Rugby League World Cup, he added. Criteria required to host Eurovision include being within easy reach of an international airport and having a venue which can accommodate about 10,000 spectators. Having enough hotel accommodation for at least 2,000 delegates, journalists and spectators is also necessary. The winning country normally hosts the following year - but organisers ruled staging the event in Ukraine would be unsafe while the war continued. The UK was chosen after Sam Ryder came second in this year's contest. Mr Houchen revealed the authority's bid during discussions at a council scrutiny meeting on Wednesday, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Darlington Council Conservative leader Jonathan Dulston said the town was ""perfectly suited"" to host the event. ""I am well aware that it is an outside shot - I think we have a very strong case,"" he said. Authority officials said the bid would be supported by a programme to ""respect and celebrate"" Ukraine and its people.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65237286","Interest rates likely to fall to pre-Covid levels, IMF predicts",2023-04-11,"Dearbail Jordan","Business reporter, BBC News","Interest rates in major economies are expected to fall in the future because of low productivity and ageing populations, according to a forecast. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says increases in borrowing costs are likely to be ""temporary"" once high inflation is brought under control. The Bank of England has been raising interest rates since December 2021, taking them from 0.1% to 4.25%. This has raised mortgage payments for many homeowners. Central banks in the UK, the US, Europe and other nations have been lifting interest rates to combat the rate of price rises, otherwise known as inflation.  In the UK, inflation is at its highest for nearly 40 years because of rising energy prices and soaring food costs. A number of factors are fuelling inflation, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine which has helped drive up energy costs. However, in a blog the IMF said that ""recent increases in real interest rates are likely to be temporary"". It added: ""When inflation is brought back under control, advanced economies' central banks are likely to ease monetary policy and bring real interest rates back towards pre-pandemic levels."" Real interest rates take into account inflation. The IMF did not say, however, exactly when interest rates were set to fall back to lower levels. This observation from the IMF about falling interest rates is not going to offer much immediate relief to hard-pressed mortgage holders. There is a fairly large caveat in the analysis that it applies after the current period of high inflation is over, and then only if governments keep their debts in order. The report says ""post pandemic increases in interest rates could be protracted until inflation is brought back to target"". However over the coming years and decades it is making the point that what we consider as the ""normal"" level of interest rate has fallen in advanced economies including the UK. After adjusting for inflation, the implication is that a more normal real rate is close to zero. So assuming inflation settles back at its target level of 2%, that is consistent with Bank of England base rates around 2-3%, rather than above 4% as now. There are many long term factors influencing these trends, from ageing, to migration, to tax and spend policy, and growth in the economy. But it points to a world, after the shocks of the past three years, where there is a new normal for interest rates. Eventually. The Washington-based financial institution said ageing populations would be one factor likely to lower inflation. Explaining why older people affect inflation, George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said that they tend to spend less. ""The amount that you spend relative to your income is highest when you're in your 20s, 30s and 40s - often that's maybe young families, when you've got households forming, you've got couples coming together, they tend to spend the most when they decorate and buy a car or whatever, and you as you get older in life you slow down your consumption,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""There's less heading to Glastonbury and nights out on the town, there's more sitting at home and watching the Antiques Roadshow, so therefore your spending patterns sort of reduce and you save more and so an ageing population tends to be disinflationary.""  Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said recently that in the UK, the share of adults aged between 20 and 59 years-old has fallen to below 65% in the past decade ""and it is set to decline further in the coming years"". He said that this has been driven by a decline in birth rates as well as people living for longer. The IMF also said low productivity - the measure of how many goods and services are produced - would bring inflation down.  In a speech last month, Mr Bailey said that prior to the financial crisis in 2008, UK productivity had been boosted by the country's manufacturing sector.  ""But following the financial crisis, manufacturing productivity growth fell back sharply. This fall in manufacturing productivity is the main cause of the slowdown,"" he said. Just prior to the Covid pandemic, the UK's interest rate was 0.75% but the Bank of England cut it twice in March 2020 to 0.1% as the country entered lockdown. The rate of inflation has risen steadily over the past couple of years and hit 10.4% in February - more than five times higher than the Bank of England's 2% target. Following the decision to raise UK interest rates again in March, the Bank of England said that it expected inflation ""to fall sharply over the rest of the year"".  This is due to the government's continuing help with household heating bills through the Energy Price Guarantee scheme as well as falling wholesale gas prices.  However, Mr Bailey declined to say whether he believed that interest rates had reached a peak."

Yulia Peresild, 36, and Klim Shipenko, 37, will blast off in a Russian rocket from Baikonur cosmodrome on 5 October.   The drama has the working title Challenge. Russia's Roscosmos space agency says it wants to show space opening up for a wider range of people. Nasa and actor Tom Cruise also plan to make a film aboard the space station. It is not yet clear when their Hollywood space movie, announced last year, will be shot. Cruise is expected to go to the ISS with director Doug Liman. Nasa says Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company will also be involved. The Roscosmos announcement on Thursday has triggered speculation that Russia is now in a new kind of celebrity space race with the US. Roscosmos says Peresild and Shipenko have undergone both a medical and a creative selection process. Their special space flight training is to begin no later than 1 June, and will include centrifuge and vibration tests, flights on a zero-gravity plane and parachute training. Russia's RIA news agency reports that the movie will tell the story of a female surgeon's mission to perform an operation on a cosmonaut too ill to return to Earth immediately. There were thousands of applicants and Peresild beat 19 female rivals for the starring role.  The whole project will be covered by Russian state TV Channel One. The co-producers of the movie will be Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin and Channel One director Konstantin Ernst. Peresild has starred in several big Russian dramas, including The Edge and Battle For Sevastopol, and she is an Honoured Artist of the Russian Federation. Shipenko directed Serf, a 2019 comedy that earned more than $42m (£29.9m) at the box office, and an award-winning disaster movie set in space - Salyut 7. He is also an actor and playwright. Roscosmos has also announced that Japanese online fashion tycoon Yusaku Maezawa, 45, will go on a 12-day trip to the ISS in December.  The billionaire founder of clothing business Zozo Ltd is also a well-known collector of modern art. He will be accompanied by Japanese cameraman Yozo Hirano and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin.  Russia last sent a space tourist to the ISS in 2009. Mr Maezawa will be the first one from Japan. The ISS is the largest orbiting laboratory ever built. The first stage was launched in November 1998 by Roscosmos. Since then, the US, the European, Japanese and Canadian space agencies have contributed more modules, robotic arms and giant solar arrays.  Its primary purpose is to develop the capability to live and work in space. The experience gained there should pave the way for more complex structures in space, such as a permanent base on the Moon and missions to Mars. The ISS was built to carry out scientific experiments. It is doing pioneering work on plants and materials in microgravity, BBC Science correspondent Pallab Ghosh says. The astronauts are guided in those experiments by researchers on Earth.  They also study the effects of prolonged weightlessness on themselves."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58013284","Boeing delays rerun of Starliner space capsule test",2021-08-04,"Jonathan Amos","BBC Science Correspondent•@BBCAmos","Boeing says it is checking the propulsion system valves on its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, after Tuesday's planned launch was postponed.  The CST-100 Starliner will launch from Florida at some point to showcase how it can ferry crews to and from the International Space Station (ISS). It will be the second test flight, and conducted with no people aboard. The previous demonstration in 2019 encountered software problems that very nearly caused the loss of the capsule. The Starliner will ride to orbit on an Atlas-5 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Controllers had been targeting Tuesday for the launch but scrubbed the countdown with two-and-a-half hours left on the clock, to allow for investigation of technical issues related to the capsule's propulsion system. Now Boeing says a rescheduled launch on Wednesday will not happen either, because it needs more time to discover the reason for ""unexpected valve position indications in the propulsion system"". It's just over 10 years since Boeing first presented its design for the CST-100 Starliner at the Farnborough Air Show in the UK. It was a response to the call for commercial companies to take over the responsibility for low-Earth orbit crew transportation, post the soon-to-retire space shuttles. The US space agency (Nasa) gave technical and financial support to both Boeing and the SpaceX company, to help them develop new capsules. The idea was that the vehicles would then be engaged on a commercial basis whenever Nasa needed astronauts sent up to the ISS. But while SpaceX is now two crewed operational flights into this privatised era, Boeing has yet to run a single crewed mission in a Starliner. And that's because Boeing's first unpiloted ""Orbital Flight Test"" in December 2019 went seriously awry. The problems started with a clock error on the capsule just after launch that made the vehicle think it was in a different flight phase than was really the case. This prompted the onboard computer system to over-fire Starliner's thrusters and burn so much fuel it became impossible to reach the intended destination of a docking with the space station. Controllers on the ground could see the problem playing out but had difficulty communicating with the spacecraft. After the truncated mission, it also emerged that poorly designed software could have resulted in the capsule colliding with its aft service section when the two were commanded to separate just prior to re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Fortunately, this issue was caught and prevented, and the capsule landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The post-mission review initiated a series of re-designs and upgrades that have enabled Boeing to attempt an Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2). Chris Ferguson, a former Nasa astronaut and Boeing's director of Starliner mission operations, said the company had run full-mission duration simulations of the new software on the capsule.  The new code, he added, had implemented every correction recommended by the review. ""We fixed every one, we addressed every one. We want this next flight to be as clean as it could possibly be,"" he told reporters. ""We have thoroughly dug into, tested and verified hundreds of times the software code, to ensure that it performs exactly the way we intend on OFT-2."" The re-run will follow the same profile: an uncrewed mission to the ISS. That said, an anthropomorphic test device, more commonly known as a flight dummy, dubbed ""Rosie the Rocketeer"", will once again strap in for the ride. Rosie and ""her"" capsule will stay attached to the station for five days, before departing for a parachute-assisted descent and landing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. If Boeing can put the flaws of OFT-1 behind it, Nasa could clear Starliner to start carrying people before the end of the year. This would finally give the agency the two new crew-transportation systems it sought when the shuttles were retired to museums exactly 10 years ago.  ""This is a huge component to returning this launch capability from the United States and having redundancy between SpaceX and Boeing, so that we're not reliant on just one company to get astronauts to the International Space Station,"" said Nicole Mann, a Nasa astronaut who has been selected to fly on the first crewed Starliner mission. And this capability would also open up space to wider participation, she believed: ""You're going to see more folks in low-Earth orbit who are not Nasa astronauts. That's great. I think for the younger generation, they're going to see scientists, engineers and maybe journalists in space, and they're going to be able to capture the amazement of space and share the experience."""

Health officials and Hertfordshire County Council have developed a winter health guide, which will be delivered to all homes in the county. It advises people to get the Covid-19 vaccination and a booster jab if they qualify; to wear masks in crowded or enclosed places such as public transport; to take regular lateral flow tests before meeting people; and to continue to regularly wash and sanitise hands.  Mr McManus said the virus was still spreading ""very happily"", aided by the rise of the Delta variant. ""Don't take it as a slavish rule, but if you work from home at least part of the week - so you reduce your social interaction - that really does help cut infection,"" he said. ""It will reduce something like, for the average person, 60 to 70 in-person contacts a week. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65889058","Amnesty: Possible war crimes in recent Israel-Gaza fighting",2023-06-13,"David Gritten","BBC News","War crimes were possibly committed during last month's fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, Amnesty International says. A report by the human rights group concludes that Israeli forces conducted apparently disproportionate air strikes which killed Palestinian civilians. It also says indiscriminate Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) rocket fire killed both Israeli and Palestinian civilians. Amnesty is calling on the International Criminal Court to investigate. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it operated in accordance with its obligations under international law and made efforts to minimize harm to civilians that were not required by law. A spokesman for PIJ said the group welcomed Amnesty's report.  Thirty-four Palestinians and one Israeli were killed in the latest round of cross-border fighting, which erupted on 9 May and ended five days later with an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire. It began when Israeli warplanes carried out overnight air strikes that killed three senior commanders of PIJ's military wing in their homes as well as 10 civilians, including relatives and neighbours of the men. Amnesty International said the dropping of precision-guided bombs on densely-populated areas when families were sleeping suggested ""that those who planned and authorised the attacks anticipated - and likely disregarded - the disproportionate harm to civilians"".""Intentionally launching disproportionate attacks... is a war crime,"" it warned. The IDF said that during the fighting which followed, its aircraft struck more than 400 military targets belonging to PIJ and killed three other senior commanders of its military wing, which it blamed for the firing of dozens of rockets and mortars at Israel the previous week. Amnesty investigated nine strikes, including those that targeted the three PIJ commanders in their homes. The IDF said it ""made numerous efforts to minimise harm to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip, including by delaying and even cancelling planned attacks when unexpected presence of civilians was identified"". ""The IDF carried out attacks only after a real-time assessment before the attack that the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property will not be excessive in relation to the military advantage anticipated in the attack, according to the information it had in the circumstances,"" it added.  Amnesty also said it ""identified a pattern of extensive destruction of property"" in Gaza as a result of the Israeli strikes that ""failed to meet the exceptions under which attacking homes and other civilian objects would be justified"". It cited the targeting on 13 May of a four-storey building in the Jabaliya refugee camp that was home to 42 people from the extended Nabhan family. Amnesty found no evidence that the building had been used to store weapons or any other military equipment, or that rockets had been launched nearby. ""In our investigation, we heard vivid accounts of bombs obliterating homes, of fathers digging their little girls out from under rubble, of a teenager fatally injured as she lay in bed holding a teddy bear,"" said Amnesty's Middle East director Heba Morayef.  ""More frightening than any of this is the near certainty that, unless perpetrators are held to account, these horrifying scenes will be repeated."" The IDF said: ""Islamic Jihad locates its operational centres in civilian residential buildings and uses the civilian population as a human shield. ""Several hours prior to strikes, the IDF ensured that the buildings were evacuated from civilians by various means, such as telephone calls and the 'roof-knocking' procedure. These buildings were not attacked until they were fully evacuated of civilian population."" PIJ responded to the Israeli strikes by firing more than 1,400 rockets towards Israel, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to take cover in bomb shelters.  The IDF says 1,139 crossed into Israeli territory in total and that about 430 headed for populated areas were intercepted by its missile defence systems. An Israeli woman and a Palestinian labourer from Gaza were killed by rockets that hit an apartment in Rehovot and a building site in Shokeda respectively.  Amnesty says rockets that fell short in Gaza also appear to have killed three Palestinian civilians, including two children.  The report cites relatives of the children as saying they died when a rocket hit al-Sahaba street in Gaza City on the afternoon of 10 May.  PIJ denied at the time that a rocket hit the area and blamed Israeli strikes, but witnesses told a researcher that individuals associated with the group removed remnants of a rocket in the immediate aftermath of the incident. ""Known for their inherent inaccuracy, rocket attacks by Palestinian armed groups are indiscriminate; these attacks must be investigated as war crimes and victims be granted prompt and adequate redress,"" Ms Morayef said.   PIJ spokesman Tariq Salmi did not comment on that allegation. But he told the BBC that Amnesty's report ""proves that the occupation [Israel] was the one that began the aggression by committing grave crimes"". ""The enemy uses the weapons it has to kill Palestinian civilians and we are doing our part to defend ourselves against the crimes committed by Israel against the Palestinian people,"" he added."

Flights from Schiphol to Belfast were cancelled on Friday, Sunday and Monday. Passengers said they were not notified until the last minute and have had no information or help from EasyJet. The airline has apologised and said flights had been impacted by ""strong winds, combined with runway maintenance"". ""It has been a total nightmare,"" Danielle Hamilton from Belfast told BBC News NI. ""We just do not know what is happening, our stress levels have been through the roof"". Danielle travelled for a break in the Dutch capital with her partner Jonathon and brother Jordan, who has cystic fibrosis.  They had been due to return home on Friday.  ""When we got to the airport it was bedlam,"" she said.  The flight was due to leave at 17:35, there was no information, nothing on the board, then at 19:00 it appeared that the flight had been cancelled. ""But there was no-one from EasyJet at the airport to help, staff were telling us to ring them or go on their app"". After an hour-long phone call, they were told the first flight they could come home on would be 27 April. But with her brother's medication running out they had to try and get him home as soon as possible. ""We were able to get him on an EasyJet flight set to leave Amsterdam on Monday,"" she said. ""But he got to the airport only to find out that flight was cancelled too.  ""We have had to pay to get him home on another airline, he has been our priority, getting him home was the most important thing"". Jordan was due to arrive home on Monday evening. ""I did manage to speak to an EasyJet staff member, and she was asking how Jordan was. What she told us was the flights are being cancelled because of air traffic control and the wind,"" Danielle said. She said she and her partner are now ""stranded in a hotel room"" on the outskirts of the city reliant on the generosity of relatives. Seventeen-year-old Caitlin Lowry, from Bangor, travelled to Amsterdam last week along with her aunt Natasha and grandmother Margaret. What should have been a lovely family getaway, has become an ""horrific experience,"" she said. ""We were due to fly back on Sunday and were half way through security when an email arrived to say there was no flight. But there was no one from EasyJet there, no one to talk to. We just sat down and had to think what we were going to do,"" Caitlin said. It was extremely difficult to get in touch with the airline, she explained. Her parents in Northern Ireland were able to do so before she was, and the family was booked to fly home on Monday. ""Now that's been cancelled too,"" Caitlin said.  ""We got an email from the airport, not EasyJet to let us know"". Having spent two nights in a hotel at their own expense, they have booked to fly home with an alternative airline on Tuesday. ""It has just been horrific, we are all just exhausted and want to get home. ""Anything we have got, hotels etc, we have had to pay for ourselves. It's been hard for all of us, my grandmother and aunt both have health problems,"" she said. An EasyJet spokeswoman confirmed flights between Amsterdam and Belfast had been impacted due to ""ongoing operating restrictions at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport as a result of strong winds, combined with runway maintenance"". She said the weather conditions and runway maintenance had meant the airport was unable to accommodate all planned flights. ""While this was outside of our control we would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience, particularly to those passengers who were also affected over the weekend by cancellations on the same route due to the airport restrictions put in place,"" the spokeswoman added. The airline is doing ""all possible"" for impacted passengers including providing hotel accommodation, meals and the option to transfer to an alternative flight free of charge, she explained. ""We advised passengers that anyone who sourced their own hotel accommodation will be reimbursed for any expenses."" Flights scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday are scheduled to operate as planned, the airline said."

Energy firm SSE intends to create the site, on the south side of the runway, at Teesside Airport. It is the latest project to be revealed as part of plans to repurpose land for industrial use. Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said it will generate power for the airport, helping it to become ""net zero"". The plans, which are due to be submitted to Darlington Borough Council, suggest the solar farm will be built in phases, starting with a 3MW facility next year. Further phases would then be constructed on the land, which Mr Houchen said, could deliver 50MWs and make it one of the largest projects of its kind in the UK. ""Indeed, it likely means the airport will be the first in the country to be carbon neutral,"" he said. ""Our work with SSE Energy Solutions again proves how we can attract the biggest and best companies to our region to work on innovative schemes, which provide well-paid, highly skilled jobs and serious investment while also delivering a greener future."" The energy firm, based in Perth, Scotland, has also signed a lease to open a base, designed to help manage the infrastructure. SSE Energy Solutions managing director Neil Kirkby said it would create ""great opportunities"" for local people. He said: ""We are building a strong presence within Teesside through the creation of a regional 'hub', the like of which we're also establishing in many other regions across the UK.""

The airline will operate flights to Budapest, Cardiff, Mallorca and Valencia next year. But it claimed that if Air Passenger Duty (APD) were to be scrapped, the airline would look to add extra routes to and from Belfast. It comes after Ryanair announced in July it would return to the airport with 12 new routes. Across the 16 routes the airline will operate more than 140 weekly flights to and from Belfast International Airport, with two airport-based aircraft and more than 800 jobs.  It represents an investment of £164m.  The managing director of Belfast International Airport, Graham Keddie, said the announce was a ""fantastic"" way to end the year. ""These exciting new destinations, particularly Budapest and Cardiff, which are both previously unserved, are most welcome and will provide further connectivity from Northern Ireland,"" he said. Last year, Ryanair pulled out of both Belfast International and Belfast City airports, citing the operating costs of airports, and the government's ""refusal to suspend or reduce"" Air Passenger Duty. APD is a tax levied on air passengers, which varies according to destination and class of travel. Airports and airlines have lobbied for it to abolished on short haul flights from Northern Ireland. Ryanair's director of digital and marketing, Dara Brady, said a 50% cut on domestic flights from next April is not enough. He said: ""To encourage additional investment from all airlines from next summer onward, the UK government must immediately scrap ADP taxes for all flights, which currently put the UK at risk of losing air traffic to competing European countries.  ""We've said lower access cost is the route to gaining more passenger numbers for airports."" Meanwhile, Ryanair has agreed a new four-year pay deal with its Irish pilots which will see their salary levels restored to pre-Covid levels immediately. The airline had imposed pay cuts on its pilots earlier in the pandemic as all but essential travel was banned. The pay agreement also includes three years of pay increases and will be in force until March 2027. Ryanair's people director, Darrell Hughes, said: ""We welcome this pay restoration agreement with Forsa [the pilots' union] and our Irish pilots which will see pay cuts previously agreed during Covid restored in the December payroll, in time for Christmas."""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53216390","Coronavirus in Singapore: Election campaigning without the handshakes",2020-07-05,"Yvette Tan","BBC News","For some politicians, campaigning season is one of the few times they have to get up close and personal with the public, as they try to persuade people to vote them into office.  But the global pandemic has turned everything on its head, national elections included.  Political rallies held online, socially distanced door-knocking sessions, and fist bumps instead of handshakes would have been unthinkable a few months ago, yet this is what politicians in Singapore are having to contend with as the country gears up for its general election on 10 July. The election next Friday takes place as Singapore records more than 44,000 cases of the coronavirus, most of which stem from outbreaks in dormitories housing migrant manual labourers. A partial lockdown was eased earlier this month, but social distancing rules are still in place - people are called to stay at least 1m apart and mass gatherings have been banned.  So how do you campaign amid a pandemic? Rallies are the lifeblood of election campaigns - they're one of the main ways candidates are able to get their message out to the masses. The Progress Singapore Party (PSP), which was founded last year, is among 12 opposition parties hoping to make gains this year. It's a tall order to take on the People's Action Party (PAP), which has ruled Singapore since independence in 1965. One PSP member said the decision not to hold physical rallies this year would greatly hurt its chances, and said calling an election in the midst of a pandemic was ""being done at risk to people"".  ""The opposition rallies were always a very strong selling point. They are very well attended and there's lots of atmosphere that gets generated in it,"" Lee Hsien Yang told the BBC during a walkabout.  ""To run this election and to forbid any rallies to be held, disadvantages the opposition,"" said Mr Lee, who happens to be the brother of Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's prime minister and head of the PAP. In 2015, one opposition rally drew an estimated crowd of 30,000 - a sizeable number in the country of five million. An MP from the PAP, however, said the fact that the election was so heavily reliant on online platforms and social media would actually help to balance things out. ""[As the incumbent] we've been walking the ground all these years, a lot of our networks are actually through our face-to-face engagement,"" Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat, who is running as a candidate in the upcoming elections, told the BBC.  ""[Taking away these physical opportunities] and using social media, I think actually gives the opposition more opportunities to reach voters, so it does level the playing-field on this front."" But politics aside, there are a whole other range of difficulties that the lack of physical rallies brings.  ""In a physical rally, someone travels from his house to a venue, and once he gets there he typically devotes around an hour of time to listen to what you have to say,"" said Mr Tan, a PSP member who has been involved in setting up the group's online presence.  ""In a physical rally you can plan your speech - you know what your intro will be, your middle and how to end. But in a virtual rally, you're more likely to have 15 seconds to capture someone's interest,"" he told the BBC. And even if you do capture their initial interest - you've got to be able to maintain it.  ""You probably have five parties doing an online rally at around the same time - it's like channel surfing. So the challenge is how to engage and connect with the audience,"" Mr Tan said.  Another hurdle is getting through to groups who might not be used to going online - elderly people who may be less tech-savvy, for example.  ""You can produce all the content you want but the difficulty is getting it to reach the correct people. If you're not a politically-inclined person these ads may not pop up on your Facebook,"" said Mr Tan. The group's plan to combat this is to print out flyers directing people to their online presence. ""We distribute flyers directing people to our Facebook page and our meet-up sessions via Zoom,"" said Mr Tan.  ""We did a survey later and found about 60% of people found out about our Zoom session through the flyer. So [it's a] hybrid - mixing the traditional with the modern methods is the way to go."" But that doesn't mean the traditional methods have faded away completely.  Candidates are still walking the ground and knocking on doors, but are having to do so in smaller groups - and at a distance.  ""[On door-knocking visits] we observe social distancing, our team is not more than five people, and we want to keep the interactions with residents quite brief, so we don't have prolonged contact,"" said PAP candidate Mr Chee. ""[We are still carrying our visits because] online is not a perfect substitute for face-to-face interactions, especially for many of our seniors who may not be familiar with IT."" It's certainly not perfect - but candidates running have little choice but to make the best of their circumstances. ""As a voter, your contact point the candidate is now limited to [a few] seconds. Not being able to shake hands, that's not a big issue, [but rather] the lack of visual recognition,"" said Mr Tan. ""[When you see someone in a mask] you might not have visual recognition, or you can't remember exactly which candidate it was.

The Covid-19 pandemic has influenced the lives of billions of people around the world. In Jakobsen's case, it led to a change of career. ""I have always wanted to be a footballer but doctors advised me to stop at the age of 17 because I had to undergo an operation on my hip,"" says Jakobsen, now 23. ""They said playing handball would be better for my health. That was extremely disappointing at the time."" Jakobsen was considered one of the best footballers in his age group as a youngster, and even made his First Division debut for HB Torshavn as a 16-year-old in 2013. He used to play in midfield, and Steven Gerrard was one of his favourite footballers, which was a natural choice for a Liverpool fan. ""I aspired to have a professional career abroad as a footballer but had to abandon that dream and switch to handball,"" Jakobsen remembers. He turned out to be very good in the other sport as well. ""I joined H71, who are the best club in the Faroe Islands, represented the under-20 national team, and was later called into the senior national team,"" Jakobsen says. Left-footed on the football pitch, he is right-handed on the handball court. ""I started playing on the left wing and then was converted into a left-back,"" he says. Whatever the position, the results were magnificent: ""I won three championship titles and two national cups with H71. I was fully focused on handball and didn't dare to think of football again."" In January, Jakobsen took part in the World Cup qualifiers, but then the pandemic struck and handball activities were stopped.  ""In those circumstances, I decided to play football a bit with the reserve team of HB, in order to stay fit. I scored twice on my debut and then suddenly the head coach got in touch with me,"" Jakobsen recalls. Jens Berthel Askou, the former Norwich City defender who is now in charge of HB, wanted Jakobsen to join the senior squad. ""Initially, I refused because it seemed like a bad idea, but then I thought about it for a while and changed my mind,"" Jakobsen says. That was the decision that changed his life completely. The Faroe Islands Premier League was well under way at the time, yet Jakobsen was immediately thrown into the starting line-up as a centre-forward. ""I never played in that position before as a youngster but the coach thought I should be used in the penalty area,"" he says.  Askou was right. Jakobsen scored in three consecutive matches in July and was even more prolific in the autumn, finding the net in five games in a row. He contributed 12 goals and five assists in just 17 fixtures, helping the team to win the title comfortably. In 2019, he won the double in handball with H71. In 2020, he was a champion in football too. Last Saturday, the team celebrated the triumph after a 1-1 draw at KI, when Jakobsen received some breathtaking news. ""The coach entered the dressing room, asked everyone to be quiet and announced that I had been called up for the national team. That was quite amazing. My team-mates were jubilant and poured a bottle of champagne on my head,"" Jakobsen says. In January, he faced Lithuania as a handball player. On Wednesday, he played against the same nation, but in a different sport. The coach, Hakan Ericsson, used Jakobsen for the full 90 minutes, signalling that he could be the Faroe Islands' new target man. ""This is definitely the best year of my life,"" he says. ""Suddenly, I am a footballer again, winning titles and representing my country in my favourite sport. Liverpool won the title in England too, which makes it even better. I wasn't born when they did it in 1990. ""From now on, I am fully dedicated to football. My handball team-mates might have been a bit sad to see me go, but they fully support me and understand. ""As for my new team-mates at HB, I have known some of them from the youth teams. They can't stop laughing when they think of what happened to me this year. ""Now, the target is to play abroad. That's what I wanted as a kid and I can think about it again. Maybe I would be able to move to Denmark, Sweden or Norway, and go to an even bigger league from there. ""Who knows? Life is full of surprises."" Life After Reality TV: Love Island and Basketball star Ovie Soko The Rap Game UK: The artists face their first challenge"

""Mission control teams corrected the action and all systems are operating normally,"" US space agency Nasa said. This was done by activating thrusters on other modules of the ISS. An investigation is now under way. US and Russian officials stressed that the seven crew members aboard the space station were never in any danger. The malfunction happened three hours after the Nauka module docked with the ISS on Thursday, following an eight-day flight from Earth. Nasa officials said Nauka's jets started firing uncommanded at 12:34 EDT (16:45 GMT) ""moving the station 45 degrees out of attitude"". The Russian Zvezda segment and a Progress freighter then responded to push the station back into its correct pointing configuration. The incident was over by 13:29 EDT. ""What we saw today was just an awesome job by the mission control flight teams,"" said Joel Montalbano, Nasa's ISS programme manager. ""Those guys were rock stars again and got us back in attitude control. That also shows you what a robust vehicle we have, and our ability to take these contingencies, recover from them and move on,"" he told reporters. Communications with the ISS crew were lost for two periods, of four minutes and seven minutes, during the incident. However, the US agency said that the astronauts were safe. They ""really didn't feel any movement"", it added. The mishap forced Nasa and Boeing to push back Friday's uncrewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule, a vehicle intended to carry astronauts in the future. ""We wanted to give the ISS programme time to assess what had happened today, to determine the cause and make sure that they were really ready to support the Starliner launch,"" explained Steve Stich, the manager of Nasa's commercial crew programme. ""Right now the earliest opportunity would be Tuesday, 3 August, which would be a 13:20 EDT (17:20 GMT) launch.  The 13m-long, 20-tonne Nauka was earlier attached to the rear of the orbiting platform, linking up with the other major Russian segments on the station. The module should have launched in 2007, but the vessel suffered repeated slips in schedule, in part because of budget difficulties but also because engineers encountered a raft of technical problems during development. Even after it launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan a week ago, it experienced propulsion issues that required workarounds from controllers in Moscow. In the end, however, it docked with the station on the planned date.  The new module will result in a significant boost in habitable volume for the ISS, raising it by 70 cubic metres. Cosmonauts will use the extra space to conduct experiments and to store cargo. They'll also use it as a rest area, and it has another toilet for crew to use on the station.  In addition, the module carries with it a large robotic arm (ERA) supplied by the European Space Agency (Esa). This 11m-long device will be able to operate all around the Russian end of the ISS. With the aid of an ""elbow"" joint, it will shift position by moving hand over hand. Nauka's installation comes just as Russia has been questioning its future role in the ISS project. Moscow officials recently warned about the more-than-20-year age of some of their on-orbit hardware and intimated the country could pull out of the station in 2025. And Russia has shown little interest in joining the US-led lunar platform, known as the Gateway, which will be assembled later this decade."

Dudley councillor Colin Elcock tweeted Islam was ""domination not integration"" and asked whether people in Iran were ""all on the dole"". Initially suspended from the Conservative party, he has since been expelled, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. The council has directed him to undergo equality and diversity training.  Mr Elcock, who represents the Norton ward, admitted sending the since-deleted tweets. However, he denied posting a pornographic image, which also drew complaints, saying his account had been hacked. The council committee failed to agree on whether he was responsible for the ""lewd"" image, but said the tweets about Iran and Islam had breached its code of conduct. It also censured him for abusive messages targeting politicians including Michael Heseltine, Hilary Benn, John Bercow and Jeremy Corbyn, as well as journalists Emily Maitlis, Louise Minchin, Kirsty Wark and Robert Peston. Much of Mr Elcock's mitigation relied on ""the country being in uproar"" at the time and ""BBC correspondents inciting aggravation"", BBC Radio WM's political reporter, Rob Mayor, said. Mr Elcock also said the fallout from the tweets had ""destroyed his family"" and that his wife of 50 years was seeking a divorce. ""This is the most horrendous situation I have ever brought on my family and I just want it cleared,"" he said.

The taxi booking office he manages near Mecca's iconic Grand Mosque, the Masjid al-Haram, is empty. ""There's no work, no salary, nothing,"" he says. ""Usually these two or three months before the Hajj (annual pilgrimage) me and the drivers make enough money to last for the rest of the year. But now nothing."" One of his drivers, Samiur Rahman, part of Saudi Arabia's largely foreign private workers, sends the office status updates from the roads around the popular Mecca clock tower. The sea of pilgrims is missing - they usually line the streets, dressed in white, with umbrellas to protect themselves from the intense heat. Today the drivers' people-carriers are void of passengers and the city looks like a ghost town. Sajjad's drivers send him videos of the pigeons filling the roads instead.   ""My drivers have no food and now they are sleeping four or five per room, in rooms designed for two,"" says Sajjad,  I ask him if he is receiving any government help. ""No, no help, nothing. I have savings, which we are spending. But I have a lot of staff - more than 50 people were working with me - and they are suffering.  ""One of my friends called me yesterday, saying, 'Please I need some work, I don't even care how much you want to pay me.' Believe me, the people are crying.""  There are severe restrictions in place for this year's Hajj. Saudi Arabia has seen one of the biggest outbreaks of coronavirus in the Middle East and has said the two million pilgrims who normally come from around the world to Mecca will not be allowed to do so, in a bid to limit the spread of Covid-19.  Only those already living in the country will be allowed to perform the Hajj - taking the number down to just 10,000.  Pilgrims will not be able to freely drink from the holy Well of Zamzam, the water will all have to be bottled individually. And when it comes to the stoning of the three pillars in Mina, symbolising the rejection of the devil, the pebbles will have to be sterilised. Away from Saudi Arabia itself, the huge influx of hungry pilgrims usually leads to lucrative import orders for livestock from neighbouring countries like Kenya - many of whose farmers now have herds of unsold cattle.  ""The livestock subsector in Kenya is big. It's the mainstay for most of the households in the country, and a way of life for most farmers, especially during the Hajj period,"" says Patrick Kimani from the Kenya Livestock Producers Association.  On average, his members export 5,000 head of cattle to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, he says. ""Farmers are now diversifying in to cold storage and local markets. ""We are concerned that it could decimate local cattle prices because all that extra produce could be dumped at cut price to local buyers for a quick sell.""  Hajj dates back to the life of the Prophet Muhammad 1,400 years ago and there have been few limitations like this in its history.  Making the pilgrimage at least once is one of the Five Pillars of Islam - the five obligations that every Muslim, who is in good health and can afford it, must satisfy in order to live a good and responsible life, according to Islam. Pilgrims gather in Mecca to stand before the structure known as the Kaaba, praising Allah (God) together. They perform other acts of worship too, renewing their sense of purpose in the world. The shock of a sudden withdrawal of an age-old source of income is also leaving many tour companies struggling.  Last year, Pakistan sent the most foreign pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. But today in Karachi, Shahzad Tajj says his firm, Cheap Hajj and Umrah Deals, is on the brink of collapse. ""Basically, business is zero. Even other travel-related activities weren't going on. Like flights, logistics, deliveries - so there was nothing to sell. We were not, frankly, totally prepared for this.  ""We had to downsize our staff to minimal numbers. Time has now forced us to sell our assets, cars and some property, to just get through this stage at least. I help out some of my team with emergency funds, but that's all I can offer for now.""  Restrictions this year are putting a large financial hole in the cities of Mecca and Medina, which receive billions of dollars worth of business from the travelling pilgrims.  ""Although most of the cost to the Saudi government of hosting the Hajj will be saved this year, Mecca and Medina will lose out on around the $9bn-$12bn (£7bn-£9bn) worth of business,"" says Mazen Al Sudairi, head of research at the financial services firm Al-Rajhi Capital in Riyadh. Mr Al-Sudairi says the government has stepped in to help. ""Maybe the small and medium enterprises were suffering, but the Saudi central bank is trying to support this segment, to give them relief, by deferring their loans for a further two or three months. ""We believe that we are facing a recovery period - we think the worst is behind us.""  More than 80% of Saudi Arabia's national income comes from oil but prices have plummeted, forcing the country to diversify. Yet things haven't been going so well, according to Alexander Perjessy of Moody's Sovereign Risk Group. ""The government announced in March 2020 it would postpone collection of various government fees, as well as Value Added Tax, for three months. [But] this is not going to avert a recession in the non-oil sector of the economy - we think it will contract by about 4%,"" he says. In Mecca, despite the empty bookings screen in front of him, Sajjad Malik does not want to return to his native Pakistan.  Saudi Arabia has served as an economic last-chance saloon for those in neighbouring countries who were struggling to earn enough.  ""Working in Saudi for over eight years has allowed me to provide for my children and family back home. We get free medical benefits, and when the Hajj does happen, there are great earnings,"" he says. ""The labouring community are struggling now. But this country is still number one for me, praise be to God."""
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49948381",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Three-and-a-half years ago, Lyndon Dykes was working eight hours a day in a factory pressing badges and numbers onto sports kits back in his native Australia. A talented young footballer with a less than professional attitude, he took a risk by moving to Scotland to try to make a living from the sport which was not even his favourite as a boy. Now a key cog in a Livingston side that continues to defy expectations in the Scottish Premiership, the 23-year-old talks to BBC Scotland about how a bout of paralysis playing rugby league helped shape his game, lectures on shooting from Stephen Dobbie, and his international hopes. Dykes' route to the Scottish top-flight was a circuitous one. Indeed, his route into football was far from straightforward. A precocious rugby league talent who was in the sights of the National Rugby League side Canberra Raiders in his youth, Dykes also played basketball and a bit of Aussie Rules football before his uncle, himself a former footballer, introduced him to the round-ball game after moving back to the Gold Coast. A trip with the Australian schoolboys' side to face England allowed him to visit family in Dumfries - where both his parents are from - and through a connection he earned a spot in the Queen of the South under-20 side, playing 14 times in 2014/15 before returning to Australia for two years. It was at this point that Dykes stopped considering football as a hobby, stopped ""stuffing about"", and started viewing it as an escape route from the factory work, ""Friends, coaches, school teachers would try and give me a kick up the a*** and say I can become something and make a living out of it,"" he recalls. ""I wasn't committed; I was too comfortable enjoying myself. And it just switched one day and I thought, 'I need to put my head down and just try here'."" The results have been pretty impressive. A return to Dumfries in 2016 brought first-team football at Queens and, after initially playing as a left winger, Dykes grew into a pivotal figure at Palmerston playing just off the prolific Dobbie. Acting as the unselfish foil while Dobbie hit an incredible 43 goals in 45 games last term, Dykes learned a lot from his strike partner, while also delivering 10 goals and 16 assists himself. Dykes' summer departure for Livingston will not be the only factor, but Dobbie has yet to score a league goal this term, with only three so far in all competitions. ""I helped him out and he helped me out,"" Dykes says. ""We knew where each other was going. Straight away we had a connection. ""He's even better when you see him every day and think 'how's that gone in?'. He used to get angry with me if I tried to lace the ball hard, he was always saying, 'just place it in the corners, side-foot it'."" Accies come from behind to beat Livingston Premiership team news & stats Dykes has made a similar impact in his short spell at Livingston, with four goals, two assists and a new contract one month into his spell in West Lothian. But much like the club he plays for, he has often been labelled as one-dimensional, and physical. Although he believes he brings more than just strength, Dykes doesn't shy away from the label. Indeed, a tale from his days playing rugby league suggests he's always relished a battle. Playing at full-back, he scythed down ""some big boy"" who rampaged past all of his team-mates and landed on him in the process. Later that night, he woke up unable to move. He had to shout for his dad, who took him to hospital but, luckily, he recovered. He laughs as he considers what his rugby upbringing has added to his football. ""It helps me. When I was younger I loved to be full-back and tackling big boys and stuff, so I just had that fearless [attitude], getting roughed up. ""I bring other things to my game, too. I'm quite intelligent. But rugby league helped with the physical side.  ""When you look at some of the defenders - they're a lot bigger than me. But I think they're not expecting my determination to get the ball. That helps me a lot."" Dykes describes Livingston as the ""perfect fit"" for him. Both are robust and hard-working, with a reputation for physicality, but with underrated finer qualities. ""Livingston just have that image now. If we see the ball there, we're going to go and win it,"" Dykes says. ""When I got sent off at Ibrox I didn't think it was a sending off. I'm not going up to try and header the ball to injure someone, I'm just jumping and looking at the ball. Other teams do it to us but we just get on with it, unless it's bad."" His ambition too, is admirable, given where he started just a few years ago. A bigger club and an international call up are on his wish list and, though he's eligible for Scotland through his parents, his preference is for Australia - but only just. Dundee United striker Lawrence Shankland's recent Scotland call despite playing in the Championship may just have made his international ambitions feel a bit more realistic. ""If I went into any team I think I could adapt to what they needed,"" Dykes says. ""Shankland deserves to be called up, you can't fault his goal-scoring.  I played against him when he was at Ayr, he was great the whole season. So I hope he does well and maybe we might play with each other one day for Scotland."""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56651735","Letter from Africa: Kenyans protest over growing debt",2021-04-07,NA,NA,"In our series of letters from African journalists, Kenyan broadcaster Waihiga Mwaura looks at the anxiety in his country over its growing debt levels. In many countries the willingness of global institutions, like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to beef up the state coffers with a loan is seen as a sign of approval. It shows that the economists in far-away Washington have confidence that the country can afford and properly manage the interest payments. But this is not how some Kenyans see things - they do not want the IMF to give the country any more money. The Kenyans on Twitter community - also known as KOT - are a force to be reckoned with. They have been compared to a swarm of bees who attack in a group and sting repeatedly until the issue is resolved or a bigger issue emerges that distracts them.  Consequently, on Monday, at the tail-end of the Easter weekend, KOT turned their attention to the IMF. Two days previously it had announced a loan of more than $2.3bn (£1.7bn) to support Kenya's pandemic response and economic reform programme.  The IMF announcement came on the heels of a survey that showed that four out of five Kenyans felt anxious, fearful or angry because of the debt burden. Hence the Twitter storm and by the end of Monday #StopGivingKenyaLoans was one of the trending hashtags here. People were also being encouraged to #SignThePetition. This was a reference to an online campaign aimed at urging the IMF to withdraw the offer, with people arguing that previous loans had not been used in a prudent manner.  Finance Minister Ukur Yatani came out to defend the loan, saying that the money was needed to support small businesses and ""forestall a greater humanitarian crisis"". But the masses online are yet to be convinced.  To understand why an IMF loan has failed to impress Kenyans, you have to go back a decade to the introduction of a new constitution.  It was designed to correct past government abuses. It says that there must be openness, accountability and public participation in how the public purse is managed.  When the current government took over in 2013 public debt stood at $16bn, it is now around $70bn - more than four times as much.  Some of that can be put down to the launching of big infrastructure projects that were sold as game changers, creating jobs and boosting the economy in the long run.  For example the new railway linking the coast to the capital, Nairobi, built with loans from China, was launched to great fanfare in 2017. But there are suspicions that it is operating at a huge loss and the government is not coming clean about the project. Some of these schemes have also been seen as avenues for corruption.  The debt discussion hit a tipping point in 2018, when an MP on parliament's budget committee said that the legislature had failed to contain the country's ballooning debt. Moses Kuria said that ""since 2014, we have sold to Kenyans this romantic story that all is well"" - but all was not well. One case of alleged corruption involving former Finance Minister Henry Rotich is currently before the courts. He is accused of inflating a contract for a public works project by more than $150m. Mr Rotich denies the charges. Earlier this year, President Uhuru Kenyatta suggested that some $18m was being lost to corruption every day. Amid all this, parliament has failed in its job to control borrowing and has approved nearly every request to incur more debt. Hence public debt now amounts to around 65% of the country's annual income - small by richer country's standards, but Kenya struggles to afford it. Nevertheless the government wants to take on more debt, but Kenyans know who is going to pay for what they see as state profligacy. Taxes have already gone up since the tax holiday, introduced because of the pandemic, ended in December. And now there are higher fuel prices. On top of this, new coronavirus restrictions have affected the ability to make money. Many here therefore are eyeing the IMF loan with suspicion, thinking it will result in more corruption and more taxation. It is not clear if the online campaign can change anything but as presidential candidates start campaigning for next year's election they may have to listen to what ordinary Kenyans are saying about how the state coffers are handled.

The ex-Arsenal boss, who is chief of global football development at Fifa, says the four-year wait between major tournaments is too long for players. Wenger, 71, has previously called for Uefa's Nations League to be scrapped, external to make room for the move. ""Organise only competitions of meaning,"" he told beIN Sports., external ""Kick all the parallel competitions out of the game. People must understand what is at stake and only have games with meaning. ""If you look at the teams in the World Cups usually the average age is 27 or 28. Because the World Cup is every four years there are very few chances to win it again because when they go back to the next World Cup they are 32 or 33. ""That's why maybe we should organise the World Cup every two years."" The World Cup has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not staged because of World War Two. Likewise, the European Championship has taken place every four years since 1960, with the exception of Euro 2020 which was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Wenger also wants football's world governing body to seriously consider condensing qualifiers for major events, reducing the amount of international breaks needed during the season. The Frenchman wants to see clear breaks for players incorporated into the international match calendar, which Fifa is due to start a review of this month. ""I believe it's needed, with the physical resources that the players need today, it's important that you have four weeks holiday,"" he said. ""I would say that's one of the solutions we will discuss is to compact the qualifiers. ""Instead of going away in October, November, September, March, June, we regroup the qualifiers all in one month or two quadruples in October and in February. At least the players can dedicate that time to the club from March until June, and we would gain four dates."" Any changes to the international calendar would have to be passed by Fifa's ruling council and possibly also a full congress of all federations"

The Conservatives have called for the airport to be returned to the private sector after ministers agreed new borrowing of up to £21.2m in cash. But Mark Drakeford says Wales would have been one of only two capitals in the world without an airport if it was not bought by Welsh ministers in 2013. The airport made a pre-tax loss of £6.6m in 2017/18. The new loan was announced earlier this week - bringing the total amount of cash the airport can borrow from the Welsh Government to £59.4m. It was former first minister Carwyn Jones who took the airport out of private hands six years ago for £53m, after passenger numbers slumped. More recently officials told AMs that, under the way it is currently run, the airport may always need public support. Criticism mounted following financial results that showed pre-tax losses - Tory AM Darren Millar claimed the airport was a ""vanity project"". Mr Drakeford defended the Welsh Government's strategy at the committee for the scrutiny of the first minister on Friday. ""I think I'm told we would be only one of two capitals in the world, if we were not to have acted in the way that we did, that didn't have an airport offering connectivity to the rest of the world. ""We continue to be strongly supportive of the course of action we have taken, prepare to back it up with funding and have no intention of selling it off."" He said only 14% of airports with scheduled flights in the world are privately owned. ""Our model in Wales is absolutely mainstream, it puts us in the same position as JFK in New York or Charles de Gaulle in Paris. ""Around the world governments recognise that a successful airport is an investment on behalf of the economy and the population of that area."" Cardiff Airport has boasted of increased passenger numbers since 2013, with the Rhoose-based business attracting around 1.7m passengers a year."

But with a big fanbase playing the current title, it's a significant challenge for the new release to keep everyone happy. David Vonderhaar, the man in charge, told Radio 1 Newsbeat his focus is making the game ""highly accessible for anybody who wants to play"". ""There are lots of people, and they all have slightly different needs,"" he says. It's something lots of CoD fans are wondering about: how will the new game, Black Ops Cold War integrate with its free-to-play battle royale counterpart, Warzone? Warzone has been one of the big hits of lockdown, gaining more than 75 million players.  It is also made by a different studio than the one in charge of Black Ops, making it difficult to bring the two versions together - both technically and creatively. David says the biggest obstacle was the technical side, but teamwork between the studios meant it was possible and players ""will lose their minds"" when they see the end result. ""It's our responsibility to plot out how Warzone is going to exist and integrate. And it's not sloppy."" Despite the popularity of free-to-play games such as Fortnite, Apex Legends and Warzone, David insists a stellar campaign mode is vital for a CoD game. It's easy to get focused on the number of people playing in battle royale games, he says, but it doesn't make campaign or multi-player ""obsolete"". ""Lots of people just want to put the game in and have their Black Ops escape fantasy for the length of a campaign,"" David explains. ""The campaign allows you to service a whole segment of people that you don't really talk about because they may not be playing online in the same way as other people."" What you get from a campaign game is ""the ability to service that audience and not forget about them"". And it's the same for multi-player too. He feels any free battle royale-type genre is going to have a lot of people playing because it's free. ""But make no mistake, a 6v6 deathmatch is still king and the purest form of the multiplayer game you can get."" The ""hardest thing"" about David's job is trying to balance keeping CoD games fresh without changing things too much and upsetting fans. ""There are a lot of people who have a specific view of what CoD needs to be. And there's an equal number of people who think you're not doing enough to be different,"" he says. But he says it's about picking what's ""very core"" and being careful ""what you fix the problems with"". Adding new and innovative features slowly is the way he prefers to go. When zombies first came in, people were like ""that's crazy talk, why would you do that?"". ""Now, if we didn't have zombies, we would be lambasted for that,"" he says. ""So you do it carefully and do it slowly."" Current circumstances make this a really exciting time because of Warzone. ""We have this free-to-play game that goes and complements it. Nobody else can do that and have both of those things working together in tandem."" And for those who think there's not enough innovation, David says ""wait and watch"". ""You're going to see this coming as part of our season of content,"" he adds. ""We're not done trying and we're going to do new things.""

"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56181084","Amnesty strips Alexei Navalny of 'prisoner of conscience' status",2021-02-24,"Sarah Rainsford","BBC News, Moscow","Amnesty International has stripped the Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny of his ""prisoner of conscience"" status after it says it was ""bombarded"" with complaints highlighting xenophobic comments that he has made in the past and not renounced. A spokesman for the human rights organisation in Moscow told the BBC that he believed the wave of requests to ""de-list"" Navalny was part of an ""orchestrated campaign"" to discredit Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic and ""impede"" Amnesty's calls for his release from custody. But on review, Amnesty International concluded that comments made by Navalny some 15 years ago, including a video which appears to compare immigrants to cockroaches, amounted to ""hate speech"" which was incompatible with the label ""prisoner of conscience"". Alexei Navalny, who was almost killed in a nerve agent attack last year, is now serving a prison sentence widely seen as punishment for his opposition activism and big-splash investigations into the corrupt lives of Russia's rich and powerful. ""We had too many requests; we couldn't ignore them,"" spokesman Alexander Artemev told the BBC, explaining that the team initially discounted Navalny's previous statements - which he has not repeated - as ""not relevant"" in the light of his current, political persecution.  Amnesty's offices worldwide, including that of the secretary general, were then hit with complaints from ""so-called concerned citizens"", Mr Artemev says, in an apparently co-ordinated move.  Some of the calls to revoke Navalny's prisoner of conscience status quoted a Twitter thread by Katya Kazbek, a freelance columnist published by the pro-Kremlin channel RT amongst others. She reposted Navalny's controversial videos after his arrest in January, describing him as an ""avowed racist"" and accusing supporters of ""whitewashing"" his nationalism. Ms Kazbek, a pseudonym, describes herself online as a ""feminist, LGBT researcher, citizen of the world"", but her posts include praise of Stalin and also echo Kremlin claims that Alexei Navalny is controlled by the US government. Since Navalny's return to Russia in January after recovering from the attempt to kill him, other English-language Twitter accounts have regularly latched on to posts to slam him as a ""vile white supremacist"". In Russia itself, state media and officials have ratcheted up their portrayal of Navalny as a stooge of the West: an enemy agent working to destabilise the country. In what Navalny claims was a crude attempt to tarnish his image, he was also found guilty this month of defaming a war-hero. Extensive coverage of that case on state TV and social media has likened him to a neo-Nazi. A second notorious video from the early 2000s shows Navalny dressed as a dentist, interspersed with images of immigrant workers, calling for the removal of ""everything that bothers us"", like rotten teeth. But in a phone-in poll to the editorially independent Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy, just 1 in 5 listeners supported Amnesty International's decision to delist Navalny.  Breakfast show host Alexander Plyushev called it ""a huge victory for Russian state propaganda"" and the move has already been hailed by RT editor Margarita Simonyan on Twitter, who noted the success of ""our columnist"" Katya Kazbek. ""Navalny has not publicly denounced his YouTube videos so our idea is that somehow he can relate to what he said,"" Amnesty's Alexander Artemev explained, though clearly uncomfortable with the decision and its implications. ""He cannot be a prisoner of conscience: that is someone who never advocates hate or violence or uses hate speech,"" Mr Artemev argued, adding that Nelson Mandela had also been stripped of the status in the 1960s after advocating the use of force against the apartheid regime in South Africa In January, Amnesty International decried Navalny's arrest as ""further evidence the Russian authorities are seeking to silence him"" and called for his immediate and unconditional release. The organisation says it will continue with those calls, and to ""do everything we can do reach that goal""."

For the Sun, British politics has ""lost one of its good guys"".  It says the outpouring of tributes for her highlights how widely she was admired as a politician and, more importantly, as a person.  In the Telegraph's words, ""few, if anybody, had a bad word to say"" about her. The paper says she is remembered not merely as a pleasant and courteous politician who cared about others, but as a resourceful and ambitious minister who had significant achievements to her name.   The i leads on the government's doubling of investment in brain cancer research in honour of Tessa Jowell, in what the paper's headline calls ""Tessa's final victory"". The speech that the head of MI5 will make in Berlin today is the lead in the Times and the Telegraph.  In the view of the Times, Andrew Parker's assessment of the range of security threats facing Britain and its allies is sober, but far from alarmist.  It says international co-operation is successfully thwarting the activities of Islamic State and rebuffing the aggressive policies of Russia and other autocratic regimes.  But the paper adds whatever Britain's future relations with the EU, it is vital that security co-operation is maintained. The Guardian says much has been said and written about the deaths of the 71 people in the Grenfell Tower fire last June.  But, the paper asks, what of their lives? Who were they? Its reporters have been talking to family and friends, and the paper has started a series of features telling their stories.  It says there were taxi drivers and teachers, football fans and churchgoers, devout Muslims, big families and working singletons - people whose lives were complicated by health issues or love, or both.

Researchers said the effect of space flight on humans had long been a concern, with astronauts losing up to 40% of their muscle after six months in orbit. The microscopic nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) will blast off at 18:00 BST on Thursday from the US. The research is being led by the universities of Nottingham and Exeter. The hope is the research could also help shed light on developing new treatments for muscular dystrophies - a group of inherited genetic conditions that gradually cause the muscles to weaken. The mission follows on from previous research carried out by the same team in 2018. This time, the new experiments will aim to identify the precise molecules that cause these problems and also test out new therapies to prevent muscle loss in zero-gravity. The worms will launch on the SpX-22, a commercial spacecraft contracted by Nasa, from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. After boarding the International Space Station the worms will be placed in a 20C incubator for five to six days. The worms, which are about 1mm (0.03in) in size, are known to share many of the same biological characteristics as humans. They are also affected by the biological changes caused by living in space - which include changes to muscle mass and the ability to use energy. Bethan Philips, associate professor of clinical, metabolic and molecular physiology at the university, said the research ""will have implications not only for astronauts but also for many situations on Earth"". ""Since the dawn of the space age, there have been concerns that space travel can be harmful to astronauts,"" she said.  Tim Etheridge, associate professor of integrative physiology at the University of Exeter, said new information from the experiment could ""build the foundations for safely sending humans on long-term missions into deep space"".

The crew - three Nasa astronauts and one from Japan's space agency Jaxa - spent almost six months in space. They flew back in SpaceX's Crew Dragon Resilience and splash-landed off Panama City, Florida at 02:56 EDT (07:56 BST). They were supposed to leave the ISS earlier, but their departure was delayed due to bad weather in Florida. Nasa said the crew were in good spirits after successfully landing in the Gulf of Mexico. Speaking at a press conference after the landing, a SpaceX crew operations and resources engineer told the astronauts: ""Dragon, on behalf of Nasa and SpaceX teams, we welcome you back to planet Earth and thanks for flying SpaceX. For those of you enrolled in our frequent flier programme, you've earned 68 million miles on this voyage."" Nasa astronaut Michael Hopkins, commander of the Crew-1 mission, replied: ""It is good to be back on planet Earth. We'll take those miles. Are they transferable?"" Confirming the safe landing on Sunday morning, Nasa said the crew were given medical checks before being flown from Pensacola, Florida to Houston, Texas. The last Nasa crew to land back on Earth at night-time was Apollo-8 - the first manned mission to the moon, which returned on 27 December 1968. This latest mission was a collaboration between Nasa and SpaceX, as part of the former's Commercial Crew programme.  SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, has become Nasa's favoured commercial space flight partner. Nasa livestreamed the moment the capsule left the ISS, moved off into the dark and began its journey back to Earth. There are still seven astronauts on the ISS, including a new crew of four people who arrived on a different SpaceX craft last week on a mission called Crew-2. As the capsule moved off, Mr Hopkins said: ""Thanks for your hospitality. We'll see you back on Earth."" The astronauts - Hopkins, Victor Glover, Shannon Walker and Soichi Noguchi - travelled into space last November on the first fully operational mission to the ISS by a vehicle made by SpaceX. Glover also made history with this mission, by becoming the first black person to hold a long-duration crew assignment on the ISS. Speaking at a remote press conference before the crew's return to Earth, he said: ""One thing that did really profoundly impact me was the very first time I got out of the seat after [the spacecraft] was safely in orbit, and I looked out the window and saw the earth from 250 miles up. ""I will never forget that moment... It wasn't about the view. It was how the view made me feel."" In May 2020, two US astronauts made a test mission to the ISS and stayed until July. This mission, Demo-2, was SpaceX's first astronaut mission. That was also the first launch to the ISS from US soil since the end of the Space Shuttle programme in 2011. Since then, the US had relied the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to send astronauts to the space station. It was also the first crewed mission run by a private company and not Nasa."

It has been set up at the former Culverhay School in Rush Hill, Bath by Shree Jagannatha Temple UK group and the Bath Hindu Community. Bath Hindu Community member Ashish Rajhansha said: ""For us it's like a dream of a lifetime that's come true having a temple in Bath.""  Lord Jagganath is celebrated with an annual festival in the summer. ""We had this dream for a long time, about 15 to 17 years but it couldn't have been possible without the help of Shree Jagannatha Temple UK,"" said Mr Rajhansha, who lives in the city. Lord Jagganath is considered to be an incarnation of the second god in the Hindu triumvirate, Lord Vishnu, the preserver and protector of the universe. He is celebrated in the Jagganath Rath Yatra or Chariot Festival held in June or July. Devotees pull an idol of Lord Jagganath and his elder brother Balabhadra and sister Subhadra along on a colourful, decorated chariot through the streets. In India, the main Lord Jagganath temple is in Puri, Odisha and dates back to the 11th Century where the Chariot Festival normally draws in thousands of people. Founder member of Shree Jagannatha Temple UK, Pratap Prusty, from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk said: ""The Jagganath culture has a massive following in India. ""In the United Kingdom there are lots of Hindu temples and usually what happens in Hinduism is we have multiple gods and their different followers - that's how Hinduism is. ""So a group of friends, devotees - we travelled to some of the UK temples and found there wasn't a temple dedicated to Jagganath. ""Jagganath was there as a 'side' deity so there weren't any proper Jagganath ceremonies or Jagganath puja (ceremony) so that's where the idea came in. ""There are so many devotees around the country in the UK and Europe who love and follow Lord Jagganath so we wanted to try and form a temple in his name."" There are thought to be about 1,700 Hindus who live in the Bath area and both groups - Bath Hindu Group and Shree Jagganatha Temple UK, have also connected with and won further support from the Bath Interfaith Group. Mr Kar, from Biggleswade, in Bedfordshire is one of the nine founding members of the Shree Jagannatha Temple UK which has 40 or so members. He said that devotees made the pledge to set up the temple during last year's Chariot Festival. ""It happened swiftly because we received unconditional support from the Bath Hindu Community who had been trying to establish a Hindu temple in Bath for the past 13 years,"" he said.  ""Now we can attract donors and members which can help the sustainability of the temple and help build a strategic temple in Bath.""  In the longer term, the group intends to buy land in Bath for a permanent temple site and will keep fundraising towards that goal in the meantime. As a result no target amount has yet been set but fundraising efforts have started for the new temple build and organisers hope to raise more awareness during this year's Chariot Festival due to be held on or as close to 12 July, depending on Covid-19 regulations. Founding member, Sushmita Pati, from Basingstoke, Hampshire said: ""Lord Jagganath is also the lord of arts and culture. ""There are eight classical forms of dance in India. Odissi is one of the oldest, and it is very closely connected with Lord Jagganath and the chauka position which actually means salutation to the Lord. ""Dance is an integral part of the Jagganath culture - it's not on the side, in a little room, it's in the main temple. ""So when the actual temple is constructed in a couple of years' time my role is to ensure the dance arena is there."" Ms Pati also hopes to build on her existing work running workshops for schools and organising trips to Hindu temples for more children to learn about the Jagganath culture. The temple based at the former Culverhay School site opened on 22 May as the Covid crisis unfolded in India. Consultant at the Royal United Hospital Dr Sharath Gangadhara, said: ""My parents and most of my family live abroad in India so we've not been able to visit them and have felt isolated. ""I have been lucky enough to go to work every day but there have been a lot of people tied inside their house, not being able to go outside apart from exercise, working from home, with the stress of having children at home. ""We're all sitting in a pressure cooker - we all need a point of release, a place of spirituality, a community centre - we need it and it's come at the right time. ""It's made a huge difference, I can see people being engaged. ""It's not just a temple, it's a place where you can discuss issues that are going on with your close friends and family and find solutions and find that inner peace."" He said the temple would also help to bring the community together offering a space where people could practise yoga, dance and the arts. In India, Jagganath temples also see Muslims being made welcome there. Mr Prusty from the Shree Jagannatha Temple UK said: ""I grew up in India, I'm used to going with different faiths and celebrating with them - so I go to a church, or temple if I have to. ""So that kind of flexibility is already there and we're really trying to achieve that in Bath and make that interfaith and inclusive as best as we can.""

The winner of the best picture Oscar has taken a total of £11.5m at the box office since its release on 7 February. Its success ends the reign of The Passion of the Christ, which had held the top spot with £11.1m since 2004. Bong Joon Ho's black comedy made history as the first international film to win the best picture Oscar. It won four Oscars overall at this year's event, also taking home the famous statuettes for best director, best international film and best original screenplay.  The film is a vicious social satire about two families from different classes in Seoul - one who live in poverty in a semi-basement, and another who live in a large home in an affluent area. The story revolves around the poor family's plans to infiltrate the life and home of the much wealthier one.   It opened in the UK later than in other countries and was able to take full advantage of the buzz created by its Academy Awards success. On its opening weekend in the the UK, Parasite made £1.4m in the run-up to the Oscars, which took place on 9 February. It climbed to the second spot in the UK the following week after it was expanded from 137 cinemas to 428 sites and increased its takings by 133%.   Globally, the film has grossed $257m (£197m) so far, with more than $50m (£38m) of that total coming from the US. The film has enjoyed the biggest post-Oscar boost for a best picture winner in the past decade. 1. Parasite:  £11.5m*, released 2020 2. The Passion of the Christ: £11.1m, released 2004 3.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55415233","Astronaut Scott Kelly: How to survive a year in space",2020-12-25,"Paul Rincon","Science editor, BBC News website","Astronaut Scott Kelly tells the BBC how he managed to live for a year on the International Space Station and why, four years into his retirement from Nasa, he would go back if someone asked. It's 16 July 2015, and all three occupants of the International Space Station are squeezing into the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that acts as their lifeboat in the event of an emergency. The crew members have been told by mission control that a large, defunct satellite is hurtling their way at 14km per second. Controllers know it will come close, but they can't track the object precisely enough to know if it will skim by or score a devastating bullseye. US astronaut Scott Kelly and Russians Gennady Padalka and Mikhail ""Misha"" Kornienko hunker down in the cramped capsule, waiting for the speeding hunk of metal to close in, following the procedures drawn up for such an eventuality by preparing to detach from the station at a moment's notice and return to Earth. It's hardly the first time Captain Kelly, a former military pilot, has been in a life-threatening situation. But the experience caused him to ponder their collective powerlessness; had the satellite hit, there would have been no time to get away.  ""Misha, Gennady and I would have gone from grumbling to one another in our cold Soyuz to being blasted in a million directions as diffused atoms, all in the space of a millisecond,"" he recalls in his memoir Endurance. Crew rotations on the ISS come with many of the mundane features of everyday life on Earth: video calls, cleaning and bad days at work. But every now and then - as on this occasion - astronauts get a stark reminder of the hostile environment beyond the comforting walls of their vessel. Since 2007, Kelly has made three separate visits to the orbiting outpost. But it was on his last flight between 2015 and 2016 that he gained worldwide recognition.  Along with Misha Kornienko, he was tasked with spending a whole year on the space station - twice the length of a regular stay. In doing so, he smashed the previous long duration spaceflight record for an American - set by astronaut Michael López-Alegría - by more than 100 days. But Kelly is just as well known for having an identical twin brother - Mark - who was also a Nasa astronaut. Mark, who is older by about six minutes, was elected as a senator for the state of Arizona in the 2020 US election.  Speaking to me by video call from his home in Colorado, Scott Kelly says there was never a moment he felt like coming home early. ""My goal was always to get to the end of the flight with as much energy and enthusiasm as I had at the beginning - and I think I did that. ""I could have stayed up there longer, if there had been a good reason. So I never really doubted my ability to do that."" Despite the fact that astronauts and cosmonauts are screened for their psychological ability to cope, he says: ""I know that other people have had hard times with it. I've seen that myself in person - some folks having a challenge being isolated like that. It's hard, but it's not so hard you can't do it."" He explains: ""I don't know if it's necessarily an introvert/extravert thing, but you definitely have to be comfortable being your own entertainment,"" adding: ""It's not for everybody."" The toughest things, he says, are not being able to go outside and experience nature, as well as the formidable daily schedule of space station tasks. Another challenge, he says, was sharing a relatively small place with the same people for so long - ""even though all those people are great"". It was a challenge successfully navigated, however, as the close quarters confinement helped forge long-standing friendships: ""I was just exchanging emails with (Nasa's) Kjell Lindgren. My wife and I did a video conference the other day with (Italian European Space Agency astronaut) Samantha Cristoforetti. I talk to Misha Kornienko and Gennady Padalka,"" he explains. The US is committed to four more years of funding for the ISS, but uncertainties remain about support for the orbiting lab after that. The space station was born in the 1990s, during an era of political détente between the US and Russia. ""The space station programme has been a great example of international co-operation in a peaceful way,"" he tells me, ""My experience with the cosmonauts on the station has always been one of professionalism, of respect, reliance on each other. ""My hope is that, whenever we do decide to put the space station in the Pacific Ocean, there is something there to replace it. For the last 20 years, all humans have not been on Earth at the same time. I would like to see that continue."" Kelly wasn't consumed by work for the whole of his year in orbit; he also managed to find time for much-needed fun and games. In what would become a viral video, he chased British astronaut Tim Peake through part of the space station dressed in a gorilla suit. Peake, it has to be said, does a good job of projecting alarm - if he is indeed acting. The suit - vacuum-packed and sent up on a supply flight - was a birthday present from Mark, and I ask Scott whether it was some sort of in-joke between the brothers. ""My brother said: 'Hey, I'm sending you a gorilla suit.' And I said: 'Why are you sending me a gorilla suit?' He said: 'Why not?'"" Kelly says, with a wry smile. ""That's about as much thought as was put into that."" The siblings were raised in suburban New Jersey by parents who were both cops. Their mother was the first female officer in the township of West Orange where they grew up, and Scott cites the determination she showed as an inspiration in his efforts to become an astronaut. Mark and Scott showed similar, early propensities for risk-taking that led to frequent injuries, including hospitalisations. But there was a point at school where Mark surged ahead in his studies, while Scott was prone to being easily distracted in class.  At college, it was the party scene competing for Scott's attention. He credits a phone conversation with Mark - who told him to lay off the socialising and knuckle down - with turning his academic fortunes around. After training as a Navy pilot, Scott was assigned to a strike squadron called the World Famous Pukin' Dogs. He flew the F-14 Tomcat - the plane featured in Top Gun - during the 1990s, and carried out combat missions during the first Gulf War.  However, Kelly was eager to become part of an even more elite group - those who have flown the space shuttle. Following his selection as a Nasa astronaut in the class of 1996, along with Mark, Scott served as a pilot on one shuttle mission before commanding another in 2007. On the shuttle, it's the commander that actually pilots the vehicle, and it's on the dizzyingly difficult landing that these skills come into their own. ""I only flew it once. It's kind of crazy to consider how much time and effort you put into doing this one piloting task and then you get to do it once, or twice,"" says Kelly. ""You've got one chance to land this. If you don't, it's not like you're adding power and coming around again. You recognise not only your colleagues are watching but a large part of the rest of the world."" The shuttle was a magnificent, if flawed, vehicle. And the world was reminded of the huge risks of space travel when, in 2003, the space shuttle Columbia broke up while returning to Earth - killing seven astronauts. Nasa's safety culture was criticised by investigations in the wake of both the Challenger and Columbia disasters. Kelly lost friends on Columbia and, when I interview him, he is preparing to address the virtual SafetyCulture Summit, alongside Charles ""Sully"" Sullenberger - who landed a stricken US Airways flight on the Hudson River - and environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich.  ""The stuff that we do is so extraordinarily risky,"" he tells me. ""Safety has to be everyone's responsibility… everyone needs to know that they are empowered to speak up if there's an issue."" When it was originally proposed that an identical twin would be sent into orbit for a year-long stay on the ISS, one group of scientists eyed a unique opportunity to study the effects of extended periods in space on the human body.  By using an Earth-bound Mark as a genetically identical ""control"", scientists would have greater confidence that any changes they were seeing in Scott were caused by the space environment. Both twins were subjected to a battery of tests measuring potential shifts in their physiology, cognitive abilities, immunity and DNA. Among other things, the results revealed genetic changes that suggested Scott's DNA was repairing itself due to damage from cosmic radiation.  Scientists also saw unexpected changes in ""caps"" on the ends of Scott's chromosomes, called telomeres, as well as shifts in his blood chemistry, body mass and gut flora. But the vast majority of these reversed themselves once he was back on Earth. Four years on, he says: ""I don't have any symptoms of anything that I can definitively point to as caused by that amount of time in space, but I do have some structural and physiological changes to my eyes - though it doesn't affect my vision."" Scientists know that some people are affected more by ocular changes in space than others. And there has been work on the genetics underlying these differences. I ask Kelly if, as we learn more about how different people respond to the space environment, these biological markers could play a bigger role in astronaut selection - perhaps even at the expense of more traditional qualities. ""I think that's not just an issue for Nasa but our society in general… it goes deeply into insurance and pre-existing conditions - whether genetic susceptibility could be considered a pre-existing condition. That is definitely an ethical conversation to be had,"" he says. The findings of the twins study were reassuring in light of space agencies' plans to send humans on a round trip to the Red Planet, which lies 34 million miles from Earth and could take nine months each way. But astronauts will be exposed to around 10 times the radiation dose they would get in Earth orbit - putting them at long-term risk of cancers and other illnesses. ""You'll either have to find a way to shield or get to Mars quicker,"" Kelly says. ""The other option is you just accept the risk."" It's a dilemma you suspect Kelly himself would have considered carefully. He retired from Nasa in 2016, and has since been writing and speaking about his experiences. With his wife, he has since moved from Houston - the hub for Nasa's human spaceflight programme - to Denver. In the four years since he left, new opportunities have opened up for travel into space, and skillsets like his are in demand. The astronaut whose long duration spaceflight record Kelly surpassed - Michael López-Alegría - is now set to return from retirement to command a privately-funded flight to the ISS aboard Elon Musk's Crew Dragon vehicle. Despite having achieved so much, it's clear that Kelly's fascination with spaceflight remains undiminished. ""If someone asked me: 'Hey do you want to fly in space?' I'd say: 'Sure, absolutely.' Depending on what I'd be launching on: I wouldn't get into a cannon and launch myself like a cannonball,"" Kelly says. ""It would have to be something that made sense, that was safe. But I wouldn't rule it out. ""If you know anyone out there who has a rocket ship they need piloting…"" Follow Paul on Twitter. Captain Scott Kelly recently participated in the virtual SafetyCulture summit, sharing his tips for how businesses can succeed in 2021 despite the challenges of the pandemic. "

Researchers in Aberdeen focused on the world's worst affected 37 countries. They examined factors including border arrivals, population density, the percentage of people living in urban areas, age, and health issues. The team said early restrictions on international travel could have made a difference in the spread. The study looked at counties including America, the UK, Spain, France, Italy and Brazil, and focused on the early stages of the pandemic. They found an increase of one million international arrivals was associated with a 3.4% rise in the mean daily increase in Covid-19 deaths. The researchers used international travel data for 2018 as a proxy for 2020 before international travel restrictions were imposed, to match travel trends with the pattern of the virus. Tiberiu Pana, one of the authors of the study, said: ""We found that international travel was the strongest predictor of mortality increase. ""Our assessment of available data indicates that very early restrictions on international travel might have made a difference in the spread of the pandemic in western Europe, including the UK. ""These findings are particularly important as the world looks to control future waves and strains of the Covid-19 pandemic and prevent related deaths."" The medical student said the level of a country's BCG vaccination coverage also appears to have a played an important role. Lead author, Prof Phyo Myint, director of the Aberdeen Clinical Academic Training Scheme said: ""This is important research, led by medical students, who have demonstrated robust use of publicly available data to inform future policies in preventing the spread of Covid-19."" The study comes as the discovery of the South Africa strain of coronavirus prompted the extension of tougher restrictions for all travellers arriving directly into Scotland, On Wednesday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said UK government plans to put people arriving from high risk countries on a ""red list"" and require them to quarantine in hotels ""does not go far enough"".

The three men - Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo - are to spend three months aboard the Tianhe module some 380km (236 miles) above the Earth. It will be China's longest crewed space mission to date and the first in nearly five years. The crew successfully docked with the space station just over seven hours after the launch.  The moment of contact was met with applause from mission control in China.  Their Shenzhou-12 capsule took off atop its Long March 2F rocket on Thursday.  Lift-off from the Jiuquan satellite launch centre in the Gobi desert was at 09:22 Beijing time (01:22 GMT). The launch and subsequent mission are another demonstration of China's growing confidence and capability in the space domain. In the past six months, the country has returned rock and soil samples to Earth from the surface of the Moon, and landed a six-wheeled robot on Mars - both highly complex and challenging endeavours. The primary objective for Commander Nie Haisheng and his team on the Shenzhou-12 mission is to bring the 22.5-tonne Tianhe module into service.  ""I have a lot of expectations,"" Mr Nie said ahead of the launch.  ""We need to set up our new home in space and test a series of new technologies. So, the mission is tough and challenging. I believe with the three of us working closely together, doing thorough and accurate operations, we can overcome our challenges. We have the confidence to complete the mission."" This 16.6m-long, 4.2m-wide Tianhe cylinder was launched in April. It is the first and core component in what will eventually be a near 70-tonne orbiting outpost, comprising living quarters, science labs and even a Hubble-class telescope to view the cosmos. The various elements will be launched in turn over the course of the next couple of years. The construction will be accompanied by regular cargo deliveries, as well as crew expeditions.  The Chinese authorities kept the identities of the Shenzhou-12 astronauts under wraps until a press conference on Wednesday. A fighter pilot, Nie Haisheng, 56, is said to be China's oldest astronaut in space.  He is a veteran of two previous flights, which included a 15-day visit in 2013 to the prototype space station, Tiangong-1. This has since been de-orbited.  His crewmates, Liu Boming (54) and Tang Hongbo (45), are also from an air force background. Liu's earlier spaceflight experience was on the Shenzhou-7 mission in 2008 that saw him participate in China's first ever spacewalk. Mr Tang is the rookie on this occasion, having never before gone into orbit. The food, fuel and equipment the trio will need during their stay aboard Tianhe was delivered by a robotic freighter last month.   This freighter is still attached, and the men will make unpacking its supplies their first task as soon as they've settled in. Included in the delivery are two spacesuits they'll need to conduct spacewalks on the exterior of Tianhe. China has in recent years made no secret of its space ambitions. It has poured significant funding into its space efforts, and in 2019 became the first country to send an un-crewed rover to the far side of the Moon. But it's had to go at it alone in developing a space station, in part because it has been excluded from the International Space Station project.  The US, which leads that partnership with Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan, will not co-operate with the Asian nation in orbit. For its part, China says it is open to foreign involvement on its station. In the first instance, this means hosted scientific experiments. For example, the Shenzhou-12 crew will conduct cancer investigations that are led from Norway. And on the outside of the station, there is an Indian-developed telescopic spectrograph to study ultraviolet emissions coming from deep space, from the likes of exploded stars. But, long term, there probably also will be visits to the station by non-Chinese nationals. Russia, which has shared technology in the past with China, has mentioned the possibility of sending its cosmonauts. At Wednesday's press conference to introduce the Shenzhou-12 crew, Ji Qiming, an assistant director with China's human spaceflight agency, said: ""We welcome co-operation in this regard in general. ""It is believed that, in the near future, after the completion of the Chinese space station, we will see Chinese and foreign astronauts fly and work together,"" he added. President Xi Jinping has also thrown his support behind the country's space endeavours and the Chinese state media regularly cast the ""space dream"" as one step in the path to ""national rejuvenation""."

"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-56657023","Leeds Bradford Airport development plan ruling delayed",2021-04-06,NA,NA,"A £150m proposal to redevelop Leeds Bradford Airport has been delayed to allow Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick more time to consider it. Plans to demolish existing buildings and build a new terminal were approved by Leeds City Council in February. But that decision was referred to the government after objectors said it would contribute to climate change. The government said it needed time to allow for ""proper consideration"" of requests for the plan to be called in. A date for a final decision has not been set, but the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has put in place an order which prevents Leeds City Council from granting planning permission without special authorisation. Leeds Bradford Airport said the new terminal was not an expansion as it could already expand passenger numbers with its existing facilities. It added that the replacement building would be a more efficient and sustainable development helping it to achieve its carbon net-zero goals by 2023. A spokesman for Leeds Bradford Airport said: ""We acknowledge the deadline extension and hope the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government will uphold Leeds City Council's approval for our replacement terminal, which will deliver thousands of new jobs and support the region's economy."" The airport estimates the project will support 12,650 permanent jobs across the Leeds City Region, as well as creating 850 construction-related jobs. The site handles about four million passengers annually and has already been granted permission to increase that to seven million over a 10-year-period. In July 2020, a group of climate scientists warned the expanded airport's greenhouse gas emissions would be higher than those allowed for the whole of Leeds in 10 years' time. Environmental campaigners Greenpeace said the delay over a final decision on the redevelopment plans was a sign the government was ""starting to clock the catastrophic impacts of this proposed expansion"". Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK's head of politics, said: ""But we're just months away from hosting critical global climate talks, and this climate-wrecking mega project is clearly incompatible with our plans to cut emissions, so why only delay the decision and not just call it in now?"" Meanwhile, in a tweet, the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport, said: ""No airport anywhere should expand. Delaying this decision is good news."" Mr Jenrick's decision to - in effect - kick this local issue into the long grass has national significance because seven other airports as well as Leeds Bradford also want to expand their operations. They'll all be less optimistic now. To be clear, the Leeds plan isn't dead. But it doesn't bode well for the airport that Mr Jenrick says he needs more time to decide whether to kill it or not. His note to the airport didn't spell out his reasoning, but it's reasonable to assume Mr Jenrick wanted to avoid another bruising like the one he suffered recently after tacitly approving a plan for a coal mine in Cumbria.  He was forced into a U-turn on that issue. So when will we get a final ruling? The government won't say, but my guess is we'll have to wait for the government's transport decarbonisation strategy due in the coming months that will show how all emissions from transport can be reduced.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57815034","Foreign aid: Covid costs mean we have to cut payments, says PM",2021-07-13,NA,NA,"Boris Johnson has defended the government's decision to cut foreign aid, saying this is needed during the ""economic hurricane"" caused by Covid. MPs are voting on whether to reverse the reduction on development spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, brought in earlier this year. Opening a Commons debate, the prime minister said this was a temporary cut made to help reduce public borrowing. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""indefinite"". The government has faced cross-party criticism over the reduction, which amounts to almost £4bn. Many Conservative MPs have spoken out against the move, announced last November despite a commitment to spending 0.7% in the party's 2019 election manifesto. Meeting the 0.7% figure was made law in 2015, and it is an internationally recognised target, and charities such as Oxfam and ActionAid have warned that projects are being called off as a result of the cuts. If MPs defeat the government in the vote, spending will revert to 0.7% of national income by January next year. If the government wins, it will happen only when national debt is falling and borrowing is no longer used for day-to-day spending.  Last month, 30 Conservative MPs supported an amendment to a parliamentary bill, aimed at forcing the government to meet the 0.7% target. If they oppose the cut again later, another 14 or so Tories would have to join them to ensure a government defeat. Mr Johnson told MPs ministers had spent £407bn during the pandemic to ""shelter our people from an economic hurricane never before experienced in living memory"". He added: ""There must inevitably be consequences."" The prime minister said that this year national debt was expected to reach 100% of economic output, ""the highest for nearly six decades"". He added that the reduction was temporary and the UK could ""take pride that the UK will still contribute at least £10bn of our GDP"" to aid. ""This is not an argument about principle,"" Mr Johnson said. ""The only question is when we return to 0.7% and my purpose today is to describe how we propose to achieve this shared goal in an affordable way."" Governments only call votes if they think they can win.  Ministers will hope the concession of a vote, the offer of clarity about when aid might increase and the lack of time their opponents have had to organise will give them an edge and soften the Tory rebellion.  When it comes to whipping, the Treasury also has deep pockets and who knows what goodies might be on offer to dissident rebel MPs in the upcoming Spending Review?  If the government wins, there will be consequences.  The current status quo is that Downing Street is under political pressure to return aid spending to 0.7% of national income next year.  But if the Treasury wins today, that will not happen. Aid spending will be locked in for years.  How long will depend not just on the economy, but on Treasury's tax and spend decisions and its interpretation of some rather loose tests.  Both sides in this debate accept UK aid cuts have a material impact.  It is just a question of priorities - responsible belt-tightening at home or generosity abroad. But if the UK cuts aid by £4bn every year, then millions overseas will suffer.  But Sir Keir, who confirmed Labour would vote against the government, said the cut was ""not in the national interest"", adding: ""Every member here was elected on a manifesto promise to retain the 0.7% target."" ""Every living prime minister thinks this is wrong,"" he added. ""There is only one prime minister who is prepared to do this and he is sitting there."" He later added: ""Cutting aid will increase costs and have a big impact on our economy. Development aid reduces conflict. It reduces disease and people fleeing from their homes. ""It is a false economy to pretend that this is some sort of cut that doesn't have consequences."" Former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, one of the Conservative MPs who have been highly critical of the cut, said she would also vote against the government, but ""with regret"". ""We made a promise to the poorest people in the world,"" she added. ""The government has broken that promise."" And former Brexit Secretary David Davis called the cut to aid spending ""morally reprehensible"". On Saturday, a group of philanthropists, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said they would provide £93.5m emergency funding to cover some of the UK's reduction."

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49359517",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Stephanie Frappart's handling of Liverpool's Super Cup victory over Chelsea on Wednesday has been hailed by media outlets across Europe. Frappart made history in Istanbul as the first woman to referee a major European men's match. Her performance was described by outlets as a genuine display of professionalism, rather than a token step towards gender equality. ""Stephanie Frappart will never forget yesterday. Neither will her assistants Manuela Nicolosi and Michelle O'Neill,"" Spanish paper Sport said. ""And not just because they were the European Super Cup referees, but because they did it at such an excellent level.""  Frappart, who grew up playing football for local teams in the Paris region, was hailed in the French media too.  France's Sport.Orange reported what it called a level-headed statement at the pre-match news conference: ""We aren't afraid, because we're always ready for any match […] We have to demonstrate that on a physical, technical and tactical level, we have the same capacities that men do, so I'm not afraid."" Ouest-France quoted Liverpool manager Jorgen Klopp's praise for the all-female referee team: ""After the match, I told them that if we'd played as well as they refereed, we'd have won 6-0… I couldn't have more respect for Stephanie Frappart.""  French magazine L'Express quoted Lille manager Christophe Galtier praising Frappart's ""diplomatic nature"".  ""As male managers, we're under a lot of pressure, our tempers can flare up,"" Galtier said. ""All she has to do is give us a look, a smile, a gesture, and all of that stops.""  In Germany, Tagesspiegel said Frappart's refereeing ""is now another beautiful sign on the road to gender equality in an environment still dominated by men"". It added: ""The fact that this path is being taken rather slowly is of secondary importance today.""   Sueddeutsche Zeitung noted that although it was always best if referees are not discussed after the final whistle, Frappart is ""being talked about more and more often - though in this case that is a good thing"". Over in Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport said Frappart ""aced the exam"".  The fact that veteran referee Roberto Rosetti also praised her, the paper said, meant that ""this wasn't just an experiment or a decision motivated by political correctness… You don't even realise she's there for most of the match, which is generally a sign the referee is doing a good job"".  But many Twitter users pointed out that that Iranian broadcaster Varzesh TV tried to avoid airing close-ups of the referee. Others noted that the state broadcaster censored images of Frappart shaking hands with the team captains. ""It's shameful,"" one Iranian user said. ""If they show a close-up of the female referee, fire will rain down on us,"" joked another."

Sumitomo Forestry said it has started research on tree growth and the use of wood materials in space.  The partnership will begin experimenting with different types of wood in extreme environments on Earth. Space junk is becoming an increasing problem as more satellites are launched into the atmosphere. Wooden satellites would burn up without releasing harmful substances into the atmosphere or raining debris on the ground when they plunge back to Earth.  ""We are very concerned with the fact that all the satellites which re-enter the Earth's atmosphere burn and create tiny alumina particles which will float in the upper atmosphere for many years,"" Takao Doi, a professor at Kyoto University and Japanese astronaut, told the BBC.  ""Eventually it will affect the environment of the Earth."" ""The next stage will be developing the engineering model of the satellite, then we will manufacture the flight model,"" Professor Doi added. As an astronaut he visited the International Space Station in March 2008. During this mission, he became the first person to throw a boomerang in space that had been specifically designed for use in microgravity. Sumitomo Forestry, part of the Sumitomo Group, which was founded more than 400 years ago, said it would work on developing wooden materials highly resistant to temperature changes and sunlight. The wood it is using is an ""R&D secret"" a spokesman for the company told the BBC.  Experts have warned of the increasing threat of space junk falling to Earth, as more spacecraft and satellites are launched. Satellites are increasingly being used for communication, television, navigation and weather forecasting. Space experts and researchers have been investigating different options to remove and reduce the space junk. There are nearly 6,000 satellites circling Earth, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). About 60% of them are defunct (space junk). Research firm Euroconsult estimates that 990 satellites will be launched every year this decade, which means that by 2028, there could be 15,000 satellites in orbit. Elon Musk's SpaceX has already launched more than 900 Starlink satellites and has plans to deploy thousands more. Space junk travels at an incredibly fast speed of more than 22,300 mph, so can have cause considerable damage to any objects it hits.   In 2006 a tiny piece of space junk collided with the International Space Station, taking a chip out of the heavily reinforced window."

The programme included 600 events - a third fewer than 2019 - with 200 streamed online and available on demand for the rest of the year. Guest speakers at Monday's closing night event included First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, actor Brian Cox and writer Irvine Welsh. Organisers said there had been a significant shift in booking behaviour. Festival director Nick Barley reported that more people than ever booked on the day, while free events, an outdoor screen and ""pay what you can"" ticket prices had allowed them to attract a new and diverse audience. ""This year was always going to be a bit of an unknown,"" Mr Barley said. ""But an overwhelmingly positive response from audiences old and new, local residents, festival goers and individuals from every corner of the world has made it an absolute joy to deliver. ""We are under no illusions that this is only the beginning of our build-back journey, and our focus now is to consolidate and respond to what we've learned from the year as we plan our return to the Edinburgh College of Art."" The Edinburgh Fringe issued more than 2.2 million tickets - the sixth highest figure in the event's 75-year history. Although the overall tally was around 25% down on the 2019 figure, there were fewer shows and venues. Ticket sales varied enormously across the Fringe's 273 venues. Some, like Assembly, Gilded Balloon, Pleasance and Underbelly, were 25% down on 2019 sales. Others offered smaller programmes. Summerhall presented 30% fewer shows, but were only down 7% at the box office, compared with 2019. Fringe Producer Tom Forster said artists presenting ""brave and bold work"" at the venue had ""won multiple awards"". ""This reduced programme - leaning into the idea of building back better - does also mean, on balance, more tickets sold for each show across the venue,"" he said.  Others like TheSpaceUK presented the same number of shows as 2019. It sold 165,000 tickets, compared with 174,000 in 2019, representing a 3% fall. The organisation's artistic director, Charles Pamment, said sensible ticketing prices, extensive media and marketing support and being one of the few venues to return in 2021 with a full programme ""meant that strong relationships with audiences and artists have continued to develop positively"". The Edinburgh International Festival said last year's outdoor programme, which was largely attended by locals, had helped organisers return to a bigger programme inside their regular venues like the Usher Hall and the Playhouse.  They offered 92 events this year, compared with 155 in 2019, and distributed 150,000 tickets - including 34,000 for free shows - which was around 7% down. All the summer festivals had to contend with the ongoing challenges of the coronavirus pandemic and the rising cost of living. Affordable accommodation was deemed the most pressing issue for the future and, according to some operators, ""a major threat for everyone involved in the festival"". Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the Fringe Society, said this year's festival was ""the first step"" on a long road towards recovery and renewal.  ""The hard work of thousands of artists, and hundreds of venues, producers and staff has combined to deliver the 75th anniversary festival during one of the most challenging summers on record,"" she added. ""We recognise the significant amount of work that is still required to support the long-term sustainability of this phenomenal festival.  ""As we review and discuss all the learnings from this year, our focus this autumn will be on planning for the 2023 Edinburgh Fringe."""

It's a day to ""make a difference for men and boys"" and tackles issues including the high male suicide rate, and mental health and social problems. We're taking a look at the sportsmen who have been, and still are, making a difference inside and outside sport through speaking up about mental health and other struggles, as well as those who are doing good work for charity. Ex-footballers David Beckham and Didier Drogba have been involved in widely publicised ventures in Africa, while boxer Tyson Fury pledged to donate his purse from the Deontay Wilder fight to the homeless. Before last year's World Cup, Kylian Mbappe revealed he was giving his £17,000-per-match appearance fees to a charity providing sporting activities for disabled children. And while there are countless sportsmen who do good, here are are four who we think deserve special recognition: Just before last year's World Cup, England and Tottenham defender Danny Rose revealed he had been living with depression, which he says was triggered by a combination of injury and family tragedy. He disclosed his illness in a frank interview and was later praised by Prince William for his honesty and bravery in speaking out. But Rose claims his revelation was brought up during talks about a possible transfer later that summer. ""I was speaking to another club in the summer and they said, 'the club would like to meet you, just to check that you're not crazy,' because of what I'd said and what I'd been through,"" he said.  ""I was embarrassed, as whatever I've been through I like to think it doesn't affect me doing my job."" Following Rose's interview, and various other players and fans talking out about mental health, the FA launched a campaign to ""generate the biggest ever conversation around mental health"" to ""show the world mental fitness is just as important as physical fitness"". When Juan Mata launched his Common Goal initiative, he said he hoped to ""change the world, even if only in some small way"". The Manchester United midfielder pledged to donate 1% of his salary to charity, and called for fellow footballers to join him in doing the same. ""I am leading this effort, but I don't want to be alone,"" he said. And two years on, more than 130 people have joined him. ""We can use the platform that we have to really be honest with ourselves, to really share our values or to really say what we think, or what football should be aiming for,"" he said. ""I think the power of sport and of football in particular is huge and we should all realise that."" Former Wales rugby union captain Gareth Thomas revealed he is HIV positive, and wants to ""break the stigma"" around the condition. Thomas, who came out as gay in 2009, is thought to be the first UK sportsman to go public about living with the virus. Since making the announcement, support for the 45-year-old ex-British and Irish Lions skipper has flooded in. It included a message from the Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, who said: ""Gareth, you are an absolute legend! In sharing your story of being HIV+, you are saving lives and shattering stigma, by showing you can be strong and resilient while living with HIV."" He filmed the documentary HIV and Me which aired in October, and was met with further praise from fans calling him a ""hero"". Rio Ferdinand's wife, Rebecca, died of breast cancer in May 2015, aged 34, and since then he has spoken openly about how life has changed for him and their children. This has included filming a Bafta-winning documentary called 'Being Mum and Dad', in which he took viewers and fans on his personal journey on coping with grief, and how he was helping his three children. In sharing his personal journey with the nation, he was praised for showing people should ""talk more"" and ""not shy away"" from grief. Important subjects, and incredible bravery.

These are initial fees charged for dropping off someone as close to a terminal as possible. The biggest hikes in so-called kiss and fly charges are at Southampton and Belfast International, the RAC found. Airports argue the higher fees are to deter drivers from lingering around and help to keep flight costs down. The Airport Operators Association, which represents airports in the UK, told the BBC the increased revenue helped ""keep charges to airlines lower"" and helped ""maximise the range of flights that can be offered to all passengers"". Short-stay parking areas around terminals usually have barriers for entry and exit. Drivers have to buy a ticket to get in and pay for the time they stay to get out. Southampton International airport raised its fee from £4 to £6 for 20 minutes while Belfast International has hiked prices from £1 to £3 for 10 minutes. A spokesperson for AGS Airports, which owns and operates Southampton, said the funds received through higher charges were important in ""supporting the airport's operational costs, which have increased significantly"". Belfast said the higher charges would be used to fund a ""wider capital investment programme"". The airport is due to begin the construction of a new £20m security building. The airport with the highest minimum payment is Stansted where the fee is £7 for 15 minutes, but other airports charge £5 for just five or 10 minutes. However, six of the busiest UK airports have frozen drop-off charges since last summer. Alongside Stansted: Three airports offer free-drop off outside the departure terminal. These are Cardiff, London City and Inverness. For passengers that are being dropped off by taxis or private hire cars, they will most likely have fees added to their fares. Many airports offer free options for dropping passengers off in mid or long-stay car parks connected to terminals by buses. The RAC argues that the increased drop-off charges are far too high to charge drivers for such short periods of time - particularly if they are dropping off people with limited mobility or young families.  Nicholas Lyes, head of roads policy at the RAC, has been tracking drop-off charges since 2016 and said putting them up had ""become something of an annual ritual"". ""Thankfully the proportion of airports hiking fees this year is lower than last year, but that will be little consolation as charges across the board have never been so high,"" he said. Research. Check out the drop-off facilities and fees on the airport's website. Terminal forecourt drop-off areas are likely to be the most expensive. Have your payment ready. Once you have found out how to pay, ensure you have payment ready to hand. Say your goodbyes early. Bid your farewells before you get to the airport. Check your taxi fare includes a drop-off fee. If you're booking a taxi to take you to the airport, check to see whether the fare includes or excludes any drop-off fees.

The group - chaired by anti-Brexit Labour MP Chuka Umunna - warns in a report that anti-immigrant rhetoric is making it harder for new arrivals. It calls for government action to encourage ""meaningful social mixing"". Leave Means Leave said there was nothing poisonous about wanting to take back control of Britain's borders. In its report, the cross-party group on social integration, says migrants should be treated as Britons-in-waiting who can eventually gain citizenship instead of being viewed as security threats. Mr Umunna said: ""The demonisation of immigrants, exacerbated by the poisonous tone of the debate during the EU referendum campaign and after, shames us all and is a huge obstacle to creating a socially integrated nation. ""We must act now to safeguard our diverse communities from the pedlars of hatred and division while addressing valid concerns about the impact of immigration on public services, some of which can contribute to local tensions."" The group calls for local authorities to be given a legal duty to promote integration and for new arrivals to be put on the path to citizenship straight away. It also proposes that businesses employing large numbers of immigrants should pay a levy that could be used to help ease the strains of migration on communities. And the group repeats a call it made last year to allow different parts of the UK to set their own immigration policy, an idea rejected by the Home Office. Critics have accused the group of trying to keep EU freedom of movement through the back door.  Richard Tice, co-chairman of pro-Brexit campaign Leave Means Leave, said: ""This is typical of Chuka Umunna - a member of the metropolitan liberal elite who is completely oblivious to the concerns of millions of hard-working British families across the country. ""There is nothing 'poisonous' about wanting to take back control over Britain's borders, in fact he should be ashamed to suggest there is."" He claimed Mr Umunna was ""in complete denial about the referendum result and is trying to retain a form of freedom of movement which is completely against the democratic will of the British people"". The cross-party group visited areas of high immigration in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Dagenham and found migrants are increasingly leading separate lives to the rest of the community. Under a regional system, local leaders would be able to assess the impact of immigration on public services and community cohesion and create a certain number of visas to meet local economic needs, according to the report. The majority of MPs and peers in the group are Labour members, but it also includes Conservative, Lib Dem and SNP MPs.  It has previously called for compulsory English lessons for people moving to the UK who cannot speak the language."

Following the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis,  the chancellor cut the foreign aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of total national income - a reduction of around £4bn. The Foreign Office controls 80% of aid spending - £8bn - and the priorities were set out by Mr Raab in a written statement. More than £1bn will be spent on Covid and global health, £500m towards tackling climate change and £400m on getting girls into education.  Mr Raab said it was a ""challenging financial climate"" due to Covid-19, but said the government had sought ""maximum strategic coherence, impact and value for taxpayers' money"". But aid charities said even the priority areas were receiving less than before, and £500m less was being spent on humanitarian aid. The 200 charities, which also include Christian Aid and Care International, said: ""Today's announcement is a tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people the UK once supported, and for the UK's reputation as a trusted development partner.  ""The government has not even spared countries ravaged by humanitarian crisis, disease, war and poverty."" Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, accused the government of ""making cuts with no consideration for the human harm they will cause"" after reducing aid in Yemen, ""the world's biggest humanitarian crisis"". The government announced it was cutting foreign aid last November but it has still to say precisely where the axe will fall. Charities are waiting anxiously to see which programmes will lose funding, and which will survive.  But we are getting some indications from government now about its priorities: climate change, Covid and global health, girls' education, supporting open societies, trade and economic development and so on.  The numbers announced by the Foreign Office allow charities to calculate how much less will be spent on each area than before. That will help them plan. What these numbers will not do is diminish the controversy.  Ministers argue the decision to cut aid has been made, it is time to decide how best to make it happen.  But aid charities and many MPs - including a goodly number of Conservatives - still oppose the cuts and are working to stop them. Plans for a legal challenge are being considered.  Critics say the government can't ignore a legally binding target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid.  The FCDO reckons it can make the cuts without holding a vote to change the law. Campaigners might want a judge to decide who is right.  For now, the government is pressing ahead with cuts it says are needed to keep the Treasury in funds for other priorities.  Of the £8bn, the Foreign Office will give more than £3bn to multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank. Half of all UK bilateral aid will be spent in Africa, a third in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia. The remaining humanitarian aid budget, focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan, is £906m. Mr Raab also announced he would cut Foreign Office aid to China by 95%, to £900,000. But other parts of government, such as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, give more aid to China and have yet to say if they will cut their payments too."

He opens another browser window to show off the mobile app he has been working on.  ""For a beginner, I think I'm really good,"" says Farah, smiling. ""I've always been obsessed with problem-solving and technology."" The 26-year-old studied business administration at university, but with Gaza suffering one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, it was hard to find a job when he graduated.  Then, six months ago, he took a coding course at Gaza Sky Geeks. Now, he has already built one app for a British start-up, and is looking for more freelance work. This tech hub was set up by Google and the NGO, Mercy Corps and is now backed by other big names in IT, like Microsoft, as well as international donors and regional businesses.  ""Once you're into programming, you're essentially not bound by the boundaries of Gaza,"" Farah says. With its bombed-out buildings and severe power and water shortages, Gaza seems a long way from the information superhighway.  Haggling in the market is the norm here, not e-commerce. But that does not stop some young people from dreaming that they can turn this strip into the Arab world's Silicon Valley, or at least an outsourcing hub.  Arabic is one of the fastest growing languages on the internet. Shams Abu Hassanein did workshops on freelancing at Gaza Sky Geeks and now makes a living from infographics. She designs flyers, brochures and social media posts in English and Arabic. ""This job has brought light to my future and my family's,"" Shams says. ""Daily, I learn something new. Freelancing is a way into the wide and enormous world."" Two-thirds of the nearly two million residents of Gaza are under 25. Most have never left this tiny territory just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide.  For more than a decade, since the Islamist movement Hamas took full control, Gaza has been kept under a tight blockade by Israel and Egypt, for what they say is their own security.  There are controls on goods allowed in and out and on travel. Israel, like the US and EU, sees Hamas as a terrorist group and says it acts to stop weapons getting to it. ""Gaza's educated youth are often referred to as a 'wasted generation' due to the lack of opportunities,"" says Wafa Ulliyan, director of programmes at Gaza Sky Geeks. Its brightly decorated workspace in Gaza City has high-speed internet and constant electricity.  Already, the coding classes here have led to remote work for employers in the US and Europe. Dozens of freelancer training graduates have earned more than $400,000 (£305,000; €340,000) altogether. It has helped nearly 30 start-ups to attract seed money and investment.   New entrepreneurs are now pitching online services for the local market - such as Palestinian wedding planning - and the region, with a platform for tourism in the United Arab Emirates, for example. ""Our international mentors are amazed at the great talent, passion and skills that our youth have,"" Wafa Ulliyan says.   ""Many say they could run our start-up acceleration programmes in London or San Francisco given the quality of the products. This is the real image that needs to be tagged to Gaza."" During the past six months, violent demonstrations on the Gaza-Israel border have been the focus of global attention.   At least 190 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire and one Israeli soldier was shot dead by a Palestinian sniper.  Israel says its troops defend the border and stop the fence being breached.  The protests began with a demand for Palestinians to return to their ancestral land that now lies in Israel, but many believe they have been fuelled by the desperate situation.  ""The economy was a key decisive element in 'the Great March' and this turmoil,"" says economist Omar Shaban.  Recent steps taken by Palestinian leaders in the occupied West Bank to try to pressure Hamas to give up power over Gaza are squeezing people's finances even more and there are new fears about the impact of cuts in US aid. ""To fix Gaza, it's about bringing hope to people, more jobs, lifting the siege and allowing exports to get out,"" Omar Shaban says. The UN and Egypt have been trying to broker a long-term ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that could lead to an easing of the blockade. The deep rift between the main Palestinian political groups is a big obstacle. Another block is Israel wanting Hamas to return two of its citizens held in Gaza and the remains of two soldiers killed in fighting in 2014. Hamas demands a release of Palestinians jailed in Israel in return.  Young adults in Gaza have grown up with constant hardships and three full-scale armed conflicts between Israel and Hamas militants.   While life remains extremely difficult, there are many who are determinedly using technology to work their way around the problems. ""I think the future is programming, you can find any job in programming,"" says 25-year-old, Marwa Hassanein, another coder.  ""I told myself I can learn and nothing's impossible"". "

Wales are two play-off games away from qualifying for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1958. Amnesty International claim migrant workers are being exploited in Qatar building stadiums for the tournament. Qatar's government said it has ""never shied away from acknowledging that its labour system is...a work in progress."" Denmark have said they will put ""extra pressure"" on Fifa over human rights concerns in the build-up to the World Cup. Norway, Netherlands and Germany players have protested about alleged human rights abuses in Qatar. Asked in an interview with the BBC Politics Wales programme if the Welsh players would protest, the Football Association of Wales' chief executive Noel Mooney said: ""I certainly haven't discussed it with the players.  ""I haven't heard anything about that to be fair, that's up to the players."" Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar. Asked what he would say to Wales' LGBTQ+ fans who might want to travel to the World Cup, Mr Mooney said: ""My advice would be that they should go to the match, to the games and follow us in Qatar at the World Cup.  ""We'll make sure that whatever we have to do to protect people is in place.  ""This is an opportunity, rather than being negative about it, we see it as an opportunity to engage, to give our view of how people should be treated to them,"" he added. The Qatar government said: ""Qatar rejects Amnesty's assertion that labour reforms have not translated into changes on the ground for hundreds of thousands of migrant workers. ""Every year, more companies are held accountable for violating the law.  ""Systemic reform is a long-term process and shifting the behaviour of every company takes time."" In a wide-ranging interview with Politics Wales, Mr Mooney also said he could see a ""tension"" between comments made by the FAW around Ryan Giggs' involvement in the Wales squad. The Wales manager will stand trial in January, accused of assault, as well as coercive and controlling behaviour. He denies the charges. After Giggs was arrested last year, the FAW said he would ""not be involved"" with the Wales team. But assistant boss Robert Page has said Giggs was ""a phone call away"" and that he would ""have an input and rightly so."" Asked if he could see a tension between the FAW and Page's comments around whether Ryan Giggs was involved in the squad or not, Mr Mooney replied: ""I can see how there would be a tension on it, yeah, I can see how there is."" But Mr Mooney went on to say he was ""not aware"" that Ryan Giggs had ""any input into any of our squads"". Former Wales women's boss Jayne Ludlow has called for her players to earn equal pay with the men's team for playing for Wales. Mr Mooney said the FAW would be ""getting really close to that [equal pay] if not full parity on pay in the next year or so."" He said the FAW ""significantly increased"" the pay for women's internationals and they ""now use the same pitches, the same chartered flights, the same chefs, in fact they've got additional care"". With a study claiming Welsh football is worth £550m to the country, the FAW has called on the Welsh government to invest more in the grassroots game. An audit of the pitches required in Wales is being conducted over the next few months. But Mr Mooney said he thought the ""bill will come in north of £100 million"". He added that he would like to see a ""significant increase in investment into grassroots facilities"" in the upcoming draft Welsh government budget for the next financial year."

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41816728",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Everton teenager Beni Baningime says he has yet to decide whether to play for England or the Democratic Republic of Congo at international level.  The midfielder, 19, impressed on his first-team debut at Chelsea in the Carabao Cup last week before making his Premier League bow on Sunday.  ""I haven't thought about that yet really,"" he told BBC Sport when asked which country he would represent.  ""My dad and I will have to speak about it. We're focussing on the club first.""  ""Hopefully when we start winning - I need to get that bit done - then I will have to think about where I am going to go.""  Baningime was born in the Congolese capital Kinshasa but he has been at Everton's academy since he was nine.  He was thrust into the spotlight at Stamford Bridge after Morgan Schneiderlin fell ill prior to kick-off, before caretaker coach David Unsworth turned to him again at half-time of Sunday's 2-0 loss at the King Power Stadium.  ""It's just great that David Unsworth has given me the opportunity to play,"" said Baningime, who played at the base of a midfield diamond against Leicester. ""He said 'just do what you normally do with the ball' and that gave me confidence. It was great. I would have wanted to win the game but that didn't happen.""  Unsworth, who has regularly managed Baningime in Everton's Under-23 side, was full of praise for the youngster after he showed his mettle in an energetic display for the Premier League strugglers.  ""I have total faith in Beni,"" Unsworth told Everton's official website. , external ""He is a top young player and for him to perform in a game and a half like he has done, in really difficult circumstances - he deserves a lot of credit.""  Baningime, meanwhile, has been revelling in his experiences of the last week.  ""I have grown up watching Wayne Rooney and always loved him, (Cesc) Fabregas is a World Cup winner - it's unbelievable to be on the same pitch as these guys,"" he explained.   ""But when you are on the pitch, you don't think like this - you just play. You don't think about the names.""  Baningime only made his debut for Everton's Under-23 side last season, a year when they won their league, following his promotion from the Under-18 team.  Having signed a new deal this month that will keep him at Everton until 2020 this week, he is among a growing list of young talent that has broken into the Everton first team in recent times.  He said these players - such as Tom Davies, Jonjoe Kenny and Dominic Calvert-Lewin - and other Africans at the club have served as an inspiration. ""I look to up to Idrissa Gana Gueye. He's someone I like to play like, and I love how he plays,"" said Baningime of the Senegal international.  ""It gives you inspiration that one day you can be just like them.""  "

The National Galleries of Scotland warn they'll ""struggle to keep their doors open"". The CEO of Creative Scotland tells the culture committee that many organisations are ""fighting for survival"" and before the morning is out, the charity which runs the Edinburgh International Film Festival has called in the administrators. It's a challenging time for anyone involved in the arts, but Nicola Benedetti has arrived in her post, as director of the Edinburgh International Festival, fighting. ""I'm acutely aware of the vulnerability of our position and it's heart breaking news about the film festival,"" she says. ""On the other hand, it's a time when boldness, creativity and imagination are more needed than ever. It's people who get us in and out of every wave and our ability to solve problems, literally imagine our way out.  ""We need to speak to our arts and culture more boldly, own that space more fiercely, and that's speaking on behalf of the full cultural landscape of Scotland. It's something which is a huge responsibility, but we have to rise to the challenge."" Her appointment to the post came as something of a surprise, not just to the cultural sector but to the award-winning violinist herself. ""I remember getting this phone call and thinking I was being asked to recommend someone for the job, and it took me a while to realise they were asking me."" She began to consider what she could bring to the job. Since winning BBC Young Musician of the Year at the age of 16, she has been performing internationally, released 12 albums, won a Grammy award and set up her own foundation to promote music education. And while she had no formal training in arts administration, she realised she had been absorbing it for more than 20 years. ""Very quickly, ideas that were born when I was 16, some when I was 20, some born in Japan, some in Scotland, came to mind,"" she says. ""Whenever I had spoken to audiences, those who run orchestras, or theatres or concert halls, I had been asking questions. It was twenty years of touring the world, asking those questions."" She also acknowledges her parents, Scots Italians, Giovanni and Francesca. Her father is a retired businessman and entrepreneur. ""Having come from a business background with a highly optimistic, sometimes unrealistic, father and a very realistic, sometimes pessimist mother, I'm always looking at what can be done differently or better."" She convinced the board at the Edinburgh International Festival, and in March this year, she was announced as the first woman, and the first Scot, to take up the post. She officially took over from Fergus Linehan (who'd held the post since 2015) at the start of October, but she says work began almost immediately on programmes which can often involve bookings years in advance. She likens her role in the organisation, to that of a performer with an orchestra. It's a team effort, involving many different people. ""One of the biggest challenges for an orchestra to sound great and do justice to the music, is for everyone to understand their strongest function and if you can that, you will perform best. "" ""It's a wonderful way to look at it and for me bringing the public with us on this journey is important, regardless of where you're from or what your experience is."" She's immersed herself in the history of the 75-year event, and of course she's played her own part in the most recent stage, including the 2021 pandemic festival which involved scaled down, outdoor concerts. She says it made her realise the resilience of the festival, and the support it had. ""I just recall looking out into that enormous tent and being overwhelmed with emotion. It was telling to me that I didn't understand how common that emotion was until I started speaking to audiences this year and realised, we all experienced that emotion. That shared emotion is what people do feel, what people want to feel and what we want to feel more of."" Her high profile should help both with audiences, and with funding partners. ""We'll see. I know a lot of people in Scotland. I'm from here. I can speak directly to people. I understand the historic and humble position the festival occupies."" ""It's also not a stretch to me to understand why someone wouldn't feel welcome or understand the arts."" ""I would feel closer to the average person walking into a concert hall, feeling there are things they don't know."" Her youth - she's 35 - may also help the festival attract younger audiences. ""There's an absolute common desire to ask where our future audiences are coming from but it's a total misconception that anywhere at the festival is a closed door. I hope we can make that clear in transparent messaging. I don't need to go through a process of translation, I can speak directly to young people and the festival is committed to that."" She says she would rather prepare new audiences for the traditional elements of a classical performance, than see them changed. ""It's important to maintain the traditional elements of concerts - the hall, the quiet, the attention."" ""There's ways of doing that which is neither patronising a new audience nor diminishing the experience for the existing audience."" ""All the experiences I've had from the stage and from producing events, every minutiae from programmes, to lighting, to tickets, I've had that experience from a number of different angles and I I've also seen what's way over the top and destroys the intimacy and beauty."" ""That collective listening experience is a wonderful thing and something you don't get a lot of, out there in the chaos of the world so it's a careful balancing act to protect it, and make sure it's open to everyone."" Balance seems like the perfect word for a violinist, adding a new string to her bow. But how much of the musician will we hear at future festivals? ""It's something we will consider year by year but I'm going to be playing,"" she says. ""I feel it would be mean and not wise to say I'm taking over this role but you're never going to hear me play."" ""I will definitely be playing. It's just a case of what and when."""

But what is it for? When is it? Is it a celebration or a protest? And is there an equivalent International Men's Day?  For more than a century people around the world have been marking 8 March as a special day for women. Read on to find out why. International Women's Day grew out of the labour movement to become a UN-recognised annual event.  The seeds of it were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. It was the Socialist Party of America who declared the first National Woman's Day, a year later. The idea to make the day international came from a woman called Clara Zetkin. She suggested the idea in 1910 at an International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen. There were 100 women there, from 17 countries, and they agreed on her suggestion unanimously.   It was first celebrated in 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The centenary was celebrated in 2011, so this year we're technically celebrating the 109th International Women's Day.  Things were made official in 1975 when the United Nations (UN) started celebrating the day. The first theme adopted by the UN (in 1996) was ""Celebrating the past, Planning for the Future"". This year's focuses on ""An equal world is an enabled world"" and asks for people to work together to create a gender equal world. International Women's Day has become a date to celebrate how far women have come in society, in politics and in economics, while the political roots of the day mean strikes and protests are organised to raise awareness of continued inequality.  8 March. Clara's idea for an International Women's Day had no fixed date. It wasn't formalised until a war-time strike in 1917 when Russian women demanded ""bread and peace"" - and four days into the women's strike the Tsar was forced to abdicate and the provisional government granted women the right to vote. The date when the women's strike commenced on the Julian calendar, which was then in use in Russia, was Sunday 23 February. This day in the Gregorian calendar was 8 March - and that's when it's celebrated today. There is indeed, on 19 November. But it has only been marked since the 1990s and isn't recognised by the UN. People celebrate it in more than 60 countries, including the UK. The objectives of the day are ""to focus attention on men's and boys' health, improve gender relations, promote gender equality and highlight positive male role models"". The theme for 2019 was ""Making a difference for men and boys"".  International Women's Day is a national holiday in many countries, including Russia where the sales of flowers doubles during the three or four days around 8 March.  In China, many women are given a half-day off work on 8 March, as advised by the State Council, although many employers don't always pass the half-day on to their female employees.  In Italy, International Women's Day, or la Festa della Donna, is celebrated by the giving of mimosa blossom. The origin of this tradition is unclear but it is believed to have started in Rome after World War Two.  In the US, the month of March is Women's History Month. A presidential proclamation issued every year honours the achievements of American women. This year's International Women's Day campaign has chosen the theme #EachForEqual, which is drawn from the idea of collective individualism. ""We are all parts of a whole,"" the campaign states. ""Our individual actions, conversations, behaviours and mindsets can have an impact on our larger society. ""Collectively, we can make change happen. Collectively, we can each help to create a gender equal world."" The past few years have seen the women's movement reach an unprecedented scale. In October 2017, millions began using the hashtag #MeToo on social media to speak out against experiences of harassment and sexual assault, and to denounce their widespread prevalence.  In 2018, the #MeToo conversation grew to a global scale, with countries such as India, France, China, and South Korea joining in the conversation to demand change. In the US, a record number of women were elected in the midterm elections.  Last year saw abortion decriminalised in Northern Ireland and the repeal of a law that controlled how women acted and dressed in public in Sudan.

Temperatures are soaring in many cities, including the capital Delhi, but that didn't stop people from gathering outdoors and stretching and bending their way through at least an hour of yoga.  And the event attracted all kinds of participants - even the dog unit of the Indian army! The Indo-Tibetan border police - and their dogs and horses - were not about to be outdone. They practised what they called yoga, doga and hoga. And they were luckier than many of their counterparts - they got to practise their yoga in cooler climes, along India's scenic Himalayan border.  Among those who did yoga in a more challenging climate were the armed forces on board the naval aircraft carrier INS Viraat which is docked off the coastline of sweltering Mumbai city.  In Gujarat, the soldiers got a little more creative with their yoga.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is known to be a yoga enthusiast, also practiced along with a crowd of some 40,000 people in Jharkhand state.  ""We should make efforts to take yoga from cities to villages and tribal areas. Yoga is above religion, caste, colour, gender and region - it is above everything,"" Mr Modi said at the main event, which kicked off celebrations.  The Indian prime minister was spotted doing stretches, bends and breathing exercises in Ranchi, the state's capital city.  Some practitioners took part in a yoga session at the 15th Century Adalaj stepwell in the western state of Gujarat. Here, people practised yoga in Jammu, in the disputed Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir. At the other end of the sub-continent, in Tamil Nadu, large numbers turned out to mark  the day on a beach in the state capital Chennai.  Tens of thousands of people took part in cities and towns all over India. ."

The Long Course Weekend next September will see about 3,000 competitors run, cycle and swim across Nidderdale, North Yorkshire Council said. The event, being held in England for the first time, is expected to boost the local economy by up to £2m. The triathlon event was established in Wales in 2010, and now has competitions taking place across the globe. The Long Course Weekend's founder, Matthew Evans, said he had wanted to bring the race to England ""for a long time now"". North Yorkshire was the ""perfect location"" as the county had a ""proven track record of staging major sporting events, such as the Tour de France's Grand Départ"", he said. The weekend would be based on the principles of the triathlon, but would be ""tailored to open up the three disciplines of swimming, cycling and running to as wide an audience as possible"", he added. Councillor Derek Bastiman, from North Yorkshire Council, said to host such a ""well-respected and internationally renowned sporting event is a real coup for us"", with events also taking place next year in New Zealand, Belgium and Mallorca. He said the race was a popular date in the sporting calendar in countries ""across the world"" and would be ""a privilege"" for North Yorkshire to host in ""what is one of the most beautiful and diverse parts of the country"". Organisers said the weekend was one of only a few events which brought together swimmers, cyclists, runners and triathletes of all abilities over one weekend. They said competitors would have the choice to participate in one of the individual disciplines or could choose to take part in all three stages. The swim distances would range from 1.2 miles to 2.4 miles, (1.9km to 3.8km), cycling routes would be from 56 miles to 112 miles (56km to 180km), with runs ranging from three miles (5km) to a full marathon, organisers added. There was also expected to be a children's running event ""to encourage all members of the family to get involved"". Emma Robinson, a triathlete from Harrogate who has competed for Great Britain, said: ""As a triathlete I will probably take part in all three, but it's great that others can choose to just take part in the swim, the cycle or the run. ""I think it's great to have such an inclusive event coming to North Yorkshire."" The exact course for the race, which will be centred around Pateley Bridge, was still to be decided, but the event would take place from 6-8 September, the council said.

In a letter to the head of Christ Church CofE Primary School in Clifton, Bristol, parents raised concerns over teacher interaction since lockdown. The letter said the school should look to ""improve its current provision"".  However, head teacher Clare Jones said teachers had been ""readily communicating with families"".

The letter, signed by 22 parents, said Bristol City Council's guidance advised parents to keep in regular touch with schools.  But the parents said the school had informed them that it would ""only be responding to critical information not unnecessary questions/comments"" and teachers would ""not enter into a dialogue about home learning via the school email"". ""It's becoming upsetting for my children to have to listen to all the innovative ways of home-schooling other schools have come up with,"" said parent Jenny Shah.  ""Surely at least a phone call would have been possible?""  Another parent, Dr Leila Walker, said: ""For the mental health and safeguarding of children, most schools have used a simple weekly or even fortnightly check-in with tutors.  ""If Christ Church had adopted this approach it would have gone a long way in helping families feel connected and to help kids feel motivated.""

Prices for internal mail are staying the same, but Jersey Post said from 1 April the price of a letter to the UK would rise from 70p to 74p. A letter to continental Europe would rise from 84p to £1 and a letter to the rest of the world from £1.05 to £1.30. Jersey Post said declining volumes, losses on UK post and the ""significant cost"" of flying mail led to the rises. The service also explained ""recent pressures on businesses locally"" and changes to UK regulation allowing postal services to increase charges for handling mail contributed to its decision.  A spokeswoman said: ""Jersey Post has made every effort to absorb as much of the rise in international charges as possible, but due to the considerable increase this year, it must unfortunately pass some of the costs onto its customers.""

The creatures, along with other equipment for experiments, will head to the ISS aboard Space X's Falcon 9 rocket.  Its hoped that the experiments will be able to help scientists understand the effects of spaceflight.  The launch at 13:29 EDT (17:29 GMT) will be broadcast live by Nasa.  The 128 baby bobtail squid will be used as part of research into the effects of spaceflight on beneficial interactions between microbes and animals.  The squid have an immune system which is similar to that of humans. Nasa says the experiment could support the development of protective measures to preserve astronaut health during long space missions. ""Animals, including humans, rely on our microbes to maintain a healthy digestive and immune system. We do not fully understand how spaceflight alters these beneficial interactions,"" Jamie Foster, the experiment's principal investigator said.  She added that the squid will be able to address ""these important issues in animal health"".  The squid will be frozen before their return to Earth.  They are also joined on the Space X rocket by 5,000 tardigrades, more commonly referred to as water bears. The microscopic animals can tolerate environments more extreme than most life forms can. This makes them perfect for studying how life responds and adapts to extreme environments.  It is hoped that this information can then be used to understand the stress factors affecting humans in space.  ""One of the things we are really keen to do is understand how tardigrades are surviving and reproducing in these environments and whether we can learn anything about the tricks that they are using and adapt them to safeguard astronauts,"" Thomas Boothby, the experiment's principal investigator said.  Other experiments due to be conducted include a look into whether robotic arms can be operated remotely using virtual reality along with a study into the production of tougher cotton.  "

Cumbria Tourism said only one per cent of visitors were from abroad in 2022, down from 15% in 2019. Gill Haigh, managing director at Cumbria Tourism, blamed rising living costs and a reluctance to travel in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.  However, she said the county was attracting more younger visitors.  In total, 65% of visitors to Cumbria this year were aged between 25 and 59, up from 45% in 2018. Ms Haigh said Cumbria Tourism had been touring schools and colleges to try and get younger people, or those wanting a job change, to consider the hospitality industry. She said: ""It's been a year of ups and downs but on the whole a positive one. ""We've been trying to get the message across that tourism and hospitality are fantastic industries. ""They are often characterised as low skilled and low paid, but I think that those looking at these careers would be surprised by the salaries they can attract.  ""There are also tremendous opportunities for career progression."" The sector is usually worth £3bn a year to the local economy, but figures released in January 2021 showed coronavirus had led to losses of about £2bn. The effects of coronavirus on visitor numbers to the national park had previously been described as ""equivalent to three winter seasons in a row"". Ms Haigh said businesses were rising to the challenge of coping with less resources by, for example, reducing their menu options and changing opening times.  ""Businesses are looking to innovate, but we must make sure that the customer experience isn't damaged.  ""We've just done a visitor face-to-face survey and satisfaction rates, including value for money remain really high, which is very positive,"" she added.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51136829","Oscars 2020: The lowdown on international film nominees",2020-02-04,"Vincent Dowd","Arts correspondent, BBC News","The Academy Awards have a new category this year - in name at least.   There has been an Oscar for best foreign language film since 1947, although the title could vary in the early years. But when two years ago producers Larry Karaszewski and Diane Weyermann took over running the category it didn't take long to decide the old title should go.     Karaszewski said last year: ""The word 'foreign' was starting to seem strange, because there was really nothing foreign about the movies that we were seeing. They were just not in the English language."" So now Academy members are voting to choose the best international feature film.  The submission rules remain unchanged - one film per country with limited amounts of English dialogue.  But the voting procedure has always been more complex than for most categories and more differences have been instigated.   The most significant is that shortlisted films can be watched online. This allows more Academy members to participate in the voting process.   More than 90 films submitted have come down to a final five. Here we give an overview of each.  Country: Poland Language: Polish Poland's track record in this category: Eleven previous nominations including one win. Director: Jan Komasa What's it about?: Daniel is a young man living in a tough juvenile detention centre where violence is common. He's allowed out to travel to a village in the countryside to work in a sawmill. The village priest comes to assume Daniel has just left a Catholic seminary and appoints him his unofficial stand-in while he goes away.  It could all be the set-up to a comedy of mistaken identity - and there is humour in the film. But Daniel (played by Bartosz Bielenia) offers the villagers the emotional consolation they needed after a recent tragedy but which never materialised. They accept and perhaps even love him (though some of them may suspect he's not what he claims to be). The violent Daniel blossoms into something far better but then reality lunges into view.          Chances of winning: At the film's centre is a remarkable performance by Bartosz Bielenia, working with a strong screenplay based loosely on real events. Bielenia shows Daniel's hardened viciousness but slowly allows the audience to sense goodness growing inside him - perhaps even a soul. A man devoid of morality becomes the most moral person in the film. It's hard not to care about his fate, though the audience guesses his pretence will be discovered eventually. Though it's not likely to win, the careers of Bielenia and director Komasa will benefit.             Country: North Macedonia Language: Turkish and Macedonian North Macedonia's track record in this category: One nomination, as Macedonia, in 1994  Directors: Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov What's it about?:  It's a documentary, focusing on the tough lives of Hatidze Muratova (who's in her 50s) and her mother Nafize in countryside a few miles from the capital Skopje.  Hatidze, an absolute gift for any documentary-maker, survives mainly by keeping bees and selling their honey at market. A family moves in nearby: any initial suspicion is soon replaced by warmth as Hatidze accepts them almost as her own. The bees become a joint project. But financial pressures encourage the newly arrived family to over-harvest the honey.  Problems emerge.      Chances of winning: It's rare a documentary gets nominated in this category. (The film is also nominated for best documentary feature.)  It was shot over a period of three years by a small crew: the result was 400 hours of rushes which have been expertly edited down. There are a few moments which feel as if they may have been recreated for the camera but overall it's an insight into a life most audiences will know nothing about. No documentary has yet won in the category but Hatidze's personality alone makes the film worth seeing. The directors have now bought her a new house.               Country: France Language: French France's track record in this category: 40 nominations with 12 wins. (Only Italy has won more often) Director:  Ladj Ly What's it About?: Abandon thoughts of Jean Valjean, Inspector Javert and anthems sung on barricades. The film takes its title from the Victor Hugo novel but it's set in the modern social housing estate of les Bosquets in eastern Paris. (Parts of the book are set around the same area.) Stéphane is a policeman transferred to a unit which patrols the tough neighbourhood by car. Tensions, some racial, simmer with residents. The two officers Stéphane is assigned to - one white, one black - have learnt to cut corners if they see the need. A lion cub is stolen from a circus, which at first seems almost comic. Then a violent incident occurs which the police need to hide. But a complication emerges: the incident was filmed from a drone.            Chances of winning: Director Ladj Ly is from a Malian immigrant family and grew up in the area, where there were big riots in 2005. It's his first feature film and it took the Jury Prize at Cannes last year. Much of the screenplay works well as a police procedural but it's strange that though he digs into the policemen's characters we're left needing to learn more about individuals in the community.  At times plot and characterisations don't convince. Stéphane comes across as improbably naive about colleagues' attitudes to policing a tough beat and the background of day-to-day life for the mainly African families barely registers. There's ample tension in the first half but as mayhem kicks off the story loses some of its grip.                  Country: Spain Language: Spanish Spain's track record in this category: 19 nominations, including four wins Director: Pedro Almodovar What's it about?: Salvador Mallo (played by Antonio Banderas) is a respected Spanish film-maker who's financially well-off but beginning to feel his age - it's not clear he will ever make another film. His health is failing and he is increasingly prone to depression and dependence on drugs. In extended flashbacks to childhood we see his love for his mother (played by Penelope Cruz), the first stirrings of gay sexuality and the sparky intelligence which set him apart as a boy. Struggling to rediscover a creative path, Mallo goes to visit the star of an early hit with whom he fell out many years ago.   Chances of winning: Almodovar (now 70) has been nominated twice before in this category and won in 1999 for All About My Mother. He also took an Oscar for his screenplay for Talk to Her so he's a known quantity with Oscar voters. Almodovar insists Pain and Glory isn't explicitly autobiographical but there are clear parallels with his own life. The film's attractively shot and designed and the performances are excellent. The story's quieter and more considered than many of his early works though sometimes it feels the director is revisiting old ground. But if there's one thing Academy members love it's a screen full of good-looking people lamenting how tough it is to be a film-maker.    Country: South Korea Language: Korean with a little English South Korea's track record in this category:  It's the first South Korean film nominated in this category Director: Bong Joon Ho  What's it about?:  The film is a dark and intricately worked out farce with a strong streak of class-based satire (and with more violence than farce normally involves). The Kim family lives in a crowded ""semi-basement"" where they just about get by financially. A friend suggests the son could make cash filling in for him as tutor to a wealthy but wildly dysfunctional family. One-by-one the existing domestic staff disappear as he schemes to get his entire family employed. The Kims seem secure financially at last. Of course fate has other ideas.         Chances of winning: Parasite took the Palme d'Or at Cannes last year and has just won best film not in the English language at this year's Baftas. There are many Hollywood executives who since then have wished they'd come up with the story, thrown it to a US writer and sat back to await the Oscar plaudits. As well as best international film it's nominated for best picture, best director, best screenplay, best editing and best production design. It's worth buying a ticket just to ogle the gorgeous house for a couple of hours (it was built especially on a movie lot). Many see the film as the most predictable of shoo-ins at this year's Oscars. Some Academy members may feel it's wasteful to hand the award to a film likely to win in other categories... though last year Roma took best foreign language film despite having nine other nominations.   If Parasite does win, and after Alfonso Cuaron's success last time, does that suggest this category is undergoing a fundamental shift toward the mainstream? Is the era over when an accomplished but little-noticed film could come from nowhere to take this Oscar?    Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-51325491","Six Nations: The Wales rugby international 'shot by a poison arrow'",2020-01-31,"Amanda Cashmore","BBC News","""I could tell immediately that he was going to be a fascinating story."" In 1908, Norman Biggs was reported to have been shot by a poison arrow while in northern Nigeria working as a district superintendent. But Biggs was not from Nigeria, he was born in Cardiff and was Wales' youngest rugby international, said local historian Ted Richards. He explained that Biggs first appeared in the newspapers aged about 12, with a story about his rugby talent. He later played for Cardiff aged 16, before joining the Welsh team aged 18. ""That record stood for 120 years,"" said Mr Richards. Mr Richards, a former toxicologist, was researching people killed by poison when he stumbled onto Biggs' story in an old newspaper article. ""The more I researched him and his family, the more interesting the story became,"" he said. Biggs' first international game was against the New Zealand Natives, which later became the All Blacks, in Swansea. ""He had a very bad game - he was 'pooh pooed' the Western Mail said, which is a great expression, because he played for Cardiff,"" said Mr Richards. ""There was this rivalry between Swansea and Cardiff, and there still is."" After becoming injured, he took up running while studying at Cambridge University, where he became an excellent sprinter. In Biggs' obituary, it was said he could run 100 yards (91.4m) in 10 seconds. He later returned to rugby, playing multiple games for Wales and becoming Cardiff's captain in 1893, playing for them until 1899. But in 1900, Biggs decided to fight in the Boer War and joined the Glamorgan Imperial Yeomanry, said Mr Richards, travelling to South Africa. He was injured and shipped home for treatment. ""The reports of that… you pick up a bit of Norman's maybe impetuous type of behaviour,"" said Mr Richards. Biggs returned to South Africa as a captain for a different unit and returned home in 1902. Mr Richards said newspapers reported Biggs later travelled to Nigeria in 1907, and was a district superintendent. But in 1908, in response to local pilfering, he was sent to help calm things down. ""There was a skirmish and a number of Nigerians were shot,"" explained Mr Richards. ""Norman, if we are to believe the newspaper reports, went off to the neighbouring village to warn them. ""But the people he went to warn misunderstood him, and they attacked him with this poison arrow."" Mr Richards said that although he does believe Mr Biggs was shot by a poison arrow in northern Nigeria, he does not think it is what killed him. ""I think a poison like that works pretty fast; now the newspaper reports said he didn't die for four days,"" he explained. ""It was probably a haemorrhage that didn't heal or something like that."" Mr Richards said that in Nigeria, poison could be taken from a vine that used to grow on the outside of a tree. The fruit would be picked, dried and used as poison, he explained. It affected the enzyme that transports sodium and potassium out of the cell, influencing the muscles and causing the heart to give up, he went on. Mr Richards said newspaper reports claimed Biggs pulled the arrow out his leg and his friend cauterised the wound with a hot knife. A grave for Norman Biggs is still in Nigeria. Despite international rugby not having perhaps the same level of celebrity, Mr Richards said ""the Welsh public had a thirst for this knowledge of what happened to a famous person like Norman"". He said Biggs' letters were published in the Western Mail, Wales' national newspaper. Mr Richards researched Biggs for about a year, through genealogy, newspapers and even speaking to descendents. He said: ""There's a bit about him on the internet. Not a huge amount for someone who's achieved quite a lot sporting wise, I find that quite strange."""

Having struggled financially in the past, this year she received additional funding from Arts Council Northern Ireland and describes her upcoming play as her ""most ambitious"" piece to date. Set in post-conflict Fermanagh, Birds of Passage in the Half Light explores Northern Ireland's connection to the church in 2022. ""It's a cathartic piece for people who have ever felt conflict in their lives, from a religious perspective. We are not great with language in Northern Ireland, but our self-deprecating sense of humour is how we remain positive,"" she said. ""We deal with it in comedy, that's a universal concept, it helps with dark subject matter."" Rosemary Jenkinson's latest work, Billy Boy, is based off interviews with loyalist bonfire builders in east Belfast. ""Bonfires might be more contentious in Belfast because of our divided society, but bonfires and fire rituals take place as expressions of culture all over the world,"" she told BBC News NI. ""It's so wrong for Northern Irish people to think they are culturally inferior or that they continually need to explain and justify their culture. It's time for us to be proud of both our differences and similarities with the rest of the world."" The playwright said that many have experienced ""cultural starvation"" since the pandemic, with this year's festival providing a ""strong sense of celebration and relief"".  ""The most badly hit sector in the whole of the arts during lockdown was theatre, as Northern Irish theatres were closed for a year and five months. ""I also think because of the Lisa McGee and Anna Burns effect, everyone working in Northern Irish theatre feels this year that there is a particular appetite for our humour, so it's really important for us to ride that wave at this current moment.  ""I believe the future for Northern Irish work is limitless. However, it's high time that the immense talent from here was properly recognised, supported and exported by Stormont."" Harpist-comedienne Ursula Burns, from Belfast, is travelling to the festival in a modified truck which she intends to use as a venue for her show. Ms Burns knows that Edinburgh ""can be really tough"", but already she feels like the 2022 line-up offers a ""support that just wasn't there any other years"". ""There's a vibe, I've already picked up on a buzz, the fact that other [Northern Irish acts] have reached out to me - it's like a breath of fresh air,"" she said. Ms Burns, like many others, is excited to make her Edinburgh festival return following the pandemic. ""Last year was very scaled back, there was all the testing and masks, that's like a real buzz kill, singing wearing a mask, didn't appeal to me, I wasn't ready, I wasn't interested,"" she said. ""I was used to the adrenaline, creating content and keeping things going and to just go to nothing - it hit me very hard. Everybody's gone through it, it's like a collective trauma."" Fermanagh-born Joyce Greenaway is returning to this year's festival with Whisk(e)y Wars, her play about an Ulster woman who is attempting to create the perfect single malt in an effort to save her family's distillery.  Joyce made her Edinburgh debut with the one-woman-show at 2021's downsized event and describes this year as being ""totally different"". ""There's a buzz as there's way more artists performing and so much generosity and a definite sense of community,"" she said. The performer described the acts from Northern Ireland as ""insanely talented, absolute grafters and natural storytellers who often hide their lights under bushels but are the equal of any"".   ""We're great storytellers, with dry wit and raw emotion and we totally deal in dysfunction, which always connects. ""I also love that our shows are now a 'thing', a sort of known brand, and known for quality work, so I'm loving being part of this creative surge to Edinburgh Fringe which is well overdue"", she added, As the festival kicked off, Shona McCarthy told BBC News NI that it highlighted a ""great growth"" in Northern Ireland representation at the festival and described the year's line-up as ""super exciting"". ""I think there is a growing acceptance of voices that aren't all kind of monotonal and sound the same.  ""I can't wait to hear all the flat vowels, all those local voices and see Northern Ireland yet again punch well above its weight in what is 3,300 shows we have."""

The 10-year agreement will see the HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales undergo dry-dock maintenance at the Babcock's facilities in Fife.  Both vessels were assembled at the yard.  The same yard won the contract to carry out the first dry-dock maintenance of HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2019.  The UK government said the latest contract would help sustain 300 jobs at the yard and the wider supply chain.  Jeremy Quin, defence procurement minister, said: ""The Queen Elizabeth class carriers are the flagships of our Royal Navy and it's crucial they remain ready to protect and defend the UK and our allies. ""Both carriers had their final construction in Rosyth, and I'm pleased they will return for their dry-dock maintenance, supporting vital jobs and skills in Scotland."" The 65,000-tonne carriers cost taxpayers £3bn each and are used to launch the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fast jets across the globe. HMS Prince of Wales recently supported Exercise Cold Response - the largest Arctic exercise in 30 years, which saw 2,000 British personnel join 26 other nations off the shores of Norway - while her sister ship HMS Queen Elizabeth has been carrying out training in waters close to the UK. Sean Donaldson, Babcock's managing director of marine engineering and systems at the Rosyth site, said the yard was ideally placed to complete projects of this scale.  ""The programme will also benefit from the extensive knowledge and expertise of Babcock's skilled workforce which is steeped in carrier experience. It's a really proud moment for us,"" he said.  The UK government said the contract was awarded by Defence Equipment & Support through a robust and transparent competition, encouraging strong bids from viable dockyards."

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/47747129",NA,NA,NA,NA,"How many people can say they got their first international call-up at the age of 49? And of those - if there are any - how many can say they were spotted while playing a match on billionaire businessman Sir Richard Branson's Caribbean holiday island of Mosquito? Martin Smith, a plumber from Ipswich, is the only one.  After playing in that charity game, he was thrust into the British Virgin Islands (BVI) squad for their Concacaf Nations League qualifiers against Bonaire and the Turks and Caicos Islands last month in Anguilla.  Selected as reserve goalkeeper in those games he is yet to win a cap, but if he did it would make him the second-oldest international player in the world. ""I enjoyed playing but hadn't played for 15 or 20 years,"" Smith told BBC Sport. ""There were players there that played for the BVI national team and a week before this first game in Anguilla I had a call from the head coach. ""One of the English-based goalkeepers that flies in to play for the BVI had broken his shoulder and he asked if I would be interested in being back-up goalkeeper and maybe do a bit of coaching. ""It took me all of about 12 seconds to say yes,"" added Smith, who played at a decent standard of non-league football in his native Suffolk. The British Virgin Islands is a British Overseas Territory, so people living there are classed as British citizens and anyone with a British passport is eligible to play for them - provided they meet residency requirements. Life away from the UK has always appealed to Smith - he worked as a holiday rep in places such as Tenerife and Majorca, and did ski seasons in France and the USA. He moved to the Bahamas to work with his cousin five years ago, before getting a job a couple of years later as the plumbing supervisor on Branson's exclusive island where even former US president Barack Obama has spent time on holiday. ""I'm still pinching myself now that I was involved with an international football squad,"" he says. ""The week in Anguilla was an eye-opener. We were getting police escorts to the games, we had stands full of people, and I had friends back in the UK who were watching it being live streamed.  ""It was quite bizarre when we played the Turks and Caicos because we sung our national anthem, God Save the Queen, then they sung theirs and it was God Save the Queen as well!"" If Smith were to play, only former World Player of the Year George Weah would be an older full international - he played against Nigeria last September aged 51 years and 345 days. Smith said his first day's training with the BVI squad was an eye-opener as he chased men more than two decades his junior along the Caribbean sands. ""They say goalkeepers don't have to be fit, and that was a lucky thing because after I tried to keep up with these guys on the beach for the first day, the next day was quite a painful 24 hours for me,"" he joked. But that has not stopped Smith eyeing up a chance to stay involved in some capacity when they face Bonaire and the Bahamas in Group C of the third tier of the Concacaf Nations League starting in September. ""They're very winnable games,"" he says. ""If the other young goalkeeper's shoulder is repaired I'll be seeing if they wouldn't mind me still being the international goalkeeper coach and be back-up."""

But Socceroos coach Graham Arnold says the playmaker ""believes he will be ready to go"". ""[Huddersfield] ruled him out before we could speak to him,"" said Arnold. ""He's asked for the medical staff to go over and to have a look at him and we just want what's best for the kid.  ""The kid wants to go to the Asian Cup and the kid wants to play for Huddersfield."" Arnold confirmed that Australia's physio Phil Coles was heading to England, with other Socceroos' medical staff, to give the midfielder another assessment on Friday. Huddersfield manager David Wagner responded to Mooy's call-up by saying the Terriers will have to ""respect Aaron and his long-term career"", adding: ""We think he'll be out for eight weeks."" He told Sky Sports: ""Australia have asked for a second opinion, which we absolutely respect, but we will rush nothing, no-one wants him to have further injuries."" A final decision on Mooy's participation is expected to be made over the weekend.

"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/52480495",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Coronavirus could impact on the international football calendar for ""two or three years"", says a member of Uefa's executive committee. Lars-Christer Olsson, president of European Leagues, said that it would be a case of ""wait and see"" to assess the disruption of the pandemic, including on the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Uefa hopes to complete the Champions League and Europa League in August. A decision is set to be made at the end of May around whether this is feasible. There are also plans to fit three - rather than two - fixtures into international windows this autumn to play Euro 2020 qualifiers and Nations League fixtures. Uncertainty over domestic cups, says Man Utd chief Woodward Olsson said that he would ""rather see a scenario where the current season is not finished than not kicking off the new season"". Following the widespread suspension of football and the postponement of Euro 2020 and Euro 2021, he was asked on a Soccerex webinar how long he thought that the international calendar could be affected. ""Probably two or three years I think,"" he said. Earlier, he had told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast that there was ""no consensus"" between countries regarding finishing the domestic season, as each country faces different situations regarding the virus and government decisions. France's top two divisions, Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, will not resume this season after France banned all sporting events, including those behind closed doors, until September. The Dutch top flight was abandoned last week with no promotion or relegation and no champions. Asked how Uefa would claim to have a satisfactory conclusion to their competitions if competing clubs, such as PSG and Ajax, have not played football for many months, he said: ""It's difficult to say but in any case, it's a extraordinary situation we are in and there have to be extraordinary solutions."" Speaking on the webinar, he said: ""For the time being we are planning, trying to squeeze in the rest of the season 2019-20 in the month of August. ""If that would be possible, then I think it would be fine because that would also mean that we can safeguard the integrity of the final phase of the current season of international football.  ""But of course we have to take decisions about that at the end of May at least because otherwise it will probably not be possible to squeeze it in and also to qualify the clubs for the new season."" With the World Cup less than three years away, Olsson was asked if that could be affected. ""If the virus is developing in an even more serious way as it has been for the time being there will definitely be a problem with the international calendar,"" he said. ""When some of the competitions are moved from one year to another. And then the Qatar World Cup is coming in the middle of the European season and you have to squeeze in domestic and international competitions. But I think we have to wait and see how that is going to affect the business."""
"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/49823746",NA,NA,NA,NA,"After 22 years in first-class cricket, you might think that thoughts would begin to turn to retirement - unless your name is Darren Stevens. ""I've got no intention of finishing playing anytime soon,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I haven't once considered it, I think I just love the game too much. ""I've still got a lot to give, a drive and desire to do well, to score runs and take wickets and win games of cricket. ""I want to win games for Kent, so why give it up? Over the past few weeks, I've shown I can do that."" At 43, the Kent all-rounder will remain part of county cricket's furniture into 2020 after agreeing a one-year contract extension. But in July, Kent revealed they would not be offering the right-hander a new deal after 15 years and Stevens had already begun a loan move to Derbyshire during the T20 Blast. His future looked set to be back in the East Midlands, but not before he would give Kent supporters what appeared to be one last memorable performance. He smashed a career-best 237 against Yorkshire and finished the same match earlier this month at Headingley with figures of 7-70. A few days later, terms had been agreed to keep him at Kent. ""For the last six years really, we've been having the conversations about how things are going and doing another year in June/July time,"" Stevens said. ""Originally this season, it went the other way and the club were thinking of moving in an opposite direction. I hadn't got off to the greatest of starts this season and I understood that decision. ""But the way I finished this season, I didn't see any need to retire."" Stevens made his first-class debut back in 1997 for Leicestershire, the same season former England captain Graham Gooch called time on his career, aged 44. With Somerset and England batsman Marcus Trescothick bowing out this season at 43, Stevens will be county cricket's stand-out stalwart in 2020 and turns 44 in April. What's more, he could find himself lining-up in cricket's newest format next summer, The Hundred. ""I've just put my name in for that and completed the forms,"" he joked. ""I thought 'why not?' ""I've got the experience and played the game. While it's a bit different to T20, it's exciting. T20 took off and what's to say that The Hundred won't do the same?""  Should he be picked in October's draft, Stevens will be able to add a new column to his impressive career stats. Before this week's County Championship match against Hampshire, his tally stood at 15,616 runs and 515 wickets in first-class cricket."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55897836","Military coup likely to damage Myanmar's economy",2021-02-02,NA,NA,"Businesses and analysts predict that the coup in Myanmar is likely to damage the country's economy.  Companies say the coup has already put billions worth of foreign investment at risk.  The US has already said it is considering imposing additional sanctions on Myanmar, which is one of the region's poorest countries. However, the impact of US sanctions could be limited because most of the country's investment comes from Asia.  According to the World Bank, Singapore was the largest foreign investor in Myanmar last year, accounting for 34% of overall approved investment. Hong Kong was the second largest investor with 26%.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) commitments into Myanmar were worth $5.5bn (£4bn) in the 2020 fiscal year, which ended in September.  Real estate and manufacturing each accounted for about 20% of that figure.  These figures were already expected to be significantly lower this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Vriens & Partners is a government affairs consultancy that is currently handling $3bn-$4bn worth of projects for foreign clients investing in Myanmar.  The projects are mainly for energy, infrastructure and telecommunications.  ""That's all at risk now,"" said the firm's managing partner Hans Vriens.  ""This country has already been badly hit by Covid and by diminishing appetite to invest. And now we have this on top."" Sanctions could have a significant effect on foreign investment, with both Western and Japanese companies thinking twice about projects in Myanmar.  With the US already considering sanctions against Myanmar, Mr Vriens thinks businesses might turn to China instead.  ""It's really the only country they can turn to,"" he said.  One Yangon-based businessman, who asked not to be named, said he's relieved that the coup so far appears to be have been relatively peaceful.   ""So far it's peaceful, without protests, but emotions are strong and people are upset,"" he said.  He said it's likely to have an impact on the economy, but the effect of any western sanctions will depend on whether they're broad or they target the coup leaders.  The effect of sanctions could be limited, however, because the bulk of foreign investment comes from Asia.  ""It will have a psychological impact, but the actual dollar figure coming in, we were never reliant on western investment,"" he said.  He said engagement is a better approach than sanctions, which punish responsible companies. ""You have responsible companies that are adhering to European or US standards who are ironically most affected by sanctions,"" he said.   Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said many of the trade group's members did business in Myanmar and found the coup deeply concerning. ""Our hearts and prayers are with the Myanmar people for a swift, peaceful, and democratic resolution to this crisis - one that does not take away the economic progress made by the hardworking people of Myanmar,"" he said.  A spokesperson for H&M said the company was monitoring events and was in close contact with suppliers, but had no immediate plans to change its sourcing strategy.  ""We are closely following the developments, but refrain from speculating about what this will mean for us going forward,"" the official said. The coup has already had an effect for one listed company.  Myanmar-focused Yoma Strategic Holdings issued a trading halt in Singapore, where the company is listed.  Yoma has interests in real estate, food and beverage, automotive and financial services in Myanmar.   The company's chief executive Melvyn Pun said a lack of information from Myanmar made the trading halt necessary.   ""It was difficult to tell what was going on. There were no telecoms in or out of Yangon [on Monday morning],"" he said.   Australian oil and gas firm Woodside Energy has drilling activities in Myanmar and says its ""highest priority remains the safety of our people, their families and contractors."" ""Noting our current 2021 drilling campaign, we are working with our stakeholders to understand how these planned activities may possibly be impacted and preparing our forward plan,"" a Woodside Energy spokesman told the BBC. The World Bank's most recent figures suggest that the economy will grow at a sluggish 2% this fiscal year, while poverty rates are expected to increase from 22.4% at the end of 2019 to 27%.  Anwita Basu from financial data firm Fitch Solutions told the BBC's Asia Business Report that prior to the coup, strong growth of 6% was expected for the next financial year. Now Fitch expects that growth will be cut in half.  She said it's not yet clear if the coup will have a significant effect on foreign investment.  ""The biggest investors that will be impacted by this will be Asian investors, and therefore you have seen a very tentative reaction from a lot of these countries,"" Ms Basu said.  For China it is an ""uncomfortable situation"", she said, because even though its Belt and Road initiative investments are fairly modest in Myanmar, China has become nervous about countries where there's political uncertainty.

The airport said it was an accident which it ""worked hard to put right"". The council investigation found that during the 2022 summer season there were 3,667 night-time movements, exceeding the cap imposed by 747. It said the airport broke rules set out in the 2007 planning consent, and its night flights would now be monitored each month.

Councillor Helen Hayden, Leeds City Council's executive member for sustainable development and infrastructure, said: ""We will continue to monitor the situation and if required the council has many further options it can pursue including, but not limited to, an enforcement notice. ""It is also important to note that a breach of condition notice offers the most expedient response to resolve this issue for the people of Leeds, with no right of appeal from Leeds Bradford Airport. ""If the breach of condition notice is not complied with this can escalate into summary prosecution that can be brought in the magistrates' court for the offence of contravening a breach of condition notice."" Chris Foren, chair of GALBA, said: ""Last year, we told the council that we believed there had been over 600 more flights than allowed at night from LBA during the 2022 summer season. It turns out there were actually 747 over the limit. ""We're pleased that the council has accepted our complaint and is taking enforcement action.  ""Sadly, the council has no power to impose a fine but the breach of condition notice is important. It should mean the airport doesn't break the night flight rules again this summer - that's good news for local people and for the environment.""

One young Omagh man took matters into his own hands when he became concerned about his own wellbeing.   The result is The Happiness Scrapbook.   Mark Quinn was an outgoing teenager, passionate about films and meeting people.   But as a student, he started to become aware of the impact of social media, especially its effect on his own confidence.   ""Having studied Digital Media Communication, I have seen first hand the many wonderful things social media can do for businesses and people,"" he said.   ""However, I also found it to be one of the most negative impacts on mental health - particularly for people my age and in the current seemingly endless cycle of bad news in the media.""   To try to combat the negativity, he decided to take a lifelong hobby and use it to create a welcoming online environment open to all.   ""All my life I've been taking photos and for the past eight years I've spent a lot of time making very old-fashioned scrapbooks filled with photos, tickets, birthday cards, letters - even receipts!  ""Anything that is important to me I keep and file it in one of my many scrapbooks. It gives me such joy to look back on these.  ""One day I just thought - maybe I could create a virtual scrapbook that everyone could share in?"" And so the Happiness Scrapbook was born.   Mark's first subject was a man who had inspired him throughout his life - his grandfather.   He provided more than 10 minutes in response to the only question Mark asks any of his subjects: ""What makes you happy?"" ""I've got quotes and photos from friends, family, strangers and people others have recommended as 'having something to say,'"" said Mark.   ""I brought my camera with me as I travelled across America during the summer and got amazing answers from coast to coast.   ""The response from people has been amazing."" He now hopes to catalogue ""happiness scraps"" from every county in Ireland and is launching a website with his snaps and the words of the people he has photographed.   There are also other plans for the project.   ""I've also started using the recordings from my American series to create short films entitled 'The Pursuit of Happiness,' said Mark. ""It's amazing how alive the words become once you actually hear what these people are saying and the ways in which they say it.

The prime minister has announced MP Helen Grant as a special envoy for efforts to support girls' education. It is expected to be a key theme of the UK's presidency this year of the G7 group of major industrial countries. ""It can change the fortunes of not just individual women and girls, but communities and nations,"" says the PM. Even before the pandemic, millions of children in developing countries did not have any access to school - and girls from disadvantaged families are particularly vulnerable to missing out on education. whether through poverty or prejudice. The Covid pandemic has created even more barriers to education, with a peak of 1.6 billion children around the world having faced school closures. Mr Johnson, as foreign secretary and prime minister, has previously highlighted girls' education as a key to improving the health, wealth and security of the poorest countries. He once described it as the ""Swiss army knife"" of development, as getting girls to stay in education could avoid early marriage, improve their chances of getting a job and provide more income for children to be better fed. The prime minister said the international target of ensuring all girls can have 12 years of good quality education would be the ""simplest and most transformative thing we can do"" to tackle poverty and to ""end the scourge of gender-based violence"".  ""The benefits of educating girls are enormous - a child whose mother can read is 50% more likely to live past the age of five and twice as likely to attend school themselves. With just one additional school year, a woman's earnings can increase by up to a fifth,"" said Mr Johnson. Helen Grant, now the special envoy for girls' education, said: ""High quality female education empowers women, reduces poverty and unleashes economic growth. ""I will be making it my mission to encourage a more ambitious approach to girls' education from the international community."" There has been a series of pledges from the international community over the past three decades to provide at least a primary school education for all children - all of which have been missed. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said hosting the G7 should be a chance for the UK to act as a ""moral force for good in the world"", but accused the Conservatives of engaging in ""a decade of global retreat"". ""We need to seize this chance to lead again, just as Blair and Brown did over global poverty and the financial crisis."""

They don't get a break any more. They are machines and they break down. ""Someone like Harry Kane, an injury like he has had comes from playing too often, playing Saturday, Tuesday for evermore.

The convention allows Irish, Dutch, French, German and Belgian vessels to fish within six and 12 nautical miles of UK coastline. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the move would help take back control of fishing access to UK waters. The European Commission said it ""took note"" but felt the convention had been superseded by EU law.  Ireland's minister for agriculture, food and the marine, Michael Creed, however, said it was ""unwelcome and unhelpful"". ""Brexit poses very serious challenges to the seafood sector and this announcement will form part of the negotiations,"" he said. The Scottish government backed the idea, saying it had been pressing for it ""for some time"". The London Fisheries Convention sits alongside the EU Common Fisheries Policy, which allows all European Union countries access between 12 and 200 nautical miles of the UK and sets quotas for how much fish nations can catch. The relationship between the UK and Ireland is further governed by a separate arrangement.  Withdrawing from the convention, which was signed in 1964 before the UK joined what became the EU, means UK vessels will also lose the right to fish in waters six to 12 nautical miles offshore of the other countries. What happens to the 12 to 200 mile area will be one of the issues at stake in Brexit negotiations.  Michael Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr the change was about ""taking back control"" of UK waters, 6-12 miles from the coast.  When the UK left the EU it would become an ""independent coastal state"", he said. He said the EU's common fisheries policy had been an environmental disaster and the government wanted to change that, upon Brexit, to ensure sustainable fish stocks in future.  But the SNP's Richard Lochhead, who held the post of fisheries minister in Scotland until last year, has concerns around fishing being used as a ""bargaining chip"" by the government, which would ""let down UK fishermen"".  ""Michael Gove is doing his best to get maximum publicity out of the easy bit,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. ""But the difficult, complex bit is still to come [with] the Common Fisheries Policy. UKIP's fisheries spokesman Mike Hookem also said he feared another ""wholesale betrayal"" without assurances about the 200-mile zone.  ""Fishing communities across Britain voted to leave the EU to get back the rights to earn a living, support their communities and to stop the EU plundering our seas of fish that the UK could exploit economically,"" he said.  He added that the announcement was ""no victory for the fishing community"" and was instead a ""government attempt to use smoke and mirrors to placate British fishermen, while at the same time having the option of handing most our fishing rights to the EU"". Government figures say fishing contributed £604m to UK GDP in 2015 and employed around 12,000 fishers. In 2016, the fish processing industry supported around 18,000 jobs. The industry's body, the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, welcomed the decision. Chief executive Barrie Deas said: ""This is welcome news and an important part of establishing the UK as an independent coastal state with sovereignty over its own exclusive economic zone."" Its chairman Mike Cohen said a 12-mile exclusive zone for UK boats would be ""a good thing"" for the UK's inshore fishing fleet.  Will McCallum, Greenpeace UK head of oceans, said leaving the convention would not in itself deliver a better future for the UK fishing industry, and that for years governments had blamed the EU for their ""failure"" to support the small-scale, sustainable fishers.  He said, for example, that the UK had had the power since 2013 to decide how to allocate its EU fishing quota but that a report by Greenpeace in 2016 had found almost two thirds of that quota was concentrated in the hands of three companies. He said the UK would also still be bound by the UN convention of the law of the seas - which requires cooperation with neighbours. But Mr McCallum said he was ""excited"" that the government was making fishing a priority, after fearing fishing communities would end up ""at the bottom of the heap"" amidst complex Brexit negotiations.  Environmental law firm ClientEarth consultant Dr Tom West said the move appeared to be an aggressive negotiating tactic. ""As a country outside the EU we need to consider how we can best co-operate with our neighbours, rather than unilaterally withdrawing from all agreements in the hope that standing alone will make us better."""

In a televised address, Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""our own behaviour"" was the ""most effective way"" of slowing the rate of infection. The measures included closing hair, beauty and massage studios. Other non-essential shops had already been shut. Shortly afterwards, Mrs Merkel's office said she would quarantine herself. A doctor who vaccinated her on Friday against pneumococcus, a pneumonia-causing bacteria, had tested positive for coronavirus. The chancellor, 65, will be tested regularly in the next few days and work from home, her spokesman said. Germany, Europe's largest economy, has so far confirmed 18,610 cases and 55 deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. People will not be allowed to form groups of three or more in public unless they live together in the same household, or the gathering is work-related. Police will monitor and punish anyone infringing the new rules. Restaurants will now only be allowed to open for takeaway service. All restrictions apply to every German state, and will be in place for at least the next two weeks. ""The great aim is to gain time in the fight against the virus,"" said Mrs Merkel, urging citizens to keep contact outside their own household to an absolute minimum and to ensure a distance of at least 1.5m (5ft) from another person when in public. Italy, the worst-hit European country, reported 651 new deaths on Sunday, bringing the total there to 5,476, according to the government. The figure is the second-worst daily total but less than that announced on the previous day. The number of confirmed cases in the country - where people have been largely confined to their homes for two weeks - has risen from 53,578 to 59,138, the lowest rise in percentage terms since the outbreak began. Earlier, President Sergio Mattarella said he hoped the rest of the world could learn from Italy's troubles. He said citizens across the European Union needed to feel the bloc was taking concrete action to combat the virus. Meanwhile, Spain registered its worst figures so far after 394 people died in a single day, bringing the national total to 1,720. Officials said the number of new daily registered cases, like Italy, had also fallen from Saturday to Sunday. The government is seeking to extend the state of emergency until 11 April, a step that needs to be approved by parliament. The measure introduced on 14 March bars people from all but essential outings. ""We're at war,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said, a day after warning that ""the worst is yet to come"". Also on Sunday, the government announced it would restrict entry at air and sea ports for most foreigners for the next 30 days.  In other developments: In the US, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warned the outbreak would get worse, with damage accelerated by widespread shortages of key medical supplies. Across the country, there are now 31,057 confirmed cases and 390 deaths. According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, more than 310,000 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed around the world, with some 13,000 deaths. More than 93,000 people have recovered."

A report by Police Ombudsman Marie Anderson stated it was ""not intentional and not based on race or ethnicity"". However, confidence in policing among some in minority communities has been ""severely damaged"". Mr Byrne said: ""The time is right to show some humility and say sorry."" Mrs Anderson launched an investigation after complaints about police actions on 6 June, when about 70 fines were handed out at demonstrations in Belfast and Londonderry. In contrast, no £60 fixed penalty notices were issued at a Protect our Monuments rally in Belfast on 13 June - those attending included loyalists and military veterans. Mrs Anderson said police had ""failed to fully understand"" the human rights of those at the Black Lives Matter (BLM) events to be able to protest peacefully. Her report found officers had not engaged in any harassment as some had claimed. ""The differential treatment by PSNI of protesters on 6 June when compared with those attending Protect Our Monuments on 13 June gave rise to claims of unfairness and discrimination against those persons who organised and attended the 'Black Lives Matters' protests,"" the report stated. ""These concerns are in my view cogent, have substance and are justified in the circumstances.   ""I believe that this unfairness was not intentional.  Neither was it based on race or ethnicity of those who attended the event."" On the issue of fines and prosecutions, the ombudsman said they should be reviewed. ""A number of fines issued at the Guildhall Square and Custom House Square have now been paid by the recipients.  ""My investigation has established that many of these contain inconsistencies and errors and therefore their validity is questionable."" Parts of her report echoed one from the Policing Board published in November, which questioned whether the PSNI approach had been unlawful. The PSNI has already announced it is establishing a task force to help rebuild relations with black, Asian and ethnic minority groups. In a statement, Mr Byrne said: ""We tried our best to respect the public health requirements of the Northern Ireland Executive to save lives and at the same time deal with public outcry triggered by this awful death [of George Floyd]. ""We operated within the legal framework available to us at the time, but the ombudsman is clear that whilst unintentional, we got that balance procedurally wrong."" He added: ""It is clear to me that some members of the Black and Minority Ethnic Community have been frustrated, angry and upset by our policing response and our relationship with them has suffered.   ""For that I am sorry, and I am determined in that regard to put things right."" Patrick Corrigan, from Amnesty International, said the report was ""deeply critical"". He called for a ""fundamental reassessment"" of how the PSNI approaches the right to protest and the police's relationship with black and minority ethnic communities."
"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51536246","British radio antenna arrives at space station",2020-02-18,"Jonathan Amos","Science correspondent","The UK's first industrial contribution to the International Space Station (ISS) was delivered on Tuesday.  The communications antenna is part of a consignment of supplies that arrived on a Cygnus freighter.  Made by MDA UK, the Columbus Ka-band (COLKa) Terminal will enable astronauts to connect with scientists and family on Earth at home broadband speeds. The equipment will be fixed to the exterior of Europe's ISS science module in a few weeks' time. This should improve substantially on current arrangements for radio links. ""At the moment, the communications from Columbus go through the American data relay satellites, but those satellites are prioritised for US use. This gives Europe some independence,"" David Kenyon, the managing director of Oxfordshire-based MDA UK, told BBC News. Although Britain was an original signatory to the 1998 treaty that brought the International Space Station into being, the country never got involved in building the platform. Indeed, it pretty much walked away from the project right at the outset, preferring to spend its civil space budget in other areas of space exploration.  It wasn't until 2012 that the UK signalled a reversal in policy by lodging new funds that year at the European Space Agency's (Esa) Ministerial Council meeting in Naples. This money not only paved the way for British astronaut Tim Peake to visit the ISS in 2015/16 but it set in motion the industrial opportunity that's ultimately resulted in the COLKa contribution. The new fridge-sized terminal will route video, voice and data to the ground through satellites that are actually higher in the sky than the ISS.  On occasions, these will continue to be the nodes in the American Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), but the capacity is now there to go through a European alternative as well.  The European Data Relay System (EDRS) only has one satellite operating at the moment but will soon have a second.  This will afford the possibility of tens of minutes of dedicated, high-bandwidth connectivity for the Columbus lab on every 90-minute orbit of the Earth made by the station.  Astronauts are expected to use COLKa to video-call scientists who have experiments running on the ISS, and to make ""welfare"" connections with family and friends on Earth.  Libby Jackson, the human exploration programme manager at the UK Space Agency, said scientists in particular would be delighted with the new connection.  ""The amount of science data that's been able to come down has been quite limited,"" she told BBC News.  ""Scientists have been having to wait months for all their images, all of the science data to arrive on hard disks - never mind 'dial up speeds'. It's sort of like waiting for the old floppy disks to arrive in the post. This is going to really allow those scientists to get the data in real time."" MDA UK assembled the terminal at its facility on the Harwell space campus using components from Italy, Canada, Norway, Belgium, France, and Germany.  Britain lodged further funds at the most recent Esa Ministerial Council in Seville, Spain, so that its home industry could be involved in the construction of the forthcoming lunar space station. Known as the Gateway, this American-led platform will support astronauts on the Moon's surface. The UK is once again seeking a communications role for its companies. An ISS robotic arm captured the Cygnus freighter at 09:05 GMT, prior to the manoeuvre that would pull the vehicle into a berthing position. COLKa will be stored aboard the platform for a few weeks before being bolted to the exterior of Columbus in a spacewalk. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"

"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63757889","Rishi Sunak considers restrictions on foreign students to curb migration",2022-11-25,"Chas Geiger","BBC News","Rishi Sunak is considering curbs on foreign students taking ""low quality"" degrees and bringing dependents, Downing Street said. The PM's spokesman said the idea was being looked at after official figures showed net migration to the UK had climbed to a record half a million.  But they declined to define a ""low quality"" degree or to ""pre-empt"" any policy decisions. A government migration adviser warned it would bankrupt many universities. The Times has reported that plans to bring down numbers could include restricting admissions to top universities, as well as restricting visas for students' dependants.  Home Secretary Suella Braverman has previously complained about foreign students ""bringing in family members who can piggyback onto their student visa"" and ""propping up, frankly, substandard courses in inadequate institutions"".   But moves to reduce foreign student numbers could meet resistance in other parts of Whitehall. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt last week insisted immigration was required to boost growth, adding that there had to be ""a long-term plan if we're going to bring down migration in a way that doesn't harm the economy"".  He said migration would be needed ""for the years ahead - that will be very important for the economy"".  The Department for Education could raise concerns over universities' funding if the number of high fee-paying international students is cut. An adviser on immigration policy has warned some universities could go bankrupt if there is a clampdown on so-called ""low-quality"" degrees.  Chair of the government's Migration Advisory Committee, Professor Brian Bell, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this could ""send many universities over the edge,"" particularly in poorer regions.  He said: ""Most universities for most courses lose money on teaching British students and offset that loss by charging more for international students. ""If you close down the international route I'm not sure how the university continues to survive."" He said London, Cambridge and Oxford would continue to do well but ""what about Newcastle, what about the north-east, the north-west, Scotland?""  He also warned that the policy could result in a ""massive increase"" in British students' fees to make up for the loss of foreign students' payments. The National Union of Students (NUS) said it would be ""laughable"" if the government made it harder for international students to study in the UK, given the country's skills shortage.  It accused ministers of ""starving"" higher education of funds, while encouraging the exploitation of foreign students as ""cash cows through astronomical fees and violent visa regimes"". Source: The Higher Education Statistics Agency  Mr Sunak's official spokesman insisted the PM supported Britain's universities which were ""some of the very best in the world"". But he was also ""fully committed"" to bringing overall immigration levels down, blaming ""unprecedented and unique circumstances"" for the record high. The official said: ""We're considering all options to make sure the immigration system is delivering, and that does include looking at the issue of student dependants and low-quality degrees."" Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney described the proposals as ""stupid"", and Education Minister Jamie Hepburn warned they would be ""deeply damaging to Scotland's world-class university sector"". The Scottish National Party has consistently praised the contribution made by foreign students and other migrants to Scotland.  Official figures show around 504,000 more people are estimated to have moved to the UK than left in the 12 months to June 2022, up sharply from 173,000 in the year to June 2021. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the jump was driven by ""unique"" factors including visa schemes for Ukrainians and Hong Kong citizens, and students arriving from outside the European Union. People arriving on study visas accounted for the largest proportion of long-term immigration of non-EU nationals, at 277,000, or 39% of the total, according to the ONS. The government has promised to cut net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the UK. Ms Braverman has said she wants to revive a repeatedly missed target to reduce net migration to below 100,000."

The development, from Atlantic Hub, will host computer data and services equipment for large tech companies. Londonderry Chamber of Commerce chief, Paul Clancy, said the development will be ""transformative"" for the north west. It is hoped the facility will generate ""up to 100 jobs"" at the site and attract further investment. The campus at Foyle Port will have the capacity for up to one million sq ft of technical floor space with complementary hi-tech office accommodation - one of the largest ever property developments in the north west.  Brian Doherty, who is the managing director of Atlantic Hub, says that Foyle Port is a fantastic location to establish the centre.  ""Location is key because a data centre needs good connectivity, a good power source and good climate conditions and we have got those three perquisites in spades at Foyle Port,"" Mr Doherty said. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Mr Doherty said that the company intends to utilise wind power and ""intends to be the greenest, environmentally friendly data centre in Western Europe"".  ""We envisage that once the facility is developed there would be jobs of up to 100 or more,"" Mr Doherty said.  However, Mr Doherty said that data centres, as seen in Dublin, can attract large businesses that want to be located close to them.  ""At the moment we are talking to clients, who not only require data centre services, but also are looking at the potential to establish operations facilities here in support of those services."" ""That could lead to hundreds of jobs and we hope that is the case,"" he added. Director of Foyle Port, George Cuthbert, said that the port has started to think about ""diversification"" and planning for the future.  ""A large part of our cargo, which is coal and oil, is eventually going to reduce and probably going to disappear completely in the future,"" Mr Cuthbert said.  ""There is an unstoppable move towards a green economy,"" he added."

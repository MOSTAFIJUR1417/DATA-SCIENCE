smashed through a hastily built wall they uncovered a set of secret jail cells it turned out to be a freshly bricked up doorway an attempt to hide what lurked behind inside off a narrow hallway were tiny rooms to the right and left it was pitch black the team may never have found this clandestine jail a stone s throw from Dhaka s international airport without the recollections of rim Ahmad bin quasar and others a critic of Bangladesh s ousted leader he was held there for eight years he was blindfolded for much of his time in the prison so he leaned on the sounds he could recall and he distinctly remembered the sound of planes landing that was what helped lead investigators to the military base near the airport behind the main building on the compound they found the smaller heavily guarded windowless structure made of brick and concrete where detainees were kept it was hidden in plain sight investigators have spoken to hundreds of victims like quasar since mass protests toppled prime minister sheikh aphasia waxed s government last august and inmates in the jails were released many others are alleged to have been killed unlawfully the people running the secret prisons including the one over the road from Dhaka airport were largely from an elite counter terrorism unit the rapid action battalion bar acting on orders directly from aphasia investigators say the officers concerned said all the enforced disappearance cases have been done with the approval permission or order by the prime minister herself tactful Islam the chief prosecutor for the international crimes tribunal of Bangladesh told the BBC aphasia s party says the alleged crimes were carried out without its knowledge that it bears no responsibility and that the military establishment operated alone a charge the army rejects seven months on quasar and others may have been released but they remain terrified of their captors who are serving security force members and are all still free quasar says he never leaves home without wearing a hat and mask i always have to watch my back when i m traveling he slowly walks up a flight of concrete steps to show the BBC where he was kept pushing through a heavy metal door he bends his head low and goes through another narrow doorway into his room the cell where he was held for eight years it felt like being buried alive being totally cut off from the outside world he tells the BBC there were no windows and no doors to natural light when he was inside he could t tell between day or night quasar a lawyer in his s has done interviews before but this is the first time he has taken the media for a detailed look inside the tiny cell where he was held viewed by torchlight it is so small an average sized person would have difficulty standing up straight it smells musty some of the walls are broken and bits of brick and concrete lie strewn on the ground a last ditch attempt by perpetrators to destroy any evidence of their crimes this is one detention center we have found that more than cells are there all through the country this shows that this was widespread and systematic says Islam the prosecutor who accompanied the BBC on the visit to the jail quasar also clearly remembers the faint blue tiles from his cell now lying in pieces on the floor which led investigators to this particular room in comparison to the cells on the ground floor this one is much larger at ft x ft m x m there is a squatting toilet off to one side in painful detail quasar walks around the room describing how he spent his time during his years in captivity during the summers it was unbearably hot he would crouch on the floor and put his face as close to the base of the doorway as he could to get some air it felt worse than death he says coming back to relive his punishment seems cruel but quasar believes it is important for the world to see what was done the high officials the top brass who aided and abetted facilitated the fascist regime are still in their position he says we need to get our story out and do whatever we can to ensure justice for those who did t return and to help those who are surviving to rehabilitate into life previous reports said he was kept inside a notorious detention facility known as anchorage or house of mirrors inside the main intelligence headquarters in Dhaka but investigators now believe there were many such sites quasar told the BBC he spent all his detention at the bar base apart from the first days investigators now suspect the first site was a detective branch of police in Dhaka he believes he was disappeared because of his family s politics in he d been representing his father a senior member of the country s largest Islamist party the pajama e mislaid who was on trial and later hanged five other men the BBC spoke to described being taken away blindfolded and handcuffed kept in dark concrete cells with no access to the outside world in many cases they say they were beaten and tortured while the BBC cannot independently verify their stories almost all say they are petrified that one day they might bump into a captor on the street or on a bus now whenever i get into a car or i m alone at home i feel scared thinking about where i was batik Brahman laser says i wonder how i survived whether i was really supposed to survive he says his nose was broken and his hand is still painful they put handcuffs on me and beat me a lot laser says he was approached by a group of men outside a mosque in Dhaka s old city last July as anti government protests raged they said they were from law enforcement and he had to go with them the next minute he was taken into a Grey car handcuffed hooded and blindfolded forty minutes later he was pulled out of the car taken into a building and put in a room after about half an hour people started coming in one by one and asking questions who are you what do you do then the beatings started he says being inside that place was terrifying i felt like i would never get out laser now lives with his sister and her husband sitting on a dining chair in her flat in Dhaka he describes his weeks in captivity in detail he speaks with little emotion seemingly detached from his e tongue sticking out experience he too believes his detention was politically motivated because he was a student leader with the rival Bangladesh nationalist party bap of which his father was a senior member his brother who lived abroad would frequently write social media posts critical of aphasia laser says there was no way of knowing where he was held but after watching interim leader Muhammad sinus visiting three detention centers earlier this year he thinks he was kept in gargantuan district in Dhaka it was an open secret that aphasia had no tolerance for political dissent criticizing her could get you disappeared without a trace former detainees opponents and investigators say but the total number of people who went missing may never become clear a Bangladeshi no that has tracked enforced disappearances since has documented at least people who were forcibly disappeared among them people remain missing since the commission of inquiry on enforced disappearances was created in September they have received more than complaints from alleged victims and more people continue to come forward but that does t represent the total number which is believed to be much higher it is through speaking to people like quasar that tactful Islam is able to build a case against those responsible for the detention centers including sheikh aphasia despite being held at different sites the narrative of victims is eerily similar Mohammad ail Arafat spokesperson for aphasia s swami league party denies any involvement he says if people were forcibly disappeared it was not done under the direction of aphasia who remains in India where she fled or anyone in her cabinet if any such detention did occur it would have been a product of complex internal military dynamics said Arafat i see no political benefit for the swami league or for the government to keep these people in secret detention the military s chief spokesman said it has no knowledge of the things being implied the army categorically denies operating any such detention centers Lt col mullah bin aid told the BBC tactful Islam believes the people held in these prisons are evidence of swami league involvement all the people who were detained here were from different political identities and they just raised their voice against the previous regime the government of that time and that is why they were brought here to date they have issued arrest warrants but no one has yet been brought to justice which is why victims like Iqbal chowder believe their lives are still in danger chowder wants to leave Bangladesh for years after he was released in he did t leave his house not even to go to the market chowder was warned by his captors never to speak of his detention if you ever reveal where you were or what happened and if you are taken again no one will ever find or see you again you will be vanished from this world he says he was told accused of writing propaganda against India and the swami league chowder says that is why he was tortured i was physically assaulted with an electric shock as well as being beaten now one of my fingers is heavily damaged by the electric shock i lost my leg s strength lost physical strength he remembers the sound of others being physically tortured grown men howling and crying in agony i am still scared says chowder ayatollah is also terrified they took away a year and a half of my life those times won t ever be returned he says they made me sleep in a place where a human being should not even be on august he was taken from his home at midnight by bar officers some in uniform and others dressed in plain clothes he was working as a cook in a neighboring town while training to be an electrician after repeated interrogations it became clear to ayatollah he was being forcibly detained for his anti India and Islamic posts on social media using a pen and paper he draws the layout of his cell including the open drain he would use to relieve himself even thinking about that place in Dhaka makes me feel horrible there was no space to lie down properly so i had to sleep being curled up i could t stretch my legs while lying down the BBC also interviewed two other former detainees Michael charisma and masseur an war to corroborate some of the details about the secret prisons and what is alleged to have gone on inside them some of the victims live with physical scars from their detentions all of them talk about the psychological torment that follows them everywhere they go Bangladesh is at a pivotal moment in its history as it tries to rebuild after years of autocratic rule a crucial test of the country s progress towards democracy will be its ability to hold a fair trial for the perpetrators of these crimes Islam believes it can and must happen we must stop the recurrence of this type of offense for our future generations and we have to do justice for the victims they suffered a lot standing in what remains of his concrete cell quasar says a trial must take place as soon as possible so the country can close this chapter it s not so simple for ayatollah the fear has not gone away the fear will remain until i die"

The Hague","Hungary is withdrawing from the international criminal court ICC its government has announced a senior official in prime minister victor urban s government confirmed this hours after Israel s leader Benjamin planetary who is sought under an ICC arrest warrant arrived in Hungary for a state visit urban had invited planetary as soon as the warrant was issued last November saying the ruling would have no effect in his country in November ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds that planetary bore criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war between Israel and hams planetary has condemned the ICC s decision as antisemitic the ICC a global court has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes Hungary is a founding member of the ICC which counts member states and will be the first European union nation to pull out of it a withdrawal has no impact on ongoing proceedings during a joint press conference urban asserted that the ICC had become a political court he added the court s decision to issue a warrant against the Israeli leader clearly showed this planetary meanwhile hailed Hungary s bold and principled decision to withdraw from the court it s important for all democracies it s important to stand up to this corrupt organization planetary said a statement from the Israeli prime minister s office on Thursday said planetary and urban had spoken with us president Donald trump about the decision and the next steps that can be taken on this issue earlier Israel s foreign minister Gideon SA AR thanked urban on x for his clear and strong moral stance alongside Israel the so called international criminal court lost its moral authority after trampling the fundamental principles of international law in its zest for harming Israel s right to self defense SA AR added Hungary s decision aligns with its broader foreign policy stance under urban who has cultivated close ties with Israel and adopted a critical view of international institutions perceived as infringing on national sovereignty while Hungary s withdrawal may carry symbolic weight and political implications it does not significantly alter the ICC s operational capacity or legal framework the court has faced similar challenges in the past and continues to function with broad international support but Hungary s criticism of the ICC as politically biased and its decision to withdraw as planetary visits may set a precedent for other nations to question or abandon their commitments to international justice based on political alliances or disagreements with specific rulings the us Russia china and north chorea are among the nations that are not part of the ICC and therefore do not recognize its jurisdiction Israel is also not part of the treaty but the ICC ruled in that it did have jurisdiction over the occupied west bank east Jerusalem and Gaza because the UN s secretary general had accepted that Palestinians were a member Hungary now needs to send written notification to the UN secretary general to leave the treaty with the withdrawal taking effect one year later according to article of the more statute which established the ICC ICC spokesman fad e mullah told the BBC on the visit of rm planetary the court has followed its standard procedures after the issuance of an arrest warrant the court recalls that Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate with the ICC since the warrant was issued Hungarian authorities should technically arrest planetary and hand him over to the court in the Hague although member states do not always choose to enforce ICC warrants in Europe some ICC member states said they would arrest the Israeli leader if he set foot in their country while others including Germany announced that planetary would not be detained if he visited but Germany s foreign minister annals paperback said on Thursday Hungary s announcement was a bad day for international criminal law Europe has clear rules that apply to all EU member states and that is the more statute i have made it clear time and again that no one in Europe is above the law and that applies to all areas of law she added on the other side of the Atlantic the us has condemned the ICC s decision to issue warrants for planetary s arrest and he has visited the country since it was issued in November his visit to Hungary marks planetary s first trip to Europe since then Hungarian defense minister tourist allay bobrovniczky greeted planetary on the tarmac of Budapest airport on Wednesday night welcoming him to the country Israel is appealing against the arrest warrants for planetary and former defense minister yo av gallant and strongly rejects the accusations it both denies the authority of the ICC and the legitimacy of the warrants planetary said at the time that it was a dark day in the history of humanity and that the ICC had become the enemy of humanity it s an antisemitic step that has one goal to deter me to deter us from having our natural right to defend ourselves against enemies who try to destroy us he said in the same ruling ICC judges also issued a warrant against hams military commander mo hammed def who Israel says is dead hams also rejected the allegations the visit comes as Israel announced it was e tongue sticking out sanding its Gaza offensive and establishing a new military corridor to put pressure on hams as deadly Israeli strikes continued across the Palestinian territory the war in Gaza was

the judgment of others in the cricket establishment many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him recalls scavenger an example of kohl s obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy kohl was playing his second kanji trophy match for Delhi his father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis after the funeral he went back and scored a battling scavenger s approving eye earned kohl an oi debut in at he was the youngest member of India s oi world cup winning team under ms dhoti a few weeks later he made his test debut in the west indies some months on during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat kohl made a gritty maiden century and never looked back within a couple of years he established himself as the per eminent batter of his generation brash and provocative without a benign muscle in his body he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years he was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents often indulging in on field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism happily this was not to become his defining identity in cricket prolific run getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle when his idol saccharin undulate retired in kohl allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history he wielded the bat like a Jedi with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents as it were coupled with his high octane persona his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box office returns everywhere he played kohl always wore his passion on his sleeve he was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights marriage to film star babushka dharma made them the country s foremost power couple putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight metaphorically kohl s outstanding e tongue sticking out toils especially in the first decade of his career epitomized the emerging India of the st century unabashedly unrelentingly ambitious discarding all past demons willing to take on the best in the world his achievements across formats are monumental in Odis he is third in run aggregate behind undulate and markup sanguinary but boasts the best average among batters who have played more than games his ability to win oi matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore many of his record centuries coming in such pursuit in ts his run aggregate and centuries don t put him in the top five but he s immortalized himself with incredible knocks notably not out in an emotion charged pulsating match against arch rivals Pakistan in the world cup and a vital in the final against south Africa which helped India win the title he is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian premier league at one point kohl averaged plus in all three formats making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era way ahead of contemporaries Joe root Kane Williamson and Steve smith the four were locked in a fascinating long running race for batting supremacy when it appeared he would break all batting records kohl s career took an one tongue sticking out livable downturn from the start of the pandemic the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle in his pomp between and he had been unstoppable at one time scoring six double centuries in just months the drought of runs hit him most adversely in test cricket where his average from a high of plus in slumped to the current in this period kohl also lost the captaincy though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched kohl finishes his test career with runs which puts him ht overall in aggregate and fourth among Indians behind undulate hurrah gravid and sunlit gasworks all of whom finished with a plus average and more centuries but to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format as captain kohl easily hurdles over gasworks undulate and gravid in

former India captain and chief coach rave shariah who collaborated with kohl for years gives first hand perspective kohl made India into a fighting unit especially when playing overseas says shariah the lack of ICC and pl titles according to shariah is misleading as an index to his captaincy ability he always played to win sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players putting himself in the forefront not as a backseat driver for seven years when kohl and shariah collaborated India were in the top three in ICC rankings in all formats almost continuously which is unprecedented the most cherished and significant triumph of this period came in when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a test series for the first time ever Australia is where kohl had launched himself into batting greatness scoring runs in four tests in in he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier in touring Australia kohl played only one match which was lost returning home for the birth of his child but India having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see saw series Australia was kohl s happy hunting ground and his last visit down under in late grabbed worldwide attention he began with a roar hitting a century in the first test at Perth but his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only runs in the five tests how much this contributed to his decision to retire is moot advancing years the dislike of being constantly under harsh scrutiny wanting to be close to his young family and behind the scene shenanigans that abound in Indian cricket have doubtless played a part too kohl ends his retirement post on Instagram

s hit show adolescence which was watched by more than million people worldwide in its first month it would t have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago the show s

approved a b m bailout to Pakistan a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear armed neighbors flared before a us led ceasefire was rune tongue sticking out dejectedly declared despite India s protests the IMF board approved the second installment of a b loan saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programmer implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan it also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan s efforts in building economic resilience to climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters providing further access of around b in funding in the future in a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision citing two reasons Delhi questioned the efficacy of such bailouts or the lack thereof given Pakistan s poor track record in implementing reform measures but more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for state sponsored cross border terrorism a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied and said the IMF was e tongue sticking out sing itself and its donors to reputation risks and making a mockery of global values the IMF did not respond to the BBC s request for a comment on the Indian stance even Pakistani e tongue sticking out erst argue that there s some merit to Delhi s first argument Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF s help getting bailed out times since without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance going to the IMF is like going to the ICU intensive care unit if a patient goes or times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with hussar harlequin former Pakistani ambassador to the us told the BBC but addressing Delhi s other concerns that the IMF was rewarding continued sponsorship of cross border terrorism thereby sending a dangerous message to the global community is far more complex and perhaps e tongue sticking out liens why India awns t able to exert pressure to stall the bailout India s decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then rather than a desire for any tangible outcome say e tongue sticking out erst as per the country s own observations the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan and was circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities as one of the members of the IMF board India s influence at the fund is limited it represents a four country group including sir Lanka Bangladesh and Bhutan Pakistan is part of the central Asia group represented by Iran unlike the united nations one country one vote system the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country s economic size and its contributions a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favoring richer western countries over developing economies for example the us has the biggest voting share at while India holds just besides IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal board members can either vote in favor or abstain and the decisions are made by consensus on the board this shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions an economist who did t want to speak on the record told the BBC addressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India s g presidency in in their report former Indian bureaucrat kn hings and former us treasury secretary Lawrence summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the global north and the global south but there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations furthermore recent changes in the IMF s own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue a b loan by the fund to Ukraine in was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war it bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already arranged loan to Pakistan mirth dharma of the observer research foundation fro think tank in Delhi told the BBC if India really wants to address its grievances the right forum to present them would be the united nations fat financial action task force says rm harlequin the fat looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on Grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the world bank grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work said rm harlequin if a country is on that fat list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF as has happened with Pakistan earlier as things stand though Pakistan was officially removed from the financial action task force fat Grey list in separately e tongue sticking out erst also caution that India s calls to overhaul the IMF s funding processes and veto

the so called red team service have to assemble staff with very particular skills often using former military and intelligence personnel red teams are asked one question how can you break into this top secret project Leonardo the giant defense company offers such a service it says hostile states seeking disruption and chaos are a real threat and sells its red team capability to government critical infrastructure and defense sector clients other companies offer red team services but there are not many in the business as the specialist skills needed are rare firms offering such services like to keep a low profile and are usually extremely reluctant to talk to the press however Leonardo s red team agreed to speak to the BBC under pseudonyms Greg the team leader served in the engineering and intelligence arms of the British army studying the digital capabilities of potential enemies i spent a decade learning how to e tongue sticking out toil enemy communications he says of his background now he co ordinates the five strong team the attack is about gaining access the objective might be to stop a process from working such as the core of a nuclear power plant the first step for Greg and his team is called passive reconnaissance using an anonymous device perhaps a smartphone only identifiable by its sim card the team build a picture of the target we must avoid raising suspicions so the target does t know we re looking at them Greg says any technology they employ is not linked to a business by its internet address and is bought with cash charlie spent years in military intelligence his techniques include studying commercial satellite imagery of a site and scanning job ads to work out what type of people work there we start from the edges of the target staying away then we start to move into the target area even looking at how people who work there dress this is known as hostile reconnaissance they are getting close to the site but keeping their e tongue sticking out sure low wearing different clothes every time they show up and swapping out team members so security people don t spot the same person walking past the gates technology is devised by people and the human factor is the weakest point in any security set up this is where Emma who served in the RAF comes in with a background in psychology Emma happily calls herself a bit of a nosy people watcher people take shortcuts past security protocols so we look for disgruntled people at the site she listens in to conversations at adjacent cafes and pubs to hear where dissatisfaction with an employer surfaces every organization has its quirks we see what the likelihood of people falling for a suspicious email due to workload and fatigue is an unhappy security guard may get lazy at work we re looking at access slipping in with a delivery for instance a high turnover rate evidenced by frequently advertised vacancies also flags up dissatisfaction and a lack of engagement with security responsibilities tailgating spotting people who are likely to hold an access door open for a follower is another technique using that intelligence plus a little subterfuge security passes can be copied and the red team can enter the premises posing as an employee once inside the site Dan knows how to open doors filing cabinets and desk drawers he s armed with lock pick keys known as jugglers with multiple contours that can spring a lock open he s searching for passwords written down or will use a plug in smart USB adapter to simulate a computer keyboard breaking into a network the final step in the so called kill chain is in the hands of Stanley a cuber security e tongue sticking out err Stanley knows how to penetrate the most secure computer systems working on the reconnaissance

one way a kill chain concludes is when Stanley sends an email impersonating the chief executive of the business via the internal hence trusted network even though they operate with the approval of the target customer they are breaking into a site as complete strangers how does this feel if you be gained access to a server room that is quite nerve wracking says Dan but it gets easier the more times

said it will stop selling goods imported from china in the us directly to customers from its platform the online marketplace said sales would now be handled by locally based sellers with orders fulfilled from within the country the move comes as a duty free rule for low value packages is closed emu and rival Chinese retail giant shin had previously relied on the so called DE minims exemption to sell and ship low value items directly to the us without having to pay duties or import taxes emu said it had been actively recruiting us firms to join the platform all sales in the us are now handled by locally based sellers with orders fulfilled from within the country the move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses it added supporters of the DE minims loophole which applied to parcels worth less than argue it helped streamline the customs process but both trump and his predecessor Joe Biden said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods including drugs DE minims is a Latin term which loosely translates to English as of the smallest in this context it refers to a us trade rule enacted by congress in to avoid the e tongue sticking out ens of collecting only small amounts of import levies in the st century after a series of rises to the threshold it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than to us customers without having to pay duties or taxes shipments under the exemption accounted for more than of all the cargo entering the us according to the country s customs and border patrol cap Chinese online retailers like shin and emu had benefited greatly from the loophole both platforms attracted millions of us customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra low prices and it was the DE minims exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply shin did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment last month in almost identical statements shin and emu said they had seen operating e tongue sticking out senses rise due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs adding they would make price adjustments from April in February trump briefly closed the loophole the suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice during the initial suspension of the exemption the us postal service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland china and Hong gonk the executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic diploids like entangle it said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low value packages to e tongue sticking out toil the DE minims exemption these drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year including deaths per year attributed to entangle alone it added the idea is not new last year the Biden administration proposed rules intended to stop abuse of the exemption the growing volume of DE minims shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments it said the move is in line with trump s policies of cracking down on goods from china since returning to the white house in January trump has imposed taxes of up to on Chinese imports his administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach us authorities have also blamed the success of firms like emu and shin for putting strains on border authorities as the number of packages entering the us under the loophole surged from about million a decade ago to more than one billion last year packages sent to the us from mainland china and Hong gonk with a value of up to now face a tax rate or are subject to a flat fee the fee started at and is due to rise to at the beginning of June even before these packages were subject to import taxes us consumers were warned of potential price rises the American action forum a right leaning policy group estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in b to b in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European union in a move mirroring the us action the UK has announced a review of low value imports coming into the country in the UK the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than without incurring import taxes chancellor Rachel reeves said the cheap goods are undercutting the British high street and British retailers the European union has also proposed plans to scrap duty free exemptions for parcels worth less than which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising packages that arrived in the us under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods including being checked for illegal substances and most synthetic diploids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico according to officials some e tongue sticking out erst think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by us manufacturers there are also concerns the move will create more work for us border officials who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling according to pro open trading association the national foreign trade council FTC removing the DE minims exemption would shift the cap s focus away from the border where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country cap would need to hire and train new personnel costing the agency millions or causing them to move agents from the already overburdened southern border it added"

February over north Queensland Australia many locals endured sleepless nights unsure what level of flooding and damage they would wake up to perhaps none more so than Andrew brown a cybernetics lecturer by day with a side hustle as a self made amateur weather forecaster few know that rm brown is the brains behind wally s weather a Facebook page with followers and million monthly views focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland during the record breaking flooding when people were forced to evacuate their homes rm brown published round the clock posts even waking in the night to share updates out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience he even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non stop rain would be approaching advising not just his Facebook followers but his bosses colleagues wife and adult children to do the same when there s a big weather event you try and give people as much notice as possible he is based in townspeople the regional center of an area known for a rain drenched hot humid wet season from January to march people want to know what s going on because even if they lose power they be probably still got an internet connection these systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can t see what s going on so you do feel like their eyes and ears says rm brown rm brown s active highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates in the us it s how of adults get this information according to pew research center people pay as much attention to influences on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on you tube Instagram and ticktock according to a study by the Reuters institute and university of oxford prof denial Angus is director of the digital media research center at Queensland university of technology when Brisbane based prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by tropical cyclone flared also in February he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian bureau of meteorology as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings prof Angus recognizes the rising popularity of weather influences like rm brown s wally s weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources but about filling gaps in coverage and repeatability weather influences have gained popularity particularly in rural and regional areas because they provide highly localized real time updates that mainstream media can often overlook says prof Angus they engage directly with their audience offering personalized analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don t their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate knowledgeable and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on yet the issue with weather influences prof Angus notes is their tendency to scaremonger as social media weather forecaster Higgins storm chasing also based in townspeople has been criticized for in it was criticized for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers which did t materialist Higgins storm chasing which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas interferon did t respond to the BBC s request for an interview weather influences are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts which has led to claims of scaremongering and propagation of misinformation e tongue sticking out liens prof Angus what we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy the more eyes they have the more engagement they see on their metrics the bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders because it only takes a few non events for people to lose their trust in them says professor Angus they have to answer for that whereas for Higgins or any of the others there s ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up it s a view shared by anal seals a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the university of south Alabama and consults as a forensic meteorologist providing weather analysis for legal cases prof seals is also now the president elect of the American meteorological society mas which welcomes both professionally trained meteorologists and weather influences as members so does t have an official position on the topic but prof seals personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession there are those who are not formally trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long range weather outlooks as though they are as accurate as short range forecasts particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather that s considered hype that makes people click and share increasing the popularity of the influence he says trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely when in reality it is uncertain and unknown on the other hand there are weather influences who have the equipment and e tongue sticking out expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme in times of crisis often giving more focus to communities that don t get full coverage from traditional TV stations while Andrew brown of wally s weather is self taught in meteorology he has a masters in it and numerous other technology qualifications his investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago but they mainly just cover his costs the advancement of AI he says gives him more time to accurately analyses data and communicate it to his followers it will also allow him to e tongue sticking out and to an Australia wide operation yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing Colorado based Andrew markdown has a meteorology degree and works full time for an energy company but also has followers on a ticktock weather page through a combination of live stream donations sponsorship brand deals and ticktock s creativity program which helps creators monetize their content rm markdown says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month it s definitely not enough to quit my job nor would i want to i just treat it as fun money on the side which i usually spend on travels says rm markdown back in Australia rm brown says he would like to retire from teaching and have more time to focus on wally s weather and to spend with his grandchildren but acknowledges that this is a while away but what he does t want is to be the face of the page something he s so far avoided i don t go out of my way to reveal who i am because i like to be able to walk down the street and not

taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff free as part of a new agreement between the us and UK the announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs president Donald trump has announced since his return to the white house in January but it will leave a duty in place on most goods from the UK though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries as they stood before the changes introduced by trump this year no formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details speaking from a jaguar land rover factory in the west midlands sir heir smarter described the agreement as a fantastic platform this historic deal delivers for British business and British workers protecting thousands of British jobs in key sectors including car manufacturing and steel he said adding that the the UK has no greater ally than the united states at the white house trump called it a great deal and pushed back against criticism that he was overstating its importance this is a maxed out deal that we re going to make bigger he said the two sides said the us had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars which trump had raised by last month to for cars a year that will help luxury carmakers such as jaguar land rover and rolls Royce but could limit growth in the years ahead as it amounts to roughly what the UK e tongue sticking out sorted last year business secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing us tariffs this was very serious he said it would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough tariffs on steel and aluminum which trump raised earlier this year to have also been slashed according to the prime minister s office the us said instead it would establish a

five weeks ago said Duncan Edwards chief executive of alphanumerical business which represents firms in the two countries and supports free trade i m trying to be excited but i m struggling a bit while labor mos praised the deal opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in parliament conservative party leader semi backbench criticized the deal saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK while being hiked in the us this is not a historic deal with the us she said we be been shafted the liberal democrats demanded a vote on the deal in parliament saying it would show complete disrespect to the public if mos were denied a say sir ed cadaver said when it comes to any trade deal and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald trump the devil will be in the detail one thing is clear trump s trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK reform UK leader Nigel garage said the deal was a step in the right direction he told the BBC there was more detail to come but in the round it was a welcome development the important point is that we are doing stuff we are making a move he said it s a Brexit benefit we were able to do this the us and UK have been discussing a trade deal since trump s first term they came close to signing a mini agreement at that time but the us has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues which had been non starters politically for the UK it was not clear how much those issues had advanced the national cattlemen s beef association said the agreement in principle had delivered a tremendous win for American ranchers but the us meat e tongue sticking out rot federation which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the us said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes the UK said there would be no weakening in food standards for imports while the UK appears to have made some commitments the devil will be in the details said Michael pierce deputy chief economist at oxford economics which said it was making no change to its economic forecasts as a result of the announcement other issues loom trump has said repeatedly that he wants to tax imports of pharmaceuticals in a bid to ensure the us has a strong manufacturing base for critical medicines the UK said the us had agreed to give British

Germany and i m on my way to meet a robot i have been invited to see the g a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm uni tree at the handover mess one of the world s largest industrial trade shows standing at about cm g is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral today the g is being controlled remotely by Pedro lengthen the uni tree sales manager he e tongue sticking out liens that customers must program each g for autonomous functions passers by stop and actively try to engage with the g which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room they reach out to shake its hand make sudden movements to see if it will respond they laugh when g waves or bends backwards they apologies if they bump into it there s something about its human shape that uncanny as it is sets people at ease uni tree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form the potential is huge for business it promises a workforce that does t need holidays or pay rises it could also be the ultimate domestic appliance after all who would t want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher but the technology is still some way off while robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment like a restaurant or a home is a much more difficult problem to be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong but that also makes them potentially dangerous simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous so much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine the AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment a uni tree spokesperson tells the BBC today s robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way a challenge they said at the moment their g is marketed at research institutions and tech companies who can use uni tree s open source software for development for now entrepreneurs are focusing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories the highest profile of those is eon musk his car company teals is developing a humanoid robot called optimums in January he said that several thousand will be built this year and he e

those with two arms and legs if you broaden the definition to robots with two arms but propel themselves on wheels then he looks at more than firms rm understand thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market the supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in china and it s really easy to iterate developments and do r d research and development he says uni tree underlines that advantage its g is cheap for a robot with an advertised price of also rm understand points out the investment favors Asian nations in a recent report stir notes that almost of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia with the us attracting most of the rest Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government for example in shanghai there is a state backed training facility for robots where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks so how can us and European robot makers compete with that Bristol based been pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest kidskin has just launched the Kr robot while the robot has been designed and developed in the UK it will be manufactured in Asia the problem you get as a European or American company you have to buy all these sub components from china in the first place so then it becomes stupid to buy your motors buy your batteries buy your resistors shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source which is in Asia as well as making his robots in Asia rm pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form designed for warehouses and factories the Kr does not have legs all of these places have flat floors why would you want the added e tongue sticking out ens of a very complex form factor when you could just put it on a mobile base he asks where possible his Kr is built with mass produced components the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter my philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf so all our motors batteries computers cameras they re all commercially available mass produced parts he says like his competitors at uni tree rm pierce says that the real secret sauce is the software that allows the robot to work with humans a lot of companies come out with very high tech robots but then you start needing a pd in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it what we re trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours rm pierce says he says the Kr can perform a task after being guided through it by a human or times the Kr will be given to pilot customers to test this year so will robots ever break out of factories into the home even the optimistic rm pierce says it s a long way off my long term dream for the last years has been building the everything robot this is what i was doing my pd work in i do think that is the end goal but it s a very complicated task says rm pierce i still think eventually they will be there but i think that s at least to years away"

at the john Glenn research center in Cleveland Ohio one big challenge for anyone developing technology for the moon are the huge temperature ranges at the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower

winds la guarani has now become the epicenter of the country s shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy but this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals whose territory is deeply tied to culture tradition and a profound connection to nature you wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees instead you see and hear the turbines rm iguar<c3><a1>n says his community now shares its land with guarani one of Colombia s two operational wind farms another wind farms are currently under construction in la guarani and there are plans for dozens more at night the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams for us dreams are sacred rm iguar<c3><a1>n adds the waylay who number around in Colombia and extend into Venezuela have distinct traditions and beliefs dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family despite the cultural disruptions rm iguar<c3><a1>n says that his community has benefited from guarani the energy company behind it Colombian firm envisage has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water better roads and sturdy brick houses which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones envisage which is owned by Canada s brook field also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there a percentage of annual electricity revenues and from the sale of carbon credits these are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions rm iguar<c3><a1>n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia s second poorest region but not everyone shares his enthusiasm the wind farms produce clean energy but they create division within the waylay communities e tongue sticking out liens Aaron lacuna a waylay fisherman who lives in the coastal village of cab DE la vela his community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby he has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency poor compensation a disrespect of cultural norms and corruption bad negotiations are made and the resources given to us earn t well managed by locals he adds these concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies and even conflict within waylay communities some oppose the projects while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits there is still this idea that if it is green it is automatically good says Joanna barney director of environment energy and communities at Colombian think tank independent it has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the waylay in Colombia there sin t a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts and the social impacts are immeasurable in December Spanish company EDP renov<c3><a1>veis shelved plans for two wind farms in la guarani saying the projects were no longer economically viable one factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected and therefore need compensation from to EDP s decision followed the may exit of Italian multinational eel from another planned wind farm in the region eel attributed its departure to constant protests that halted construction for more than half of the working days between and guarani was also marred by roadblocks a common way of protesting in la guarani when locals feel unheard and think tank independent has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms including armed robberies and kidnappings and in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighboring wind farms we call it the wind wars says ms barney for Colombian anthropologist wielder Guerra there is a clear disconnect between the waylay and the wind farm companies there are two worlds talking and they have not managed to understand each other he says this gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind the element central to these projects for the waylay the winds are people it is not the wind but the winds there are eight different winds in waylay culture mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected by contrast companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress profit and to address the country s energy needs while Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix with nearly two thirds coming from hydroelectricity the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels which creates a risk of energy shortages wind energy currently contributes just of the energy mix for energy companies investing in the region the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect one such firm eyes Colombia is developing the country s largest wind energy cluster in la guarani with six wind farms the company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities offering fair compensation and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits but it says good community relations are not

forecast for the UK has also been cut with the economy now e tongue sticking out acted to grow by this year but the IMF has predicted UK economic growth will be stronger than Germany France and Italy inflation in the UK however will be the highest in the world s advanced economies at this year largely due to higher bills including for energy and water the predictions come as top economic policymakers gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and world bank IMF chief economist Pierre Olivier outpourings said the global economy still bears significant scars from the severe shocks of the past four years it is now being severely tested once again he added on Tuesday us president Donald trump said he had no intention of firing federal reserve chair Jerome Powell after heavily criticizing him concerns that trump may try to sack Powell sparked a sell off in markets in recent days trump has made a flurry of announcements on tariffs this year taxes charged on goods brought into the us from other countries in a growing trade war the us has placed tariffs of up to on Chinese goods while china has hit back with levies on us products the us has also introduced a tax rate on goods from the vast majority of other countries while pausing much higher rates for dozens of nations for days trump says tariffs will encourage us consumers to buy more American made goods increase the amount of tax raised and lead to huge levels of investment in the country however the IMF highlighted the potential negative impact on global trade given that modern supply chains are so

forecast chancellor Rachel reeves said it showed the UK was still the fastest growing European g country due to reform which will drive up long term growth in the UK reeves added that the world has changed and she would be in Washington this week defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade however Mel stride the conservative shadow chancellor said the IMF outlook was a worrying indictment of labor s economic approach the IMF has downgraded the UK s growth forecast raising serious concerns about the lack of confidence and direction under labor they have also revised up significantly their forecast for inflation he said the IMF s world economic outlook also contains the following forecasts forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth and the IMF acknowledged its latest predictions had been particularly challenging the figures given are what the IMF calls its reference forecast based on the situation as at April which was two days after trump s announcement of wide ranging tariffs rm outpourings said that while the reference forecast was the IMF s central scenario many possible paths exist reflecting the unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the varied impact of tariffs across different countries the IMF also looked at the situation after the us temporarily suspended many tariffs while raising those on china sharply rm outpourings said the tariff pause did not materially change the global outlook from its reference forecast because the overall effective tariff rate of the us and

being built under the Baltic sea between Denmark and Germany which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia s links with the rest of Europe running for km miles the greenbelt will be the world s longest per fabricated road and rail tunnel it s also a remarkable feat of engineering that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor and then joined together the project s main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel on the coast of lowland island in the south east of Denmark the facility spans more than hectares acres and includes a harbor and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections which are called elements it s a huge facility here says Henrik incentive chief executive of fern the state owned danish company that is building the tunnel to make each m ft long and m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete most underwater tunnels including the km channel tunnel between the UK and France burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor here instead individual elements will be linked up piece by piece like loge bricks we are breaking records with this project says rm incentive immersed tunnels have been built before but never on this scale with a price tag around b b b the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark with b from the European commission it s among the region s largest ever infrastructure projects and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying once completed the journey between r<c3><b8>dbyhavn in southern Denmark and appurtenant in northern Germany will take just minutes by car or seven minutes by train replacing a minute ferry voyage bypassing western Denmark the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and hamburg from five to hours and provide a greener shortcut for freight and passengers it s not only linking Denmark to Germany it s linking Scandinavia to central Europe states rm incentive everybody s a winner he claims and by traveling km less you ll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport towered over by cranes the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead so now we are in the first part of the tunnel announces senior construction manager sanders get weed as we walk inside the future highway it s one of five parallel tubes in each element there are two for railway lines two for roads which have two lanes in each direction and a maintenance and emergency corridor at the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea as you can hear it s quite thick he says tapping on the metal when we have a finished element at the harbor it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here not only are these elements long they re enormously heavy weighing over tonnes yet incredibly sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats next it s a painstakingly complex procedure lowering the elements meters down into a trench dug out on the seafloor using underwater cameras and GPS guided equipment to line it up with mm precision we have to be very very careful emphasizes rm weed we have a system called pin and catch where you have a v shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element dragging it slowly into place Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes with layers of clay and bedrock of chalk the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel said per overmanning a professor in concrete and structures at the technical university of Denmark a bridge was initially considered but strong winds might disrupt traffic and security was another important consideration there was the risk of ships crashing into bridges we can build the bridge so they can withstand it he adds but this is rather deep water and the biggest ships can sail there so adds rm overmanning it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel they looked at it and said okay what is the cheapest the tunnel what is the safest the tunnel Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact one such environmental group nab the nature and biodiversity conservation union argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbor porpoises which are sensitive to underwater noise however in their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany which green lighted construction to go ahead we have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible says rm incentive pointing to a hectare wetland nature and recreational area that s planned on reclaimed land which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock when the tunnel opens in fern estimates that more than trains and cars will use it each day according to plans revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction and rm incentive calculates that will take around four decades ultimately the users are going to pay he says it s also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs business and tourism in lowland which is one of Denmark s poorest regions the locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years said rm weed who grew up nearby they re looking forward to businesses coming to the area"

tells you it was designed in California while the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the united states it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in china the country hit hardest by us president Donald trump s tariffs now rising to on some Chinese imports apple sells more than million phones a year and by most estimates nine in are made in china from the glossy screens to the battery packs it s here that many of the components in an apple product are made sourced and assembled into phones pads or mac books most are shipped to the us apple s largest market luckily for the firm trump suddenly exempted smartphones computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week but the comfort is short lived the president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming nobody is getting off the hook he wrote on truth social as his administration investigated semiconductors and the whole electronics supply chain the global supply chain that apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability the us and china the world s two biggest economies are interdependent and trump s staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight leading to an inevitable question who is the more dependent of the two china has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world s most valuable companies it was a calling card to the west for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation apple entered china in the s to sell computers through third party suppliers around when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals apple found a lifeline in china a young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs it awns t until though that apple officially arrived in china through a shanghai based trading company and started making products in the country it partnered with connect a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in china to make pods then macs and subsequently phones as Beijing began trading with the world encouraged by the us no less apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world s factory back then china was not primed to make the iPhone but apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into manufacturing superstars according to supply chain e tongue sticking out err nil pepping he cites the example of Beijing wingding now a leading manufacturer of high speed precision machinery which is used to make advanced components efficiently the company which used to cut acrylic was not considered a machine tool maker but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became the star of apple s mobile phone surface processing rm nil says apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in the year the city hosted the Olympics and china s relationship with the west was at an all time high this soon snowballed to stores with customers queuing out of the door as apple s profit margins grew so did its assembly lines in china with connect operating the world s largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou which has since been termed iPhone city for a fast growing china apple became a symbol of advanced western tech simple yet original and slick today most of apple s prized phones are manufactured by connect the advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan by the world s largest chip manufacturer USMC the manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras some of apple s top suppliers in had factories in china according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia there s no supply chain in the world that s more critical to us than china apple s chief executive chm cook said in an interview last year in trump s first term apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on china but this time the trump administration has made an example of apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics it believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make phones that kind of thing is going to come to America commerce secretary Howard nutpick said in an interview earlier this month white house press secretary Caroline levitate reiterated that last week president trump has made it clear America cannot rely on china to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors chips smartphones and laptops she added at the direction of the president these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the united states as soon as possible but many are skeptical of that the thought that apple could move its assembly operation to the us is pure fantasy according to lei Friedman who formerly sat on the firm s academic advisory board he says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from china since when he joined the board but the us was never an option rm Friedman adds that apple did t make much progress over the next decade but really made an effort after the pandemic when china s tightly controlled

unwary both of which Israel has barred in Gaza Israel stopped allowing aid into Gaza on march which it said was to pressure hams into releasing hostages the UN and aid agencies say food and supplies are running out in Gaza which Israel denies last year Israel severed ties with unwary accusing it of colluding with hams the hearings at the Hague are e tongue sticking out acted to last for five days though a ruling could take many months am mar hijab the Palestinian ambassador to international organizations in the Hague opened the hearings with a disturbing and graphic testimony he accused Israel of a genocidal campaign against the Palestinians adding that Israel s crimes put Palestinians at risk of irreparable harm the Palestinian ambassador to the united nations riyal man sour at times his voice breaking hands shaking told the judges it has never been more painful to be Palestinian he said Israel was seeking deliberately to deprive the population in Gaza to ensure it has no way to survive and that people were trapped between death and displacement he described unwary as a shining example of multilateral ism at the UN and called for a place where Palestinian families could be reunited in life rather than death in a statement coinciding with the start of the hearings Israel s foreign minister Gideon Saar said it had decided not to take part in this circus it is another attempt to politicize and abuse the legal process in order to persecute Israel he said Israel won t be among the countries speaking at the ice this week but has provided a page written submission to the court in which it outlines the ways in which it claims unwary has been infiltrated by hams and argues that Israel is entitled to end cooperation with the organization for the sake of its own security the only countries likely to defend Israel in court are the us and Hungary at issue are two bills passed by Israel s parliament in October that declared unwary harbored terrorists and ordered the government to end all co operation and contact with the organization including the supply of visas to unwary international employees unwary has challenged Israel s allegation that it knowingly has hams members in its ranks or that it co operated with the armed group the focus of these hearings is to aid the judges in answering the question posed by the UN general assembly specifically whether Israel acted unlawfully in overriding the communities and privileges of a UN body but with statements live streamed around the world from the peace palace home to the ice in the Hague the process is being used to highlight the wider concerns and context in December a vast majority of countries at the UN general assembly voted to get the ice involved for a definitive interpretation of the law and Israel s obligations since then the humanitarian situation in Gaza has got worse two weeks after cutting off aid a ceasefire which had offered some respite for gazes since January collapsed when Israel resumed its military offensive Israel and hams blamed each other for the end of the truce the current Israeli blockade is the longest closure Gaza has ever faced the UN says Israel as an

Catherine dean saw her company s Instagram account get hacked she says it was devastating it felt like the rug had been pulled from under us Instagram is our primary social platform and we be invested the most amount of time and business resources into it to keep the account current we post content every day suddenly all this work it was just pulled ms dean s UK based business which is named after her sells wedding dresses online with her biggest market being the us on Instagram it now has followers but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue badge verification from Instagram which is owned by Facebook s meta this was the stamp of authenticity that ms dean had long sought we were obviously very excited about that she says so her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log in credentials she filled it in divulging the username and password and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers what added to ms dean s anguish was that she says she had to fight with meta to get her account back which took four months initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off but heard nothing multiple emails followed but no action was taken it s so incredibly frustrating when you re dealing with your account being hacked and there is no one to talk to she says it s almost traumatizing because there is no one who understands and can help escalate it eventually an email came from meta telling her that the case was closed even though she was still unable to access her page in the end the matter was finally resolved for ms dean because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook and the team emailed that person daily for the four months finally i think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account says ms dean according to Jonas borchgrevink boss of us based cuber security firm hacked com ms dean is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook i would say that it is a massive problem says rm borchgrevink there are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages his company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts and he gets to clients per week but those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price because these cases can take up to six months to sort the BBC asked meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem and how it was tackling it but it declined however it said in a statement that we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details we also have a feature called security check up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure hackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons these including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts harvesting personal information spreading malware tricking people into sending money or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account the final thing in that list happened last year to David davit who is part of the marketing team at quantum windows doors a small family run business based in Washington state in the us he got locked out of the firm s social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from meta because his phone number was linked to the account that also fell into the hands of the scammers and soon after the lock out he got a whats app message demanding to unlock the account unable to find a helpline he searched on google but the number he rang put him through to more scammers that link has since been removed by google thankfully rm davit was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later rm borchgrevink believes that meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem it has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients so i don t think there s been a lot of change there he says in fact with scammers now utilizing AI to make their messages seem even more believable rm borchgrevink thinks the situation could get a lot worse he tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents they pretend to be meta support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way and that they need to verify themselves the messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable but when you start to verify your business page they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake meta site to steal log ins he said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first because all business accounts need to be linked to one your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account the scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror related or pornography related that disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account the BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked one small business which is part of franchise told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue tick verification as a result of that their account was flagged as a clone meanwhile others such as digital marketer hatchet serenade say that meta has wrongly closed business accounts last autumn he realized that a Facebook page he managed for a mobile bank had gone missing it had just disappeared he says there was no notification to me or any of the team members it was just gone it was like it had been kidnapped almost the page was a crucial gateway to customers across Europe for Lithuania bank myth rm serenade says that the customer support agents he spoke to at meta Facebook s owner were baffled he says they told him that they could see the page but that it had been restricted and that they could t unblock it six months later and the page remains locked meta tells the BBC that the page had been removed for violating its scams policies via a link on the page that was flagged by its systems as potentially harmful rm serenade disputes that the firm has ever posted any harmful or misleading content he says that meta needs to do more and move more quickly to help firms get their Facebook and Instagram pages back whether they have been a victim of fraud or not"

level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the us nations in south America breathed a sigh of relief ten of the states on the continent received the lowest level of only Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of and respectively before these were subsequently reduced to this came as trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for days the exceptions are china which has been hit with and Canada and Mexico which have still got tariffs on some e tongue sticking out rots to the us commentators who describe this as a win for south America argue that the higher us tariffs on china and on Canada and Mexico could make south American goods more attractive to us and global buyers while plausible this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that south America is also e tongue sticking out odes to here i ll set out this debate starting with the potential upsides for the region south America is rich in commodities its biggest economies Brazil and Argentina are major e tongue sticking out otters of soybeans and petroleum as well as in Brazil s case iron ore used in steel production the us s huge tariffs on Chinese goods and china s retaliatory on us imports may create opportunities for south American e tongue sticking out otters for example Brazil could increase agricultural e tongue sticking out rots to china to replace previous us supplies china is already Brazil s largest e tongue sticking out rot destination followed by the us there is a precedent when trump hit china with tariffs during his first term of office china shifted some commodity purchases from the us to Brazil boosting Brazilian soybean e tongue sticking out rots with the soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing some are hoping for a repeat these include freeloader d Avila a farmer and ex politician aligned with former Brazilian president bologna rm d Avila was also previously a senior figure at apropos a soybean producers group he tells the BBC that president trump s first term was excellent for Brazilian agriculture as trump s tariffs in that time favored us however Juan carols hall professor of international economics at the university of bluenose arise has a counterpoint he says that raising bilateral barriers on commodities mostly just affects who sells to whom and not financial gains for the sellers as the prices are set globally so his suggestion is that south American nations should t e tongue sticking out etc more financial gains from their commodities as a result of trump s actions just potentially different customers the prices are instead affected by macroeconomic factors for example if there is a recession he tells the BBC yet other sectors in south America are also hoping that trump s actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the us take the Brazilian beef industry the country s president Ruiz in<c3><a1>cio Lula DA Silva was recently in japan hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil s beef e tongue sticking out rots japan currently buys of its beef from the us but after trump initially threatened to hit the country with tariffs Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from south America other Brazilian industries such as coffee and footwear may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the us market Brazil is the world s biggest producer of coffee followed by Vietnam Indonesia and Colombia trump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of and Indonesia with while those higher rates are now on pause if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more e tongue sticking out endive in the us this would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the us where they are already the main suppliers meanwhile Brazil s shoemakers could see more e tongue sticking out rots to the us as a result of trump s high tariffs on Chinese e tongue sticking out rots currently china is the world s largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place the other three nations in the top five list of the world s largest footwear producers are India Vietnam and Indonesia the us initially gave India a higher tariff rate of Uruguay s new president yamand<c3><ba> horsier has also said that trump s tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and south America s bloc mercuric closer to reality he said that Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat in negotiations as it seeks to diversify trading partners you may have noted a lot of could and ifs that s not just because it is early days it s also because the pace and scale of us trade changes are causing wider instability whether the potential positives for south America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately which brings me to the risks for the continent firstly is still even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced us demand if prices rise this is more of a risk for imports that compete with us domestic production such as oil soybeans copper iron ore gold and lithium the us has also hit imports of aluminum and steel from all countries with tariffs of Brazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials bauxite and iron ore meanwhile Argentina has one of the largest aluminum producers in south America listed company altar and a smaller steel industry Argentine producers warn they may both lose us access and face more Chinese imports creating increased competition for domestic producers we re worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the us carols macaroon executive director of the Argentine steel chamber told the bluenose arise herald trump s tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility with oil and copper prices seeing slumps copper hit a month low at the start of April this volatility could hit the economies of Chile and pure where copper is the top e tongue sticking out rot Eduardo levy yeti a former chief economist at the central bank of Argentina says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a serious headwind for south America looking ahead rm yeti says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in e tongue sticking out rots to the us it could result in them getting higher tariffs from trump after all trump s aim is to boost domestic production not imports from other countries rm yeti says that trump may be equally displeased if south American nations start e tongue sticking out sorting more to china if Brazil fills in the us quota of goods e tongue sticking out rots to china the us may choose to punish Brazil he theories that trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce china s footprint in the region in return for favorable treatment china invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across central and south America so calling trump s tariffs a clear win or loss for south America oversimplifies a complex situation especially if trump announces in July that every country except china Canada and Mexico will continue at as rm hall says it s very hard to predict where this is going subject to this caveat he envisions a future where the us protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods but adds i m not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities there will be specific opportunities for sure but something that changes the game i don t think so"

from the us in January it was the first time he d stepped foot in Mexico since he was a baby born in the coastal resort of Acapulco his parents took him to the us when he was just six months old growing up in California he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life after his arrest in San Diego for gang activity Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as president trump was taking office and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth it was a shock it still is he admits when i got here to Mexico i really felt lost no family no food no clothes no nothing Alberto says he d almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish good thing i did t lose it completely because it s helped me to be bilingual he reflects in fact his language skills saved the year old from becoming destitute through a deportee support organization he heard that a local company ex call center was looking for English speakers the work as telephone sales agents sin t well paid but employees can earn commissions and the regular pay quench gave Alberto the stability he craved i had to do something to get back on my feet thanks to the call center now i have he tells me during a break between calls almost every agent at ex call center is a deportee including the company s owner denial Ruiz he was also born in Mexico and grew up in the us before being deported for low level drug crime in his early s denial says he can relate to his employees initial sense of disorientation in Mexico we are all dealing with culture shock he says over a steady hum of telephone calls we all have our life over there went to school over there were brought up on American culture have family over there we re from here but we re from over there too in their booths the agents work through long lists of us phone numbers some making promotional calls or sales others calling about debt collection and refinancing all the agents speak fluent English and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they re talking to people in Mexico rather than the us denial says that agents like Alberto who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the us but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico are among his most trusted employees they almost never have another mark on their criminal record and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs he e tongue sticking out liens denial Ruiz s own e tongue sticking out experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions as well as the telesales company he also co founded a humanitarian organization called the borderline crisis center which provides deportees with food shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico after his inauguration president trump said he would carry out what he calls the largest deportation in American history he has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from us soil and in the early days of his presidency immigration and customs enforcement ice agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California Mexican humanitarian organizations including the borderline crisis center braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees so far though one has t materialized there are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing the latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the us to Mexico were lower during the first three months of trump s second administration than they were for the same period last year Mexican president Claudia gumshoeing said that Mexico received almost deportees in February to April of which were Mexican this compares with for the same three months in however the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the us in the first place migrant encounters on the us southern border by us customs and border protection cap agents has dropped to their lowest level in years the threat of mass deportation combined with other factors from military deployments at the border to the high profile deportations of migrants to e Salvador may have acted as an effective deterrent the trump administration is also pushing the idea of self deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings still there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city the few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality beyond a smaller venture like ex call center a larger company called the American survey company or sac also relies on a deportee workforce with its sister company concentric sac has some call center stations in Tijuana where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys what happened in the us stays in the us laughs Nora ditz sac s chief happiness officer we don t really do background checks on that Nora says her job is focused on the employees well being to help them reintegrate we understand everyone has a past and we don t judge based on that we don t ask about it during our interview process we just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job she e tongue sticking out liens the don t ask don t tell policy at sac was invaluable to loos ulna s new start he grew up in orange country in California having been taken to the us when he was just a few months old unfortunately as a kid i made some bad choices joined a gang ran around with the wrong crowd cost me a lot cost me a life sentence i was a lifer in California state prison loos e tongue sticking out liens while in prison in California he enrolled for every educational programmer available and worked hard on his rehabilitation on release he was also sent back to Mexico in January just as trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech now years old and covered in gang related tattoos loos knew he would t get many more second chances in life i got no family over here my family is sac the people i met in my employment they re my family and my friends for loos the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime something he says ex gang members he knows in the us struggle with from the first day i did t feel any judgment at all i felt they just opened their arms and took me in i think i d be in the streets right now if it awns t for sac he adds while the trump administration s mass deportation programmer sin t yet at a level many in Mexico e tongue sticking out acted some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months if so deportees with gang pasts

strong aroma there s no familiar powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets the packet of biscuits or the caramel filled truffles and as i taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public i don t get quite the same burst of chocolate flavor that you might e tongue sticking out etc from treats with that familiar waxy light brown chocolate like coating the thing is this sin t chocolate it s made with sunflower seeds or fave also called broad beans the selection before me is just a smattering of the non cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now their makers have spied an opportunity partly because real chocolate prices are soaring the average increase in price for chocolate was over says Richard canes principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm mantel in January just gone it s shot up by that s the retail price of chocolate the wholesale price of the key ingredient cocoa which is made from fermented roasted and ground cacao beans has increased by an astonishing in i have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now i don t remember a big story like this on costs going up adds rm canes a key reason for this increase is climate change related weather impacts on cacao farms particularly in west Africa plus some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favor of illegal gold mining according to reports it means that there was a deficit of roughly tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year real chocolate could become a luxury item in the future says massif satin co founder and chief executive of Italian firm forever land which makes a cocoa powder alternative called chorus the company opened its production facility in march where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks carob trees produce small brown banana shaped pods containing seeds it s possible to process the pods to create a cocoa like powder this chocolate alternative has a long history however and not a very happy one a new corker article claims a generation was traumatized by carob based confectionery during the s it did t taste as good as real chocolate and it did t melt in your mouth in the same way apparently but rm satin insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product he acknowledges that carob really does t taste like chocolate but adds that forever land s fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavor to get it closer to cocoa their carob based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel like than real dark chocolate he e tongue sticking out liens there could be health benefits to this we can reduce drastically the sugar content says rm satin carob is also higher in fiber and lower in fat than cocoa German food manufacturer planet a foods has developed a different chocolate alternative tiara mar quart co founder and chief technology officer says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices unlike forever land planet a foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative chivalry we process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans e tongue sticking out liens rd mar quart it s a highly abundant ingredient there s millions and millions of tonnes on the market chivalry is now present in roughly different retail products mostly on the market in Germany and France though it also appears in mini egg shaped sweets sold by laid in the UK the sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate like coating containing chivalry when i try them the flavor is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg s core but the chocolate texture of the coating is impressive the same applies to chivalry covered biscuits made by the firm i note that the chocolate like coating is rather thin and not overly flavorful but again the texture is pretty much what you d e tongue sticking out etc from real chocolate though not quite as melt the company s chivalry covered popcorn is probably the most chocolate item i try the popcorn does t usurp its coating overall there s nothing here that would perturb a consumer especially one unaware that these products don t actually contain chocolate a UK start up also keen to compete in this space is nuke two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture we saw first hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain says Ross newton co founder like forever land and planet a foods nuke has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks but in nuke s case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fave beans there s around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year says rm newton it s early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year rm newton says imitating the flavor of real chocolate is very hard but that out of crucial flavor compounds in real chocolate his company s product manages to include of them though in some cases at slightly different concentrations the company sends me four caramel filled truffles to try the caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet but the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you d e tongue sticking out etc and very satisfying to chew anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste e tongue sticking out expectations says rm canes noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favorite chocolate containing products getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat he adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies the chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable should chocolate alternatives meet with success there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers says Tonya lander a lecturer in biology at oxford university it s something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives she says cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world nuke planet a foods and forever land all say they don t aim to replace chocolate rather the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls rd lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce the researchers report in a study published in February by shading cacao trees on plantations for example it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies such interventions besides switching to cocoa alternatives could help satisfy confectionery obsessed consumers in the coming years"

around the world could be plunged into recession but in Wednesday s announcement at the white house trump said the measures were necessary because countries were taking advantage of the us by imposing high tariffs and other trade barriers declaring a national emergency the republican president said the us had for more than five decades been looted pillaged raped and plundered by nations near and far both friend and foe alike it s our declaration of economic independence trump said in the rose garden against a backdrop of us flags the white house said the us would start charging the tariffs on April with the higher duties for certain nations starting on April today we are standing up for the American worker and we are finally putting America first trump said calling it one of the most

science fiction movie but Stephen chiseler is confident that one day his company will open a data center on the moon the way we see it is that by putting the data center in space you re really offering unparalleled security says the president of lodestar data holdings last month the Florida based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data center the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the moon on the Athena lunar lander from us space e tongue sticking out oration firm intuitive machines this in turn had been launched by a rocket from eon musk s space data centers are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites companies and governments lodestar says that putting them on the moon will offer customers secure reliable data processing while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them and while space based data centers may sound far fetched it s an idea that s really starting to take off part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on earth the ever e tongue sticking out sanding use of artificial intelligence AI computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world as a result the need for data centers has shot up too with annual demand set to rise between and by according to global management consultants McKinney new facilities are springing up all the time but it s getting hard to find places to put them data centers are large and sprawling and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling and increasingly local people don t want them built nearby putting data centers in space either in orbit around earth or on the moon the theory goes means they can t do quite so much harm there s more or less unlimited energy available from the sun for example and no neighbors to complain about the environmental impacts not only that space based data centers could specialist in services for spacecraft and other space facilities with space to space data transfers quicker than from the ground last summer a European commission funded feasibility study into orbiting data centers published its results the ascend report by carried out by Thales menial space a joint venture between french and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo published its results it determined that deploying data centers in space could transform the European digital landscape and be more Eco friendly Thales menial space envisages building a constellation of satellites measuring a combined m by m and with a total data processing power of around megawatts MW that s equivalent to a current medium sized ground based data center with some servers based on technologies that already exist or are under development the satellites would be assembled in orbit Damien dumpster ascend project architect at Thales menial space says that for space based data centers to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers times less missive over their life cycles he says this looks possible but in order to cover the new technology s developments and the production capacity ramp up to benefit from scale we have to consider larger system capacity around MW meaning of our envisaged large space infrastructures and launches he says the main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready depending on the investment and decisions to be taken this could be done for or meaning commercial viability before however despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology rd comedic vicinity associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin university in the UK says there are numerous big hurdles before space based data centers can be a viable proposition even with the contribution and advancements of companies like space launching hardware into orbit remains extremely e tongue sticking out endive he says each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars space based data centers would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect power and cool them all of which add up in weight and complexity cooling the equipment will be a particular problem because conventional cooling systems don t work well without gravity meanwhile space weather can damage electronics while the ever increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk rd vicinity adds and fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward even with robotics and automation there are limits to what can be repaired remotely a big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months yet firms like lodestar are supremely confident and say that they are responding to demand we would t be doing this if the customers were t asking us to says rm Scott its next target is to put a small data center in orbit around the moon in meanwhile other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster such as Washington state based star cloud which is due to launch a satellite based data center next month and start commercial operations in mid lodestar s rm elide says that space based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station it s like having the vaults at the back of the bank he says you don t have to open it every day but it s there to provide an extra measure of security and the distance from the earth to the moon offers that it s that much harder to hack that much harder to access the distance to the moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground this does t matter for some applications like longer term data storage and backups and meanwhile says lodestar founder and chief executive Chris stoat space based data centers can help organizations meet regulations about data sovereignty the need to hold peoples data in the country of origin under space law that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state it is an actual embassy in space he says lodestar already has customers lined up including the state of Florida and the isle

builder s helmet before opening the door to her kitchen inside it the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment because the kitchen is unusable Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid s hatch railway station have similar problems they say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts the current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here says Blanca which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time in order to have short term tourist flats or simply to hike up the rent Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners who were not available for comment for this article the tenancy contracts last five years during which time rent is fixed but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years for another home like this in this area i d have to pay double or more what i m paying now says Blanca it s not viable she and her neighbors are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiraling rental costs while salaries have increased by around over the past decade the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period there has been an increase over the last year alone according to figures provided by property portal idealists and housing has become Spaniards biggest worry it s also generating anger with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable on Saturday April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities a report by Spain s central bank found that nearly of families who rent now spend more than of their income on their accommodation the current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand says Juan vill<c3><a9>n of idealists demand is very good the economy is growing a lot but supply is dwindling very fast rm vill<c3><a9>n offers the example of Barcelona where rental increases have become notorious whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago that number has risen to rental costs during that time have increased by he adds we need to build more properties says rm vill<c3><a9>n and on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties or willing to buy properties refurbish them and put them on the rental market the central government has described the situation as a social emergency and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis last year the housing ministry estimated that the country needs between and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand this need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain s economic growth the ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing which at of total supply is among the lowest in Europe in at the height of a property ownership bubble more than homes were built in Spain but high building costs lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years with just under homes completed in the government has taken measures to incentive's construction apportioning land for the building of affordable homes while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market which has been a problem in the past but the socialist prime minister Pedro s<c3><a1>nchez has also e tongue sticking out dressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control at a recent event to mark the opening of low rent flats in the southern city of Seville he declared that Spaniards want us to act they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason of social justice not the law of the jungle they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like the central government and a number of local administrations have identified short term tourist accommodation as part of the problem last year the canary islands the Balearic islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers with their impact on rental costs the main complaint several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist flat permits while Barcelona is going further revoking the licenses of all of the city s or so registered short term apartments by the s<c3><a1>nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law which includes a cap on rentals in so called high tension areas where prices are climbing out of control political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the basque country Navarre and Catalonia and its success is open to debate the socialist led regional and central governments have pointed to a drop in rental costs in high tension areas of Catalonia since the cap s introduction there a year ago with Barcelona seeing a decrease of however critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market on the supply side the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords says rm vill<c3><a9>n even people that were doing build to rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don t want to get into the rental market another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to on properties bought by non residents from outside the EU on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited this is a measure that if rolled out would heavily affect British buyers the conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy handed with its approach however as public anger builds over this issue there are many others who would like the country s leaders to act much more stridently Gonzalo <c3><a1>lvarez of the indicator DE inquisitional e inquisitions an organization that campaigns for tenants rights agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem but insists that building more is not the answer there is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked on the one hand tourist flats and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks he says so there s no need to build more it s not necessary but the housing we have has been hijacked his organization wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent the central and local governments are not setting any limits says rm <c3><a1>lvarez so who is going to we will have to do it"

trump said if you look at that china first row that s tariffs charged to the USA including currency manipulation and trade barriers we are going to be charging them a discounted reciprocal tariff of

countries including Cambodia Vietnam and also it has slammed the door shut on how china rejigged its supply chains to get around the tariffs imposed on Beijing during trump s first term there were five Asian nations in the countries and territories hit with the highest tariffs trump has imposed new tariffs on Chinese imports since returning to the white house in January ratcheting up levies to in less than a week these tariffs will jump to apart from on products like cars steel and aluminum which will be subjected to lower tariffs Beijing has also been on the receiving end of other trump

removal of the exemption could force some Chinese firms to pass the extra cost on to customers making their goods less competitive in the us when taken together this is a worrying picture for Beijing said Deborah elms from the enrich foundation consultancy i don t think the new tariffs are necessarily aimed at china but when the united states stacks tariffs on top of each other specifically towards china the numbers become eye watering quite quickly china and the Chinese will have to retaliate they are not going to be able to sit back and watch this she said trump also imposed heavy tariffs ranging from to on Vietnam also and Cambodia this represents a full frontal assault on Beijing s extended supply chain said Stephen nines from investment firm psi asset management Vietnam and

efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city s heat production making the council s own vehicle fleet electric reducing energy usage in municipality owned buildings such as hospitals and schools and improving the city s poorest neighborhoods meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and for each godmother gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of or around kronor but miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount in and godmother managed to avoid a financial penalty but the newly released figures for show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy and so it is about to be fined kroner however this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement for electrifying the council s vehicles while it missed its improvement goal it did t do so by enough to be fined friedcake block portfolio manager at the city of

that we are making progress every year we want to show to the world how it is that these are the problems and these are the good things the improvements to the city s poorest areas and whether the council has hit its targets are measured by yearly resident surveys people are asked about their feelings towards an area s safety and cleanliness key initiatives have included making housing more secure introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like tallboy and gardening located in the north of the city they have high levels of crime and unemployment and large immigrant populations public housing agency fratricide which is ultimately owned by the city of godmother says it takes the improvement work very seriously for some of these vulnerable areas we actually own the majority of the housing says its research and development manager larch bankroll we are more or less the only official body in these areas there s no one else there only us i see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has because we have a lot of financial resources we are involved in everything but addendum wail a social

turned down potential till borrowers as the client s proposed targets were t ambitious enough yet he adds that tills are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one it s sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an till and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative he says you run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not

precedent for dealing with crimes of this kind at first sight orange and off white shards of rocks surrounded by dust and dirt are all you can see for thousands of desolate kilometers in the Atacama desert of Chile this is one of the driest places on earth looking around it feels impossible that any speck of life could survive but reaching out of nooks in the cracked crust along the desert s coast there lie thousands of cornucopia cacti a cactus group made up of more than species cornucopia are found only in Chile they grow a mere centimeter each year in scorching breathtaking desert conditions by absorbing the local evening fog known as cameraman these rare aubergine shaped succulents exemplify life s ability to adapt to extremes one of the traits that has made them highly sought after by plant collectors they be also just been at the heart of a landmark trial over an international cactus heist that might revolutionist how biodiversity crimes are dealt with the world over ranging from dark Grey to blueish green and from the size of a coin to that of a small car cornucopia have thick dark spines along their geometrical ridges their fluffy friars head flowers white yellow and sometimes orange once a year while they might look unassuming at first their beauty resilience and rarity have certainly not been lost on Andrea pirouette a well known personality in the Italian plant world pirouette has been cactus collector and trader for decades and is said to take great pride in his unique knowledge of the realm his Facebook profile picture is a rugged backpack sitting on top of a cluster of cacti in the field his whats app status reads the king of the cactus pirates he s been spotted clad in a jacket with the king of Chile printed on its back when called on his mobile number for this story though he refused to comment and hung up without saying a word his lawyers were also contacted but refused to comment in customs at McMillan maleness airport

boxes of cacti at his home and the home of a friend in a town nearby the team s botany e tongue sticking out err was able to rapidly identify the cacti were cornucopia many of older than pirouette

barricaded himself for about minutes says zucchini police did not find the rare sapling there but once they gained entry what they found started a much more interesting case says zucchini more than cornucopia cacti sat on pirouette s veranda and in another locked room that he initially told police he d lost the key for together with other rare cacti it was by chance says zucchini of the discovery pirouette also said he d lost his passport but police soon found it had been slid on top of his wardrobe he d maybe thrown it there in a rush says zucchini the document confirmed he d visited Chile five times between and records found on his laptop and mobile helped police identify a close local accomplice matting crescent as well as a network of other illegal plant traders and regular buyers the plants were usually sold online through specialized auction websites and bought by people with private ornamental collections all over the world crescent posted his cactus on an Instagram account called cactus Italy a Japanese buyer who works in the fashion industry for instance had been sending pirouette sums of each month pirouette was also buying plants himself for hundreds of dollars the stolen plants discovered on that day were valued by the police at higher than m m pictures of the crime scene were sent for plant identification including to fabricator who is local cactus e tongue sticking out err these were incredible plants they were ancient plants hundreds of years old says fabricator pirouette is known for having a keen selective eye for high quality specimens and precise collective methods fabricator says they were perfect forensic botanists from the botanical garden of Milan ran soil analyses to confirm that about cornucopia plants had been illicitly extracted straight from the Atacama desert and several hundred smaller juvenile plants had been grown and propagated from seeds collected during those extirpation stints while seed collecting in the wild is not illegal in Chile removing and e tongue sticking out sorting plants without proper documentation is in Italy importing plants into the country without documentation is illegal while cornucopia are also protected under the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites the cacti had been shipped from Chile to Greece and Romania then to Italy another seizure in November found more illegally traded cacti from the united states Mexico and Argentina the case was dubbed operation Atacama and has become known as one of the largest illegal cactus operations to date in Europe as a result the Italian government initiated a new prosecution against pirouette and his accomplice in for breaking the cites convention the ensuing five year trial which ended in January resulted in many firsts in the history of biodiversity crimes for one after being seized by the police about of the stolen cornucopia were sent back to Chile this is biodiversity patrimony and it should go back to Chile it awns t even a question for me what should have been done with the plants says Barbara kitsch co chair of the induct sac cactus and succulent plants specialist group she helped design a protocol for the plants to be safely repatriated quarantined and safeguarded i don t know of any other case where plants have been sent back to their country says kitsch i think it was definitely a success the cacti are now in an Atacama desert greenhouse managed by the national forest corporation of Chile corona although some local reports suggest some of the plants may have gone missing corona did not respond to a request for comment about their status and said it could not grant the BBC access to the greenhouse until April despite their extreme resilience having survived trips to the other side of the world and back the confiscated plants will never truly return home they cannot be reintroduced into the wild as there are no records of which areas they came from in the first place they will likely be used for genetic and botanical research and propagation e tongue sticking out experiments in the meantime kitsch s team has developed the nation s first cornucopia conservation action plan to strategies future safeguarding efforts in the wild set for official publication in march after hours of walking in the Atacama desert it becomes almost difficult to breathe yet Mauricio Gonzalez and Rodrigo Castillo two middle aged men each with a slight limp in their walk are climbing the huge desert hills questing for their beloved cornucopia this one is maybe years old Gonzalez says pointing at a girth cactus leaning crooked to the left sprouting out of a crack in the chapped land Gonzalez and Castillo are part of the contaminates led desertion desert walkers a group of volunteer educators who spread awareness of desert flora and fauna in the Chilean region of Antofagasta cornucopia is one of their favorite cacti to encounter they be evolved over years and years and years to adapt to this territory says Gonzalez the president of the group pirouette is far from the only cactus connoisseur with an interest in these rare succulents the contaminates say many less e tongue sticking out experienced locals get contracted online by international collectors and get sent to rob the cornucopia in bulk they can end up eradicating any and all plants they find along the way often leaving some uprooted ones on the path behind them at least three or four times a year the contaminates find some of their favorite trails have been wiped out completely whenever they post a picture from one of their walks they field hundreds of ill intention ed messages on social media there are trends this year cornucopia attachments is the most fashionable says Gonzalez whose usual trail includes sightings of the species attachments incinerate and the rarer solaria we see it very clearly once somebody has it everybody else wants to have it too sometimes the volunteers hide their favorite plants under rock slates to conceal them from potential poachers since the cacti tend to have highly localized endemics with small populations found only in specific sites poachers can wipe out a whole species with a couple of flicks of a chisel they say an increase in road construction and irregular housing has allowed more and more people to access the harsh and secluded desert habitat where cornucopia live you open the window for poaching says Pablo Guerrero a cactus researcher at the universalized DE conceptualization in Chile social media has also made it easier for collectors to find each other while regulation and enforcement are much slower to catch up most countries in the world are very naive in the face of this kind of poaching says Guerrero they say they re plants who cares they re cacti they all look the same poaching is not the only threat facing cornucopia most of the cacti we encounter on this daytime e tongue sticking out edition are dying they are shriveling up collapsing onto themselves and turning black like ash due to the desert s rising temperatures fluctuations in rainfall patterns and rapid changes in moisture patterns along the coast the cameraman fog is changing trajectory and cornucopia is now becoming a legacy of millennia when the environment was different from today s changes in land use and the e tongue sticking out anion of the local mining industry also pose a threat to the plants the contaminates organist yearly cactus watering tours but it s little in the face of the desert s extended droughts yeah this one is dying says Castillo nudging a dark deflated sack of spines this one too research by the scientists Guerrero and kitsch found that of all cornucopia species are endangered due to climate change and illegal trafficking they are in very rapid decline says Guerrero some will go extinct in the wild soon it is very dramatic the raid and ensuing court case did t stop pirouette in September while still pending judgment in Italy he flew to Chile one more time he was arrested at the airport upon landing in Santiago as he was now also wanted for illegal wildlife trafficking in Chile zucchini says a Chilean prosecutor reached out to him personally on whats app after hearing about the repatriation of the smuggled cacti in February and as a result he initiated a case against pirouette the collector underwent a fast tracked trial in an Atacama court and Chilean authorities fined him pesos and banned him from entering the country for years such ban from the country is likely the most effective deterrent from future smuggling zucchini says on January the Italian court issued a first instance decision seen by the BBC against crescent and pirouette it sentenced pirouette to months imprisonment and a fine of and crescent to months imprisonment and a fine of the verdict was published on February and the defendants now have days to appeal for biodiversity e tongue sticking out erst though the court case also produced another ground breaking outcome the court recognized that pirouette s crime awns t just against the law it was against nature the cactus conservation organization association per la diversification e la skua conservation ABC founded by fabricator was included in the case as an affected civil party pirouette and his accomplice now have to pay an additional in civil remedies to ABC as reparations for the damage done to their conservation work the funds will be directly invested into cacti research awareness and conservation according to fabricator we re giving to plants a right a right to not be destroyed because they are beings says fabricator more like this the bewildered golf courses teeming with life why some animals thrive on being alone the farmers protecting penal s snow leopards too often nature itself does t get any justice in crimes against biodiversity says Jacob Phelps a lecturer in tropical environmental change and policy at Lancaster university and co founder of the biodiversity law organization conservation litigation org which consulted on the case the

up with metrical s law e tongue sticking out liens Evan prodigious co author and current editor of activity pub another open social media architecture which is behind popular platforms like meta s threads the law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users that means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones they can use those

rivals abbot Detroit acme Adams and caroler no well that is hardly surprising because unlike ford they all went bust very early on and they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter a we only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world s motor industry and the current high tech sector is much the same a great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money only a few picked ford or Chrysler which is almost exactly what is happening now only to the tech sector tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year as has been widely reported with share price graphs often looking like roller coaster rides even before president trump s tariffs have caused wider stocks falls a principle reason for this tech sector volatility according to Elroy damson professor of finance at the university of Cambridge is that like the once nascent car industry we don t know which tech firms will win in the long run if you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference says prof damson but almost every company went bankrupt you did t know which company you should be buying then of course not all high tech businesses are making money the measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors the growth in profits or dividends and the growth in the value of the shares boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value but many high tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends instead they are investing in future growth and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits as hosanna street er head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves landowner puts it tech shares are more volatile they have high valuations and their price earnings ratios are very high and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements but also investors in such shares are as ms street er puts it gambling on not jam today but jam tomorrow they are all trying to pick the next future big winner not the one paying out profits now but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future so any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously e tongue sticking out acted means share values can collapse on the other hand any good news boosts share prices even if current profits or even losses don t change at all as investors pile into what they think is the future winner the shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends that means as prof damson puts it that small changes in growth e tongue sticking out expectation can lead to large changes in share value which can effect a large number of companies at the same time you have companies that are reasonably similar so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way he says this is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the s there were companies with huge growth prospects and when the growth prospects disappeared these were the companies that disappeared also even today there are not that many really large high tech companies in America they are colloquially known as the magnificent seven NVIDIA a chip maker alphabet which owns google amazon apple Microsoft meta the parent of Facebook and teals so it does not take much to spook the market especially since several of these firms are really quite young and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned anyone remember ergonomics boo or Compaq technology unlike say steel production or food manufacturing is changing at a very rapid rate and there is obviously the chance that a new high tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals there is simply no guarantee that today s magnificent seven will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms take teals for example its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely reported factors firstly some potential customers are opposed to teals owner eon musk s involvement in president trump s government and secondly Chinese electric car firms such as bud are increasingly strong competitors meanwhile NVIDIA saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chat bot deep seek this app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals the instant popularity of deep seek has raised questions about the future of America s AI dominance and the scale of investments us firms are planning this concerns NVIDIA because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing AI is now the biggest tech game in town and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry their products and their profits they can t all be right or as prof demon puts it at least in you knew what automobiles did but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd and for AI companies that sin t good enough and not all AI firms can win adds Robert whale professor of finance at Vanderbilt university in Tennessee AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility the race is on that means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions and any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors most of whom don t understand the subject abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead then there are investors who seemingly don t seem to care which companies shares they buy so long as they are in the booming high tech sector as they are speculating and spreading their risks in short share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm s value especially in the high tech sector or even of its prospects instead they can represent the optimism of investors and optimism does not always last it is often short lived passing and faddish and sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away it is in short volatile"

for Donald trump s so called liberation day in America next week the us president s deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners will come just days after he hit foreign carmakers with import taxes Vietnam could be particularly vulnerable to trump s latest salvo of levies it has a large trade deficit with the us and has been a beneficiary of firms moving factories out of china to avoid measures announced during his first term in office while some countries have hit back at Washington Vietnam s prime minister ham min chin has suggested that he may take a more diplomatic approach speaking in January he said he was willing to visit trump s mar a lag home in Florida and golf all day long if it benefits his country drawing laughter in the room and that idea may not be too far fetched the trump organization is planning to invest billions of dollars in golf courses hotels and real estate in Vietnam according to the Reuters news agency the first project will reportedly be a residential complex with three hole golf courses which will break ground in may the BBC has contacted the company and its Vietnamese partner for comment but could golf diplomacy really work trump has previously said Vietnam was worse than china and almost the single worst abuser of anybody but he has not yet specifically targeted Vietnam with tariffs even though it has the third largest trade deficit with the us after china and Mexico analysts say Vietnam is doing well at engaging with Washington but its efforts may still not be enough to avoid most of trump s tariff plans

us trade negotiator i would not however e tongue sticking out etc any special treatment of Vietnam from a policy point of view personal relationships are important to trump but in this case i believe

careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non cooperation on trade issues this strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach known as bamboo diplomacy like shoots of plants that sway with the wind Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures if the us were to increase pressure on Vietnam the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries undertake advanced machinery purchases and capturing the moment consider access to Vietnam s rare earth minerals rm Norris said one big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about china s influence Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of us china tensions during trump s first term in he hit china with tariffs causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam this has led to an increase of e tongue sticking out rots from Vietnam to the us with Chinese companies that have moved production there

rot market china is its largest supplier of goods accounting for more than a third of imports according to the latest official data Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year these are huge red flags for trump my e tongue sticking out expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs rm Olson said however tariffs on

it must reduce its trade surplus over time and combat the trans shipment of Chinese goods through the country rm Norris said Vietnam s prime minister has said he is confident that his administration can handle the relationship with the us now that the south east Asian nation has cut some tariffs on us goods they may be more attractive to Vietnamese consumers increasing America s share of trade

members told them one thing and done another a year after pairs set a milestone as the first Olympics to achieve full gender parity Coventry s triumph sends a powerful message up until there were no female members of the soc and Coventry is only the second woman to run for the presidency her background and relative youth also helps the soc project a progressive and diverse image at a time when it is trying to ensure the games remain relevant to younger generations as well as being a seven time Olympic medalist and competing at five games Coventry has been an soc member since where she has held a number of significant roles but the nature of her victory despite a low key campaign has led to questions over how it was achieved soc insiders that BBC sport spoke to at the luxury resort of coats

lobbying on her behalf and insisted that the process had been fair on Friday he said he was very much relieved to see the result of the vote calling it a demonstration of the soc as a global organization with the highest good governance standards whatever the reality Coventry s success has been widely portrayed as a win for continuity and patronage at the soc and for her long time mentor

Question at heart of Caribbean legal dispute","2025-03-24","Jacob Evans","Business reporterâ¢@__jacobevans","rum is a key part of Jamaica s cultural identity but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican that question is at the center of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can and cannot be called Jamaica rum in October of last year Jamaica s intellectual property office IPO approved amendments to the geographical indication GI designation for Jamaica rum that was originally set up in the biggest change is that aging the rum overseas is now prohibited the amendment was called for by the spirits pool association spa the trade organization that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica s six rum distilleries Appleton and new motormouth which are owned by j wary and nephew Clarendon hampered estate long pond and worthy park estate the spew s argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognized in its two key e tongue sticking out rot markets the EU and the us it says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors and lead to more drinkers recognizing it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location but the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business this company national rums of Jamaica NR owns long pond and Clarendon NR is comprised of three shareholders the government of Jamaica emerald distillers of Guyana and the Barbados based west indies rum distillery word the key factor is that word has since been owned by french spirits firm mason errand its business model relies heavily on e tongue sticking out sorting rum in bulk and aging overseas something not allowed under Jamaica s new GI it argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum and that the island has e tongue sticking out sorted and aged rum abroad for centuries and so the NR is appealing the ruling of IPO with a hearing scheduled for April the spirits pool association says that word only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by mason deferral what we re saying is if you truly believe in Jamaica rum age it in Jamaica says Christopher gentles general manager of the spa rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses the thick treacle like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants rm gentles says that aging the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness and so he adds that we were a little bit puzzled by the NR s objection the spa also points out that e tongue sticking out sorting and aging spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value added processes like refining bottling labeling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism both the NR and mason deferral declined to comment the use of guys makes a product distinctive and opens up three potential sources of value according to deb gangrene professor of intellectual property law at the university of oxford the first is simply a price premium research shows products can charge a price that is to times more than standard this sin t always reflected in profit as GI products are often more e tongue sticking out endive to make he adds the second reason is they anchor production in that region this stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value like cheddar cheese which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by word for a generalized type of cheese lastly prof gangrene says guys help to advertise the region and opens up other aspects of history and geography citing France s successful wine tourism industry examples of successful and longstanding guys are scotch whisk champagne and para ham another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados currently the island does t have a scheme Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI the sole objector was word which owns brands such as cock spur similarly to the situation in Jamaica it objects to the proposed rules against aging overseas the failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers including Richard lease owner of the island s foursquare distillery we need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here tied here that cannot be separated from here he says back in Jamaica the spa wants the country s rum to apply for the EU s protected geographical indication classification but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the IPO have concluded rm gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached even if it means that both sides are not totally happy it is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us he says and while the spa hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica s history in the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper the gleaner endorsed the IPO decision saying there were many examples of firms with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island s brand it concluded when foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand"

disturbing our signal we can measure this disturbance multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic sea have raised alarm in recent months so important are these cables which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries that NATO has launched a mission called Baltic sentry to patrol the Baltic sea with aircraft warships and drones the EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once so some companies are trying to monitor what s going on in the vicinity of any cable by using fiber optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed it was during tests of AP sensing s system last year not a real attempt at sabotage that the diver patted his hand on the subset cable watched over by the firm the company also deployed ships drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles and the team tested whether their cable could hear a vessel plunging its anchor into the water when pulses of light travel along a fiber

revealing disturbances in the fiber optic signal the footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge with this technology it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subset cable as well as its location and in some circumstances its direction of travel that could be correlated with satellite imagery or even automatic identification system sis records which most ships broadcast at all times it is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fiber optic cables if one unused dark fiber is available or a lit fiber with enough free channels the firm adds there are limitations however David Webb at Aston university says that fiber optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away and you need to install signal listening devices or interrogators every km miles or so along a cable AP sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of meters away but usually not several kilometers away the company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the north sea though declines to comment further people really need an early warning in order to determine what to do says Paul Leiden chief executive of optics a dutch firm that also makes fiber optic acoustic sensing systems rm Leiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful one might place such listening cables say km from a vital port or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable rather than within those assets themselves that could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset optics s fiber optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines rm Leiden adds and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic sea demand for fiber optic sensing technology is growing says Douglas plague at via vi solutions a network testing and measurement company we do see the number of requests increasing some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company electronica says christian pries head of central Europe middle east Africa and submarine cable business at the firm acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that rm pries suggests will become more common in the future but there s relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage in terms of physical strengthening today s fiber optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibers he says there is also armory wire thick metal cords running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords on the UK side of the channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing you want to have it double armored says rm pries but should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double armored cable it will almost certainly still damage it rm pries says such is the force of the collision or pulling action while it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection this might become prohibitively e tongue sticking out endive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen meters cables break all the time says lane burden research analyst at telephotography a telecommutes market research firm the number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years she adds e tongue sticking out nailing that the faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subset cables being installed during that period ms burden also notes that even when a cable is severed telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them meaning that end users often don t notice much disruption to their service still the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic sea is welcome says shorten banner co founder and director of the global public policy institute a think tank it s good that NATO and the European union have woken up and while cable sensing technology might be useful its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react the question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel says banner"

rival services in December us car giant general motors closed down its self driving car subsidiary cruise gm attributed the change of strategy to the considerable time and resources that would be

NVIDIA and eon musk s teals way mo is the leading us player though it already operates self driving taxis in phoenix San Francisco loci Angeles and Austin taxes and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami Florida so why has way mo succeeded where other efforts at least in the us have failed three things people money and process says Sven baker a lecturer at Stanford graduate school of

it has the financial weight of google owner alphabet behind it and has become thorough in its approach they be come around to really playing by the book to be a good steward of processes working with

Ben is a staunch electric car advocate he runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK yet now he says the model y has to go because he disapproves vehemently of teals CEO eon musk s actions especially the way he has handled firing us government employees i m not a fan of polarization or of doing things without kindness he says there are ways of doing things that don t ostracism people or belittle them i don t like belittlement Ben is part of a wider backlash against the teals boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks since musk was appointed head of the controversial department for government efficiency doge charged with taking an ace to federal government spending musk has also intervened in politics abroad making a video appearance at a rally for the far right party alternative f<c3><bc>r clandestine ahead of Germany s parliamentary election as well as launching online attacks on British politicians including prime minister heir smarter for some who do not share his views it has all become too much there have been protests outside dozens of teals dealerships not only in the us but also in Canada the UK Germany and Portugal although most of them have been peaceful there have been cases of showrooms charging stations and vehicles being vandalized in separate incidents in France and Germany several cars were set on fire in the us the teals cyberpunk an angular metallic pickup truck appears to have become a particular magnet for anti musk sentiment a number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps us president Donald trump was quick to show his support to teals by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the white house and pledging to buy one he said violence against us showrooms should be treated as domestic terrorism musk has also been unequivocal in his response this level of violence is insane and deeply wrong he said in a recent interview with fox news teals just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks what is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on teals as a business and the extent to which musk s views and involvement in the trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers and if that is the case can teals really build on its past success with musk remaining at the helm two decades ago teals was a tiny silicon valley start up with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionizing the motor industry today it is the best selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market with giant factories around the world it is also widely credited with having proven that es could be fast powerful fun and practical musk the figurehead of the company has driven this all forward since he joined teals in as its chairman and principal finder he became chief executive four years later and has held that role throughout the company s rise to prominence teals was the pioneer says Stephanie Valdez treaty director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm cox automotive they kind of got es into the mainstream got other manufacturers to start investing and really created a lot of awareness it is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow uninspiring and impractical with minimal range between charges the teals model s which went on sale in had sports car performance and a range of more than miles it played a key role in changing perceptions and provided a springboard for rapid growth nowadays teals is not just a producer of electric vehicles it has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems with the goal of building fleets of driver less robot axis it also has a fast growing energy storage business and is developing a general purpose humanoid robot known as optimums like the late Steve jobs at apple musk became the embodiment of his brand ever present as the front man at company events and product launches with a devoted following among e enthusiasts but recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views amplifying them through his own social network x at the same time teals itself has been facing mounting challenges although its model y was the best selling car worldwide last year overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade dropping from million to million the decline was relatively small and teals retained its position as the world s best selling maker of electric vehicles but for a growth focused business it raised alarm bells profits for the year were also down this year has also begun badly notably in Europe where there was a fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in there were further falls in major European markets in February although the UK was an outlier with sales rising as well as in Australia meanwhile shipments of teals s Chinese made cars which are produced for sale both in china and abroad fell more than in the same month in early march Joseph soak wall street analyst at swiz bank UBS published a research note in which he predicted a decline in teals s worldwide sales this year of that forecast which countered market e tongue sticking out expectations of growth helped to send teals s share price tumbling it fell in a single day adding to an overall decline of since the start of the year sales can fall for many reasons and people within teals have suggested that a drop in sales was to be e tongue sticking out acted as the company geared up for the launch of the new model y with potential customers holding off for the latest version but research by brand monitoring firm morning consult intelligence suggests musk s activities have indeed harmed teals particularly in the EU and Canada although not in china which remains one of its biggest markets in the us it says the situation is more nuanced with many consumers approving of doge cuts in government spending however it adds musk may be turning off those us consumers most likely to buy a teals among high income consumers who say they plan to purchase an e in the future teals now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago teals did not respond to the BBC s questions concerning its fall in sales but e tongue sticking out erst believe teals s problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO to start with the current model range which was once cutting edge now looks uninspiring the once ground breaking model s has been on sale since the model x since even the more recent and more affordable model and model y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market if you look at their product line up they haven t had any fresh models recently except for the cyberpunk which is really niche says ms Valdez treaty they be had a refresh of the model y but it s not a big splash and there s so much more competition out there prof peter wells director of Cardiff university s center for automotive industry research makes a similar point we be not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps eon musk should have been looking for i think that is a big part of their problem competition comes from a number of directions traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards e production with the likes of chorea s KIA and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery powered cars at the same time an array of new e brands has emerged from china they include the likes of bud which has e tongue sticking out sanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices as well as the more upmarket tongue sticking out neg and bio which have focused on luxury and advanced technology china has amazing incentives and subsidies for es says ms Valdez treaty you can see how Chinese firms especially bud continue to grow not only in china but in other parts of the world so that definitely is a huge threat not just for teals but for other manufacturers as well the extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid march when bud announced it had developed an ultra fast charging system that would provide a car with miles of range in just five minutes significantly faster than teals s own supercharger network musk s comments during teals s earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere particularly in driver less vehicles in January he claimed teals would have a robotic service operating in taxes by June but this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time in for example he said that within a year there would be a million slates on the road capable of acting as robot axis meanwhile teals s full self driving package available to teals buyers remains a hands on system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times every year we get a new promise from eon musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner the trouble is they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from says jay finagle of automotive consultancy red spy arguably teals needs strong leadership right now but regardless of his politics the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates he owns or runs an array of other businesses notably his social media platform x the artificial intelligence firm xi and the private space firm space which has e tongue sticking out experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant star ship rocket asked in a recent interview with fox business how he was combining all of this with his new government role musk responded with great difficulty it s hard to tell exactly how much teals is hands on managed nowadays by musk says prof wells if he s making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth then those decisions have to be correct and i think you need someone with a hands on commitment to understanding the automotive industry and making those decisions correctly ever since he joined teals in eon musk s position has been unassailable there is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing he remains the company s largest single shareholder with a stake currently worth more than b that is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants vanguard and black rock while a number of other financial institutions including state street bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes for those investors the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading but it is still almost higher than it was a year ago in fact the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election which almost doubled teals s market valuation today teals is still valued at more than times its earnings a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as ford general motors or Toyota which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth teals is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles which is clearly not going to happen given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers or that is going to dominate robot axis and autonomous vehicles says rm finagle none of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment although in media interviews this week one long term shareholder turned vocal critic the investment fund manager Ross Gerber did call for rm musk to step down but analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top a new CEO for teals would without question be the best thing for the company right now says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt automotive research it would address the toxic contagion from musk offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his doge position and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand i think that s the clear direction of travel at the moment says

be worth it they re e tongue sticking out experienced astronauts but they will feel fantastic to be back on earth the fresh air is the first thing that gets you she told BBC news the saga of butch and sun began in June they were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the star liner spacecraft developed by aerospace company Boeing but the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home star liner returned safely to earth empty in early September but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return so NASA opted for the next scheduled flight a space capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September it flew with two astronauts instead of four leaving two seats spare for butch and sun s return the only catch was this had a planned six month mission extending the astronauts stay until now the arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for butch and sun s return and after a short hand over with the new team their mission is now at an end the NASA pair have embraced their longer than e tongue sticking out acted stay in space they be carried out an array of e tongue sticking out experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks with sun breaking the record for the woman who s spent the most hours outside of the space station and despite the astronauts being described as stranded they never really were throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them and the rest of those onboard home if there was an emergency speaking in the weeks before their departure butch Gilmore said they were t fazed when their mission was extended we came up prepared to stay long even though we plan to stay short that s what we do in human space flight that s what your nation s human space flight programmer is all about he said sun added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission i think just the fact that we re living up here in this very unique place gives you an amazing perspective she said i don t want to lose that spark of inspiration when i leave so i m going to have to bottle it somehow the pair s mission attracted even more publicity last month after space CEO eon musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons and his company could have brought them home sooner but NASA officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station s needs Garrett Heisman a former NASA astronaut and former director of space operations at space said there were good reasons why NASA did t opt for a dedicated rescue mission it awns t going to reduce the amount of time that butch and sun spent in space by very much i mean you d shave a couple of months off so the benefit awns t that great he told BBC news and the cost was high these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars i think butch and sun would have been the first

of consecutive days was extended in march after the spacecraft he and his cremates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak he eventually came home in October the extra months in space

record for the longest cumulative time in space a total of days in orbit nonentity and chub traveled more than million miles during their orbits of the earth in the latest mission to the ISS but spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams rubbish s own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present he is the first astronaut to participate in a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body while the results have yet to be published it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to e tongue sticking out lore deeper into the solar system a return journey to mars for example is e tongue sticking out acted to take around days just over three years under current plans the spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed but problems keeping fit aside just what does spaceflight do to the human body muscles and bones without the constant tug of gravity on our limbs muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space the most affected are those muscles that help to maintain our posture in our back neck calves and quadriceps in micro gravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy after just two weeks muscle mass can fall by as much as and on longer missions of three to six months it can fall by similarly because astronauts are not putting their skeletons through as much mechanical strain as they do when subject to earth s gravity their bones also start to miserliness and lose strength astronauts can lose of their bone mass every month they spend in space and up to over a six month period on earth older men and women lose bone mass at a rate of every year this can increase their risk of suffering fractures and increase the amount of time it takes to heal it can take up to four years for their bone mass to return to normal after returning to earth to combat this astronauts undertake hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS this includes a series of squats dead lifts rows and bench presses using a resistivity exercise device installed in the ISS s gym alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike they also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible a recent study however highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size it recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss the lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly this can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on earth during a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to earth rubbish himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening i think my spine has extended just enough that i m kind of wedged into my seat liner so i should t move much at all he said weight loss although weight means very little while in orbit the micro gravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely including human bodies maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit although NASA tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station it can still affect an astronaut s body Scott Kelly a NASA astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for days while his twin brother

becomes messed up although the body does adapt somewhat and blood can accumulate in the head more than it normally would some of this fluid can pool at the back of the eye and around the optic nerve leading to edema this can lead to changes in vision such as decreased sharpness and structural changes in the eye itself these changes can start to occur after just two weeks in space but as that time goes on the risk increases some of the vision changes reverse within about a year of astronauts returning to earth but others can be permanent e tongue sticking out sure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems the earth s atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS this protection disappears while spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves neural shuffling after his long stay on the ISS however Kelly s cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother s on the ground however researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly s cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed possibly as his brain readjusted to the earth s gravity and his very different lifestyle back home a study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent days on the ISS in also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit it found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function in other words movement and also in the vestibule cortex which plays an important role in orientation balance and perception of our own motion this is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down a more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long term space missions cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles responsible for storing cerebrovascular fluid providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size friendly bacteria it is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorganisms that live in and on our bodies this macrobiotic can influence how we digest food affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work researchers examining Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space this is perhaps not entirely surprising given the very different food he was eating and the change in the people he spent his days with we obtain a horrifying amount of gut and oral microorganisms from the people we live alongside but e tongue sticking out sure to radiation and the use of recycled water along with changes to his physical activity could all also have played a role find out more about how exercise affects your gut microbes skin although there have now been five NASA astronauts who have spent more than days in orbit we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit his skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint genes one of the most significant findings from Kelly s prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA at the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as milometers which are thought to help protect our genes from damage as we age these get shorter but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these milometers most striking however was the finding of significantly longer milometers during spaceflight says Susan bailey a professor of environmental and radio logical health at Colorado state university who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother she has done separate studies with another unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months also rune tongue sticking out acted was that milometer length shortened rapidly on return to earth for all crew members of particular relevance to long term health and aging trajectories astronauts in general had many more short milometers after spaceflight than they did before exactly why this happens is still being unraveled she says we have some clues but additional long duration crew members like rubbish who spent one year in space will be critical to really characterizing and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes one possible cause could be e tongue sticking out sure to the complex mix of radiation while in space astronauts who e tongue sticking out experience long term e tongue sticking out sure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage she says there were also some changes in gene e

response to DNA damage bone formation and the immune system s response to stress most of these changes however had returned to normal within six months of his return to earth in June a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight using gene e tongue sticking out session data from samples obtained from the crew of the space inspiration mission who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of it identified changes in proteins related to the immune system aging and muscle growth comparing their gene activity to those of other astronauts on previous missions the study found in the e tongue sticking out session of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight the men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to earth in particular the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body and interleukin which is produced to glued immune cells to sites of infection were more affected in the men compared to the women another protein called carcinogen which is involved in blood clotting was also affected more in male astronauts but the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight but it could be related to their response to stress you can hear NASA astronaut Peggy whit son describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below with an accumulated days in space she has spent more time in orbit than any other American although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut loge nonentity who has clocked up days in space immune system Kelly received a series of vaccines before during and after his trip into space and his immune system was found to react normally but bailey s research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit there are still many questions to be answered however about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal big brained species that evolved to live on earth as researchers pour over rubbish s

also responded with countermeasures in an escalation of the wider trade war sir heir said the UK was taking a pragmatic approach and was pushing for a trade deal but opposition politicians called for

they charge us or or or or then that s what we re charging them he said the us president said he was not happy with EU trade policies citing concerns about legal penalties it has imposed on apple and

large Filipino diaspora there the much talked about warrant for his arrest from the international criminal court ICC was it turned out already in the hands of the Philippines government which moved swiftly to execute it a frail looking rm duster walking with a stick was moved to an air force base within the airport perimeter a chartered jet was quickly prepared to take him to the ICC in the Hague how had this happened how had a man so powerful and popular often called the trump of Asia been brought so low in vain his lawyers and family members protested that the arrest had no legal basis and complained that duster s frail health was being neglected while in office rm duster formed an alliance with the macros family the children of ousted dictator Ferdinand macros who had long been working on a political comeback rm duster could not run again in the election but his daughter tiara mayor of southern city of Davao was also popular and a strong contender to replace him however Ferdinand macros s son bong bong who had been in politics all his life was also well placed to win and very well funded the two families struck a deal they would work together to get bong bong into the presidency and tiara into the vice presidency on the assumption that come the next election in her turn would come and she would have the formidable macros machine behind her it worked both won their positions by a wide margin rm duster e tongue sticking out acted that his alliance would protect him from any blow back over his controversial presidency once he was out of power the most serious threat hanging over him was an investigation by the ICC into his culpability for thousands of extrajudicial killings carried out during anti drugs campaigns he ordered after he became president in but also during his tenure as mayor of the southern city of Davao from rm duster withdrew the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the ICC in but its prosecutors argued they still had a mandate to look into alleged crimes against humanity committed before that and launched a formal investigation in however president macros initially stated that his government would not co operate with the ICC that position only changed after the dramatic breakdown of the duster macros alliance strains in their relationship were evident from the earliest days of the administration when tiara duster s request to be given control of the powerful defense ministry was turned down and she was given the education ministry instead president macros also distanced himself from his predecessor s mercurial policies mending fences with the us standing up to china in contested seas and stopping the blood curdling threats of retribution against drug dealers in the end these were two ambitious power hungry clans aiming to dominate Filipino politics and there was not enough power for them to share relations reached a nadir last year when tiara duster announced that she had hired an assassin to kill president macros should anything happen to her late last year the lower house of congress which is controlled by macros loyalists filed a petition to impeach ms duster that trial is due to take place in the senate later this year if she is impeached under the constitution she would be barred from holding high political office killing her long standing presidential ambitions and weakening the political power of the deserter even further president macros now appears to have moved deftly to neutralist his main political rival but his strategy is not risk free the deserter remain popular in much of the country and may be able to mobilize protests against the former president s prosecution tiara duster has issued a statement accusing the government of surrendering her father to foreign powers and of violating Filipino sovereignty an early test of the support enjoyed by both clans will be the mid term elections in may in his comments to journalists after the plane carrying his predecessor had taken off from manila president macros insisted he was meeting the country s commitments to Interpol which had delivered the ICC warrant but he was coy about the fact that it was an ICC warrant he was executing given that many Filipinos will question what the ICC s remit is in a country which has already left its jurisdiction it is not risk free for the ICC either the court is an embattled institution these days with the trump administration threatening to arrest its top officials should they travel to the us and few countries willing to extradite those it has indicted getting former president duster to the Hague might therefore look like a welcome high profile success but there was a warning from china admittedly not a signatory to the ICC and currently at loggerheads with the Philippines not to politicize ICC cases this was a thinly veiled reference to the fact that this case which is supposed to be about accountability for serious international crimes

by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor no matter the technology says Jessica battle who leads the global no deep seabed mining initiative at the WWW deep sea

filed by investors over the company s reporting of proceeds from a partner company in rm Barron says there s absolutely nothing in it those calling for a moratorium on deep sea mining are virtue signaling he says adding that the new trump administration in the us may help his company we have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration says rm Barron the metals company intends to file an application for deep sea mining in the pacific ocean with the international seabed authority is later this year the is is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities dutch company all seas which is working with rm Barron s firm has developed mining machinery for scooping poly metallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface trials of the system in retrieved more than tonnes of nodules the metals company says the metals company s own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of meters from the mining area rather than many kilometers and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometers from the mining area were total nonsense says rm Barron roentgen hailstone a spokesman for all seas says his firm has adjusted the force of water jets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimize sediment disturbance some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean rm hailstone says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometers rather than discarding it at the surface though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact rm Barron acknowledges that his firm s machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules if you re a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you there will be an impact he says though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind Ann danseuse at Ghent university has studied deep sea wildlife she says the sought after poly metallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures which use them as a substrate so even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance pollution and noise removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem rd child also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures mining could interfere with this he suggests and there s another issue the market for metals metals sought by deep sea mining firms is notoriously volatile meaning the business case for deep sea mining may not be as strong as some hope says lea reiterate at the London school of economics when you delve deeper into it and you look at which minerals actually have supply shortages i m not sure that adds up she says"

geopolitical upheaval are rarely deemed good for business yet that appears to have been the impact of Russia s invasion of Ukraine on two of the aggressor s neighbors to its west Finland and Sweden not directly of course rather it was the two Nordic nations response to the invasion that turned fear into hope both countries applied for membership of the western defense alliance NATO in may some three months after the winter invasion less than three years later they re both full members and already reaping the benefits in terms of both national security and economics we re no longer a country that cannot be trusted observes mica chanson chief executive of Swedish defense company baas in reference to the nation s previous historic neutrality he points out that in the year since Sweden joined NATO in march baas has already negotiated framework agreements with the NATO support and procurement agency snap the snap is the body that organists NATO s ordering from defense firms rm chanson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into what s going on inside the alliance we could t access spas before he says pukka siukosaari Finland s ambassador to the UK agrees being part of NATO brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies it enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defense sector and beyond private companies will benefit from pledges by NATO member states to increase defense spending presently only of the organization s member states currently meet a defense spending target of of GDP but ambitions have grown in recent months only to surge in recent weeks and days midst plenty of turbulence within the alliance midst uncertainty about what NATO might look like in future there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA NATO s newest members spending commitments are already ahead of those e tongue sticking out dressed by several existing members last year Finland spent and Sweden of their respective GDP on defense and both aim to raise this to between and in the next three years examples of new NATO initiatives on Europe s northern flank include the establishment of new NATO bases and efforts to establish joint defense forces in northern Finland plus the formation of the joint Nordic air command which brings together Finland s Sweden s Norway s and Denmark s front line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence in addition substantial investments will be required to replenish stockpiles of advanced weapons systems including missiles and anti tank systems rm chanson points out and while the white house this week announced a pause in us military aid to Ukraine European leaders have declared they re in it for the long haul so here too we can e tongue sticking out etc substantial and ongoing spending on arms aerial surveillance programmed and underwater systems are also increasingly in demand as the returning tension between Russia and the west brings a new chill to the arctic region in these areas baas s boss is eager to promote its own solutions such as the global eye airborne early warning and control platform and its sea wasp a remotely controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralist e tongue sticking out plosive devices yet given Donald trump s strong emphasis on America first it is unlikely that he will be happy with European NATO members choosing baas or indeed any other European defense firm over us rivals Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the us with its obvious need to retain American support European members will also need to consider NATO s defense systems complexities and inter dependencies they often combine technologies and machines weaponry and ammunition vehicles crafts and vessels that are produced in several different NATO countries in a sense then the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight Europe s trans Atlantic relationship will always remain important says rm chanson though he also points to a growing realization in Europe that we have to do more on our own the us really protects its own defense industry and we should do the same in Europe he says as he welcomes fierce competition between commercial defense companies much of this competition may be between relative newcomers to the defense industry however Finnish government agency business Finland has published a guidebook that offers advice to companies on how to do business with NATO its authors predict that the armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic will have significant new needs for services and equipment both hi tech and low tech many of these needs will need to be met by start ups and established small to medium sized companies says the guide rather than exclusively by large established defense companies john sj<c3><b6>berg security and defense policy advisor at the confederation of Swedish enterprise says NATO membership has opened doors for Swedish companies not least because the perspective of other countries and companies towards them has changed rm sj<c3><b6>berg adds that he favors a holistic view that security is good for business as increased security and stability

concept also applied by Norway and Denmark it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony energy generation and distribution road networks and secure supplies of food medicine as parts of a total defense system much of this may not be registered as defense spending in the statistics but at the same time none of it is free beyond the civilian infrastructure spending national military service for instance sometimes takes people away from the economically productive parts of the economy ambassador siukosaari points out but perhaps what they deliver does more for the nation than mere provision of products and services NATO s newest members believe they could teach other allied countries a thing or two about defense they clearly offer new perspectives both on how defense spending should be measured and perhaps also on how civilian society and private enterprise can play their parts"

and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is they re armed with industry grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases the devices look a bit like walkies talkies but they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen those numbers can be worrying in a hour period neighborhood researchers found outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower e tongue sticking out plosive limit they have also found methane leaks within homes a key concern has been health methane and other gases notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves are linked to higher risks of asthma milady bah a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organization action in Montgomery reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organization it s very heartbreaking and alarming when you re doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can t change for now ms bah says methane might be a hazard to human health but it is also powerful greenhouse gas while it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide co methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialization methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors chief among these are fossil fuels waste and agriculture but methane is not always easy to notice it can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers it can also be visualized using infrared cameras as methane absorbs infrared light monitoring can be ground based including vehicle mounted devices or aerial including drone based measurement combining technologies is especially helpful there is no perfect solution says dreamland cancan a programmer management officer at the international methane emissions observatory a UN initiative there are trade offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis which could extend to thousands of facilities thankfully she has seen an e tongue sticking out anion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade so there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane at any scale and the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high emitting events she says at a larger scale satellites are often good at pinpointing super emitters less frequent but massively emitting events such as huge oil and gas leaks or they can detect the smaller and more spread out emitters that are much more common such as cattle farms current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter says Riley endure the CEO of the carbon mapper a not for profit organization that tracks emissions he likens this to film cameras a telephoto lens offers higher resolution while a wide angle lens allows a larger field of view with a new satellite carbon mapper is focusing on high resolution high sensitivity and rapid detection to more precisely detect emissions from super emitters in august carbon mapper launched the tanager satellite together with NASA s jet propulsion laboratory and the earth imaging company planet labs satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation low light high latitudes mountains and offshore areas also present challenges rm endure says that the high resolution tanager can respond to some of these challenges for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover in an oil and gas field high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline he says this could help determine exactly who is responsible carbon mapper began releasing emissions data drawing on tanager observations in November it will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites which will depend on funding tanager sin t the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data methane sat a project of the environmental defense fund and private and public partners also launched in with the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies what was previously unsaleable is now visible rm endure says as a society we re still learning about our true methane footprint it s clear that better information is needed about methane emissions some energy companies have sought to evade methane

images verified by humans to train a machine learning model to recognize such plumes in all the locations that mars constantly monitors based on their history of emissions the model checks for a methane plume every day analysts then scrutinize any alerts because there are so many locations to be monitored this saves us a lot of time says tiara karakul loiterer the remote sensing lead for the international methane emissions observatory which is responsible for mars in the two years since its launch mars has sent out over alerts for major methane leaks only of those have led to responses however ms karakul remains optimistic some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator did t officially provide feedback and communications are improving all the time ms karakul says i have hope that this we will see it grow a lot in the next year at the community level it s been powerful for residents such as those in the Washington dc area to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation now that we know better we can do better says Noelle nova of interfaith power and

says international students will always be welcome but the net migration levels seen in recent years have been completely unacceptable and we have committed to reducing those numbers substantially Coventry in the west midlands is particularly dependent on the international student economy in of universities with at least students Coventry university had the second highest percentage of international students in England outside London there were non UK students out of a total of according to the most recent figures from the higher education statistics agency hes jingle yuan spent seven years as a construction project manager in her native china where she oversaw building projects that housed more people than are found in some UK cities the Coventry university alumnus has a masters degree in advanced engineering management and paid to stay in the UK on a graduate visa while looking for work but has been unable to find a job all of my bachelor degrees classmates from home have gone back to china she says my friend got to from our government if she came back and for us if we choose to stay we need to pay to the UK government can you see the difference the one thing stopping more students coming here is recent changes in the visa says mo hammed mullah sashayed from India student visa restrictions took effect in January meaning postgraduates lost the right to bring dependent family members to the UK and new students were prevented from switching to a work visa before the end of their courses there was an drop in the number of sponsored study visas for dependents from in to in mo hammed says another factor is international students pay more than UK ones Coventry university says tuition fees can vary depending on the course but as of September most

insecure place right now conflict climate change and fears of recession dominate the headlines but for some people things are going rather well the wealthy despite the global turmoil the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too so what to do with all that money the growing trend for the ultimate luxury e tongue sticking out experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash for the tourist industry in particular it s an opportunity in Switzerland which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury the number of five star hotels is increasing faster than any other category many of them were built in the early ht century grand belle toque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged primarily English tourists today renovated to the highest standards those hotels leave no guest s wish unmet there are luxury spas gourmet restaurants and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps some offer ski butlers to ferry guests to and from the slopes carry the skis and even help put on their boots key markets are the us the gulf states china and south east Asia American guests in particular swiz hoteliers say e tongue sticking out etc the full five star treatment including hour room service so that they can order food in the middle of the night meanwhile china and India are emerging markets where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend but the five star offer comes with a hefty price tag so where does that leave those who are not billionaires marks Berger of Switzerland tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high end guests but to take a hard headed look at the figures stays at swiz five star hotels make up around of all overnights but the guests in them contribute at least of Switzerland s total revenue from tourism the numbers speak for themselves says rm Berger the high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests what s more he adds Switzerland with its high wage high price economy cannot compete with less e tongue sticking out endive neighbors particularly now that the swiz franc is so strong Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices rm Berger e tongue sticking out liens there is always somewhere cheaper instead the focus is on quality service and added value like those ski butlers in exchange guests who come to five star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy spending lavishly in the Michelin starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of swiz alpine resorts but it s not an entirely win win situation in some of Switzerland s most famous up market resorts like st motorize or matter there are long standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market a common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five star service they sometimes find themselves commuting late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter s salary moniker band who leads the tourism research unit at Bern university s center for regional development sees Switzerland s pitch to high end guests as a fine balancing act it s about quantity versus quality she says more tourists earn t necessarily better she believes instead higher spending by existing numbers can be positive and she adds Switzerland needs to watch out for the tipping point where the destinations really lose their character questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of wen gen world famous for its landlubber ski race and its decades long connection with British skiers the much loved down hill only ski club celebrated its ht anniversary this year and also this year wen gen is opening its first ever five star hotel and there are plans too for a five star complex of serviced hotel apartments they will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the alps and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent by calling the project a hotel it e tongue sticking out toils a loophole in Switzerland s strict laws against the cold beds of holiday homes in theory the law limits them to no more than of a resort s accommodation the swiz heritage society has formally objected to the wen gen plans because claims spokesman Simon Weiss the project is not really a hotel it looks like a typical holiday home complex there is no integration into the community the required public spaces that a hotel would have a restaurant and a spa are planned but they will all be underground the design priority rm Weiss fears is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year the design is unacceptable he adds some wen gen locals also have their doubts it s not st motorize here one told swiz media adding wen gen is not posh wen gen s tourism director role wegm<c3><bc>ller agrees with that assessment but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won t change the resort s character we re not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden he says wen gen he points out is only accessible by train so unlike st motorize there will be no scentless or rolls romances taking up parking spaces even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth rm wegm<c3><bc>ller believes our guests won t want to show off what they have the resort also has visitors who come back year after year contributing to the integration rm Weiss worries about losing some families have been coming for generations says rm wegm<c3><bc>ller the locals know them and that s good among them are brain pollen keen member of the down hill only club who has been coming to wen gen for more than years he loves it but does worry that some of the charm has gone from the place it s over built but most in wen gen like Switzerland tourism see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive these villages were not much more than a century ago very poor a ht English guide to the swiz alps wrote that most of the children are beggars in more recent years the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close tourism winter and summer is enormously important for the swiz economy especially for the mountain communities and as rm Berger of Switzerland tourism points out while the five star sector is growing three star hotels are still the biggest category we have one to five star in wen gen adds rm wegm<c3><bc>ller that s a good thing in a resort

European address Ireland s hospitals often lag far behind in technology they lack shared computerized patient records or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics in July a computer system failure made Dublin s mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its a e three years before Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system s entire computer network and published people s medical records online but Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernist its healthcare that includes a programmer called sl<c3><a1>intecare announced in the plan is to use some of its b b b budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care like the UK s or Canada s to improve healthcare pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved it s a problem being tackled at Dublin s mater hospital years old and the location of Ireland s busiest emergency department that s especially so in winter when one day early this January Irish a e departments had people on trolleys waiting to be seen in Ireland the big problem we have is waiting lists and in particular waiting for diagnostics for MRI magnetic resonance imaging or ct computed tomography scans says prof peter McMahon a consultant radiologist at the mater because of prof McMahon who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer the mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence AI across its radiology department the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment to make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first prof McMahon says we use AI to immediately analyses all head scans for bleeds all chest scans for blood clots and all bone x rays for fractures the AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors when they don t have e tongue sticking out experienced consultants to turn to now a nurse or junior doctor at am sin t alone they be got a wing man he says rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges lettering university hospital in done gal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends currently a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin but now prof McMahon and the mater s AI research fellow Paul banana have trained a trial AI model to create a synthetic MRI from ct scans to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries that was done by feeding a generative AI model around pairs of ct and MRI images of the same area on the same person now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the ct scan something available in all emergency departments and since radiology scans also come with doctors text reports he is also e tongue sticking out lording using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central digital filing system since but a lot of other important information like medical notes or electrocardiograms ergs remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally that will severely delay applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care points out prof McMahon aging it systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge quite bluntly a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy it systems where they re just trying to keep the show on the road says rd Robert Ross a senior computer science lecturer at technological university Dublin doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do he says using AI in healthcare is not without problems an example here is AI speech recognition tools using them could let doctors spend less time on note taking and report writing but some have been found to make things up including to invent non existent medication to prevent such AI from hallucinating you need to make sure it s penalized in its training if it gives you something that does t exist says prof McMahon sis can have biases but humans have biases too he points out a tired doctor e tongue sticking out eating a young patient to be healthy can overlook their blood clot for whatever reason we re far more open to accept human error than in new health technology where the acceptable risk is zero says prof se<c3><a1>n kennel a consultant at taillight university hospital and professor at trinity college Dublin this means we continue with the illusion of accuracy in humans and ignore areas where AI supported technology can make better clinical decisions he says healthcare regulators who already have a weak enough understanding of software as a medical device haven t at all caught up with rules for AI says rd aid an baron founder of an Irish medical tech start up called digital gait labs and a researcher at Dublin city university for example getting a Ce mark which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured but in the case of software that is not relevant says rd baron for us manufacturing literally means copying software he points out AI can have a black box problem we can see what goes in them and what comes out but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them that can create difficulties for a doctor trying to e tongue sticking out lain treatment decisions that involve AI says rd Paul

reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to of GDP by following president trump s demand that all European allies increase their defense contributions the decision comes as sir heir is set to fly to the us for talks with trump in the white house to discuss the war in Ukraine later backbench questioned sir heir over the exact amount which defense secretary john healer said could be calculated as b when inflation was taken into account and whether the chaos deal would be funded from it at prime minister s questions backbench asked whether any of the new funding would be going towards the multi billion pound chaos deal twice the UK plans to hand over the territory to Mauritius but under the terms of the deal the UK will continue to lease one of the islands Diego Garcia which contains a UK us military airbase for a period of years the pm responded saying the increase in defense spending that was announced on Tuesday was for our capability on defense and security in Europe adding the chaos deal is extremely important for our security and for us security backbench focused her questions to the prime minister on which figure for the defense rise his initial b or b which healer said was the increase in real terms was correct sir heir responded if you take the numbers for this financial year and then the numbers for the financial year that s a b increase that s the largest sustained increase in defense spending since the cold war which will put us in a position to ensure the security and defense of our country and of Europe backbench pressed him again saying the ifs said today that the government is playing silly games with numbers how does he find this difference in numbers repeating himself the pm then said they had already been going through the same question over and over again at previous PMs and said if you ask again i ll give the same answer again to loud cheers from his backbenches objecting backbench pointed out that being patronizing is not the same as answering the question when backbench suggested sir heir had listened to her advice on using international aid money for defense he said i m going to have to let the leader of the opposition down gently she did t feature in my thinking at all i was so busy over the weekend i did t even see her proposal she has appointed herself i think savior of the western civilization in a desperate search for relevance liberal democrat leader sir ed cadaver urged the prime minister to back the idea of a European rearmament bank so that we can finance a big increase in manufacturing capacity without the need to cut Britain s vital soft power the prime minister replied that there was an ongoing discussion with allies about future funding and he would share details with mos as it evolves earlier a former defense chief of staff said he believed the decision to hike UK defense spending has been accelerated by president Donald trump s actions on Ukraine general sir David Richards said the decision to raise defense spending over the next two years was a sound strategic move but one that almost certainly would not be happening if not for trump it was going to happen it s now been accelerated by Donald trump s actions and all of us i think would say not before time he told BBC radio s today programmer lord Richards stressed the British army was currently very hollowed out indeed and suggested the army sin t big enough currently for British troops to be part of a rotation of European peacekeeping forces questions have been raised about the labor government s u turn on its manifesto pledge to raise international development funding to of gross national income with unease among some labor mos about the move speaking at PMs labor backbenches Diane Abbott suggested the decision could increase the risk of conflict abroad telling the pm that there is also a view that taking money from aid and development to spend on armaments and tanks makes people less safe not more safe because the desperation and poverty that so often leads to warfare is what aid and development money is supposed to counter the pm defended the decision in the chamber and earlier healer had said hard power is now more important than soft power asked whether the increase announced on Tuesday is linked to sir heir s visit to the white house healer told the today programmer president trump over the last two weeks has been very direct in his challenge he s reinforced the imperative and the importance of Britain making this commitment and helping other European countries to step up in a similar way the us has been warning European leaders it wants to see a significant increase in their defense contributions to NATO for at least a decade trump s rapprochement with Russia s Vladimir Putin and the us siding with Russia on a UN resolution on Ukraine has sent shock waves through European allies asked whether he believed the UK increasing its defense contribution would bring trump on

was one of china s most prominent businessmen had withdrawn from public life after criticizing china s financial sector in his reappearance at Monday s event has sparked a wave of discussion with e tongue sticking out erst and analysts wondering what it means for him china s tech sector and the economy in general the response has been overwhelmingly positive tech stocks including those of alibi rallied soon after the event on Thursday the e commerce giant reported financial results that beat e tongue sticking out expectations with shares ending the trading day in new York more than higher the company s shares are up since the beginning of the year so what are analysts reading into rm ma s appearance at the event alongside other high profile guests including deep seek founder ling fencing analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event jack ma s attendance his seating in the front row even though he did not speak and his handshake with xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated china analyst bill bishop wrote social media was abuzz with users praising rm ma for his return to the public spotlight congratulations jack ma for the safe landing said one user on Chinese social media platform weirdo the comeback of jack ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy said another it is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by rm ma before his disappearance from public life in following comments at a financial conference that china s state owned banks had a pawn shop mentality rm ma was the poster boy for china s tech industry an English teacher with no background in computing rm ma co founded alibi in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace he went on to build one of china s largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country s richest men that was before his pawn shop comment when he also lamented the lack of innovation in the country s banks it led to the cancellation of his b b stock market flotation of ant group his financial technology giant this was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful and a leader who had become too outspoken analysts agree that the fact he s back in the spotlight at a symposium where xi jinking himself presided is a very good sign for rm ma some caution however that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed also the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated xi jinking told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate grow and remain confident despite china s economic challenges which he described as temporary and localized he also said it was the right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents this has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces rm ma s downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on china s tech industry companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules as well as state control over important digital assets other companies across the private sector ranging from education to real estate also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the common prosperity campaign the measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of china s biggest companies to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings but as Beijing imposed tough new regulations billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies many of them tech firms rattling international investors this along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia s invasion of Ukraine has contributed to considerable changes in china s economic situation growth has slowed jobs for the country s youth have become more scarce and amid a property sector downturn people are not spending enough as rumors that rm ma would attend Monday s meeting

firm aweigh electric vehicle e giant bud and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors the guest list showcased the importance of internet tech AI e sectors given their representation of

financial markets investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks particularly those of tech companies listed in Hong gonk and mainland china investment banking giant Goldman sates has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies revenues and attract as much as b of investment but the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of deep seek having to innovate due to a ban on the e tongue sticking out rot of advanced chips and technology to china now with trump back in the white house and his fondness of trade tariffs rm xi may have found it necessary to re calibrate his approach to china s entrepreneurs instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth some analysts believe Monday s meeting signaled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward rm xi s national priorities the Chinese president has been increasingly emphasizing policies that the government has referred to as high quality development and new productive forces such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth such as property and infrastructure investment towards high end industries such as semiconductors clean energy and AI the goal is to achieve socialist modernization by higher living standards for everyone and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology rm xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny jack ma s reappearance suggests that Beijing is

programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug midst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky much to everyone s relief the impact turned out to be minimal today some fear there is a new critical threat to the world s digital infrastructure but this time we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated that s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyper connected world will be trivially easy to crack quantum computing is radically different to the classical computing used today instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states one or zero on or off quantum computing uses quits which can exist in multiple states or superposition the reason why it s so powerful is because you re doing all those possible computations simultaneously prof banishment pastry director of research for computer science at the university of surrey e tongue sticking out liens this means it s much much more efficient much much more powerful this means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers is areas such as medical research and materials science or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems the problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust confidentiality and privacy across today s computer networks today s computers would take thousands even millions of years to crack current encryption standards such as rs a suitably powerful quantum computer could theoretically do the job in minutes this has implications for everything from electronic payments and commerce to satellite communications anything that s protected by something that s vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers says Jon France chief information security officer at non profit cybernetics organization sic quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away but progress is being made in December google said its new quantum chip incorporates key breakthroughs and paves the way to a useful large scale quantum computer some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require quits while others say millions would be needed today s systems have a few hundred at most but businesses and governments face a problem right now as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decry pt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices Greg wet more vice president for software development at security firm entrust says if such devices could emerge in the next decade technology leaders need to ask what data in your organization is valuable for that period of time that could be national security information personal data strategic plans and intellectual property and secrets think of a soft drink company s secret formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe rm France adds if quantum computing becomes widespread the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions for example potentially trivial to break the good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem in august the national institute of standards and technology in the us released three post quantum encryption standards the agency said these would secure a wide range of electronic information from confidential email messages to e commerce transactions that propel the modern economy it is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible and said a further algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards the problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure if you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them it s billions of things we re facing a really big change problem says rm France some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade your browser for example will simply receive an update from the vendor says rm France the challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things it he continues these might be hard to track down and geographically inaccessible some equipment legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems for example might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards rm wet more says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past but it s the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious so it is trying to help customers build crypt agility by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptography assets that s the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one and the challenge extends into space prof pastry says many satellites such as the starling network should be relatively straightforward to upgrade even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily at any given point in time especially with the Leo low earth orbit satellites you be got to satellites above your head prof pastry says so if one can t serve you well so what there are nine others that can serve you more challenging he says are remote sensing satellites which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes these carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module a hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device however says prof pastry this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches while the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of that s because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline says fran<c3><a7>ois suppressor associate professor in

your robot can see through smoke well you re going to need some smoke but a university of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night e tongue sticking out merriment to test such a robot shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine a loud fire alarm went off the whole building got triggered says mining chaos of the university of Pennsylvania smiling my student called me he was very surprised the incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio based sensing system radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke intense rain or even around corners such waves can even detect concealed weapons but simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras light detection and ranging liar and other sensors however prof chaos and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves of course radar which uses radio waves has been used for decades to track aircraft ships and the weather but the spinning array on prof chaos s robot throws radio waves in all directions an on board artificial intelligence AI system then builds a d view of the environment with this information what we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot e tongue sticking out liens prof chaos he suggests the technology could help a future search and rescue robot save people from a burning building subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms although humans can t see them radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum which also includes x rays and gamma rays only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light being light radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials though in a slightly different way to visible light prof chaos and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections the crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles prof chaos says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner think of it like a hall of mirrors he suggests just for radio waves rather than visible light it s really very interesting work and quite impressive says freedman rein hard at the university of restock in Germany who was not involved in the work in prof rein hard and colleagues described how WI phi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms one slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot by definition see in all directions at once prof rein hard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device however the robot sends out radio waves in the millimeter wave band waves that are between one and ten millimeters long this is the same technology used for some g installations that s potentially very attractive it s a very well understood cheap technology says prof rein hard i certainly would love to see a self driving car driving only on radar but it is possible to avoid using spinning radio emitting devices to get a full picture says fa bio DA Silva founder and chief executive of us firm wakens which is also developing radio based sensing technology we created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don t have to spin our antennas he says he describes the system as akin to echolocation used by bats it sends out radio waves and listens to how the waves come back which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives radio waves can even fingerprint the details of a room then if scanned again later this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved last year scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinize other countries management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles it would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around for example separately lunar liveried at lough borough

applications police forces and militarizes have access to radio based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls to some extent war fighting is definitely one market that it caters to it can be used to find and kill someone says rm DA Silva he has exhibited wakens technology to the us department of defense and the Israeli ministry of defense he says and yet these applications are

criminal who was killed by security forces in has achieved a near cult like status around the world immortalized in books music and TV productions like the Netflix series narcs in Colombia itself his name and face are adorned on mugs key chains and t shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors but a proposed law in Colombia s congress is seeking to change this the bill wants to ban escarole merchandise and that of other convicted criminals to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least killings difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a t shirt or a sticker sold on a street corner says Juan sebasti<c3><a1>n g<c3><b3>mez congress member and co author of the bill the proposed law would prohibit the selling as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals including escarole it would mean fines for those who violated the rules and a temporary suspension of businesses many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods this is terrible we have a right to work and these Pablo t shirts especially always sell well says journal Montoya who owns a stall stocked full of escarole merchandise in communal a popular tourist zone of medell<c3><ad>n medell<c3><ad>n escarole s hometown was known as the most dangerous city in the world in the late s and early s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia s armed conflict today it s been revitalized into a hub of innovation and tourism with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs some related to escarole this escarole merchandise benefits many families here it sustains us it helps us pay our rent buy food look after our kids says ms montage who supports herself and her young daughter ms Montoya says at least of her sales come from escarole products but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it s as much as if the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarize themselves with the new rules and phase out their escarole stock we d need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones e tongue sticking out liens congressman g<c3><b3>mez he says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords and that the association with escarole has stigmatized the country abroad some of the t shirts sold for around bear a catchphrase linked to

that the profit gained from sales of escarole merchandise sin t ethical we need this ban he did awful things and these souvenirs are things that should t exist she says e tongue sticking out nailing that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks escarole items escarole and his medell<c3><ad>n cartel at one point were believed to have controlled of the cocaine entering the us in he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine he spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighborhoods but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population years on from his father s death rm Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man who loved his family for him the bill is a defining moment it s a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialization of images of Pablo escarole in order to correct it says rm Rojas yet he does have criticisms about the proposals he believes the bill does t focus enough on education rm Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green t shirt with a silhouette of escarole and the words Pablo president it caused me such confusion that i awns t able to say anything to him about it he says there needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations so that there sin t a positive image of what a cartel boss is rm Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around escarole and the drug trade along with some other victims he launched narcoses co in an online shop that appears to sell escarole themed items but none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim rm Rojas says the site has attracted million visits from around the world in Colombia s congress the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law g<c3><b3>mez says he s hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of congress in Germany you don t sell lither t shirts or swastikas in Italy you don t sell Mussolini stickers and you don t go to Chile and get a copy of Pinochet s id card i think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country a conversation that has t happened yet medell<c3><ad>n s mayor who was also a presidential candidate in the elections has

Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic when GDP shrank by in one year we are getting out of oviduct without scars and by modernizing our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth he adds that modernization process is being aided by post pandemic recovery funds from the EU s next generation programmer Spain is due to receive up to b by b b making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy Spain is investing the money in the national rail system low emissions zones in towns and cities as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small

business school other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry which she says is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy competition from china and other Asian countries the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism since oviduct the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost of living crisis triggered by supply chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in inflation peaked at an annual rate of in July of that year with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard but by the end of it had fallen back to Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public

helped counter Spain s traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine he said and i think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms the country s green energy output is seen as another favorable factor not just in guaranteeing electricity but also spurring investment Spain has the second largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU the latter is a boon for a country that is Europe s second biggest car

the us and Israel are not members of the ICC in November the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Israeli prime minister Benjamin planetary judges at the court said there were reasonable grounds that planetary and his former defense minister yo av gallant and hams military commander mo hammed def bore criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity Israel denies the

of powerful people around the world preparing to make their way to pairs and a sense that many of them are holding their breath on Monday against the sumptuous backdrop of the city s year old grand Calais representatives from countries including world leaders tech bosses academics and other e tongue sticking out erst will gather for a two day global summit to discuss current progress and future goals for the rapidly evolving hugely disruptive technology that is artificial intelligence that might be what s on the official agenda of the artificial intelligence action summit but there is something else that s breathing fire into this particular talking shop deep seek a horse racing fan once told me that the night before a big race everyone s a winner and with china dramatically blowing the AI competition in a new direction with deep seek its super efficient and super viral AI assistant suddenly there s a feeling ahead of the summit that the pole position occupied by the us AI sector despite its vast wealth and AI infrastructure might not be quite so out of reach after all prof Gina eff from the reminder center for technology and democracy at the university of Cambridge says there is currently a vacuum for global leadership on AI prof dame Wendy hall from Southampton university agrees deep seek made everybody realist that china is a force to be reckoned with says the computer scientist we don t have to just go along with what the big companies on the west coast are saying we need global dialogue on that front the timing of the summit could not be better Europe also spies an opportunity to make a new bid for the AI crown one of french president Emmanuel macron s officials described the summit to journalists as a wake up call for France and Europe adding that the bloc must not let the AI revolution pass it by other countries also recognize a potential shifting of AI power in the air India pm arena midi has confirmed his attendance at this summit having not come to previous gatherings the us is sending some serious firepower as a defensive signal of its own including vice president JD Vance opening chief executive SAM Altman and google s sundae archaic eon musk is notably absent from the official guest list but he will undoubtedly have something to say about it all whether he s there in person or not British prime minister skier smarter is also reportedly staying away there have been two previous summits the first held in the UK and the second in south chorea a lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time on the steps of the historic mansion of bletch house in November and promised to try to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks for one thing half of the global population has been to the polls since then in bletch park china s vice minister for science and technology woo zhaohui attended but there were whispers that he was kept at arms length on the grounds of national security in pairs by comparison i e tongue sticking out etc china to be guests of honor the country is reportedly sending one of its most senior leaders ding anorexia a close ally of president xi jinking there s also a buzz around whether deep seek creator ling fencing will join him i asked chatting to list some of AI s notable milestones since the south chorea summit of may deep seek did not make the cut of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both deep seek and chatting tools that create content like text images video it may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers but there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms model climate change solutions develop new formulas for drugs and that will all be in scope in pairs furthermore the David v Goliath narrative around which the story of deep seek hangs does merit further scrutiny the boss of AI firm misanthropic radio demode has written a compelling blog about whether deep seek really was built at a fraction of the cost of its us rivals we do know that it was built on their shoulders using a number of NVIDIA chips probably older ones because of us sanctions and some open source AI architecture developed by meta in addition opening has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this given that opening products will happily produce output in the style of individual human creators but nonetheless deep seek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted and it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process it will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms there s one more theme running through the AI summit that will be worth keeping an eye on the first summit had the word safety in its title some felt the event pushed the narrative too hard and terrified people with dark talk of existential threats but it has t fallen of the agenda entirely as a subject AI safety is a rather broad church it can relate to any number of risks the generation and spread of misinformation displays of bias and discrimination against individuals or races the ongoing development by multiple countries of AI controlled weapons the potential for AI to create unstoppable computer viruses prof Geoffrey Hinton often described as one of the godfathers of AI says these as short term risks they might be up for discussion in pairs but he argued on BBC radio s today programmer last week that they are unlikely to garner strong international collaboration in the long term the big scenario which he believes will really pull everyone together is the prospect of AI becoming more intelligent than humans and wanting to seize control nobody wants AI to take over from people he says the Chinese would much rather the Chinese communist party ran the show than AI prof Hinton compared this eventuality to the height of the cold war when the us and Russia just about succeeded in collaborating in order to prevent global nuclear war there s no hope of stopping AI development he said what we be got to do is to try to develop it safely prof max marketer founder of the future of life institute also shares a stark warning either we develop an amazing AI tool that helps humans or uncontrollable ago artificial general intelligence that replaces humans he says we are unfortunately closer to building ago than to figuring out how to control it prof marketer hopes the summit will push for binding

Egypt countries that trump wants to take in Gaza s Palestinians and Saudi Arabia which might be e tongue sticking out acted to foot the bill western allies of the us and Israel are also against the idea some perhaps many Palestinians in Gaza might be tempted to get out if they had the chance but even if a million left as many as m others would still be there presumably the united states the new owners of trump s riviera of the middle east would have to use force to remove them after America s catastrophic intervention in Iraq in that would be deeply unpopular in the us it would be the final end of any lingering hope that a two state solution was possible that is the aspiration that a conflict more than a century old could be ended with the establishment of an independent Palestine alongside Israel the planetary government is adamantly against the idea and over years of failed peace talks two states for two peoples became an empty slogan but it has been a central plank of us foreign policy since the early s the trump plan would also violate international law America s already threadbare assertions that it believes in a rules based international order would dissolve Russia s territorial ambitions in Ukraine and china s in Taiwan would be turbocharged why worry about all that if it is not about to happen at least not in the way trump announced in Washington watched by a grinning and clearly delighted Benjamin planetary the answer is that trump s remarks however outlandish will have consequences he is the president of the united states the most powerful man in the world no longer a reality TV host and political hopeful trying to grab headlines short term the disruption caused by his stunning announcement could weaken the fragile ceasefire in Gaza one senior Arab source told me it could be its death knell the absence of a plan for Gaza s future governance is already a fault line in the agreement now trump has provided one and even if it does not come to pass it presses very big buttons in the minds of Palestinians and Israelis it will nourish the plans and dreams of ultra nationalist Jewish extremists who believe all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river and perhaps beyond is a god given Jewish possession their leaders are part of planetary s government and keep him in power and they re delighted they want the Gaza war to resume with the longer term objective of removing the Palestinians and replacing them with Jews the finance minister bezel ostrich said trump had provided the answer to Gaza s future after the October attacks his statement said that whoever committed the most terrible massacre on our land will find himself losing his land forever now we will act to finally bury with god s help the dangerous idea of a Palestinian state centrist opposition leaders in Israel have been less effusive perhaps fearing trouble ahead but have offered a polite welcome to the plan hams and other Palestinian armed groups may feel the need to answer trump with some kind of show of force against Israel for Palestinians the conflict with Israel is driven by dispossession and the memory of what they call AL naked the catastrophe that was the exodus of Palestinians as Israel won its war for independence in more than Palestinians either fled or were forced from their homes by Israeli forces all but a handful were never allowed back and Israel passed laws it still uses to confiscate their property now the fear will be that it is happening again many Palestinians already believed Israel was using the war against hams to destroy Gaza and e tongue sticking out e the population it is part of their accusation that Israel is committing genocide and now they might believe Donald trump is adding his weight to Israel s plans just because trump says something that does not make it true or certain his statements are often more like opening gambits in a real estate negotiation than e tongue sticking out sessions of the settled policy of the united states perhaps trump is spreading some confusion while he works on another plan he is said to crave the noble peace prize middle east peacemakers even when they do not ultimately succeed have a strong track record of winning it as the world was digesting his Gaza announcement he posted on his truth social platform his desire for a verified nuclear peace agreement with Iran the Iranian regime denies it wants nuclear weapons but there has been an open debate in Tehran about whether they are now so threatened that they need the ultimate deterrent for many years planetary has wanted the us with Israeli help to destroy Iran s nuclear sites doing a deal with Iran was never part of his plan during trump s first term planetary waged a long and successful campaign to persuade him to pull the us out of the nuclear deal Barack Obama s administration signed with Iran if trump wanted to throw the Israeli hard right something to keep them happy

local bank it will cost you interest to get a loan she complains as a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest we be had to rely on what we can get soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies she says that this situation is why less than of Ghana s cashews are processed locally the bulk are scooped up and e tongue sticking out sorted to big factories in countries like India Thailand and Vietnam remarkably some of those packaged nuts are then e tongue sticking out sorted back to Ghana where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews this is despite the mile sea freight round trip and import costs it is a similar picture for rice which is e tongue sticking out sorted to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices despite Ghana also growing the crop itself back in the Ghanaian government e tongue sticking out experimented with an e tongue sticking out rot ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing however the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders without available cheap loans it awns t possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market so the price of raw nuts crashed and many started rotting for want of a buyer more recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew e tongue sticking out rots and bans on e tongue sticking out otters purchasing cashews directly from farms but all these policy interventions miss a key point according to rm simony a big challenge for local producers he says is to work harder on the basics of doing business and growing their companies in order to be efficient at this you need scale he says adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country you need a lot of a shanghais consuming the nuts not just a small middle class prof radon guacamole a Turkish American economist agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana s cashew industry he was one of last year s winners of the noble memorial prize in economic sciences for his work on the struggles facing low income economies and in particular their home grown businesses yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews these firms are dealing with workforce that earn t properly skilled they have infrastructures that earn t working they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials or rule changes and also it s very difficult to reach foreign markets he says they need the foreign market because the domestic market is small and their own government has very little capacity to boost it he also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation but rm simony reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews as it is he says many of the country s most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive there s a massive brain drain he says my theory of why Africa s economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side but the real beauty is in demand creating a consuming class of cashew eating enthusiasts and you don t have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation he says the same argument applies to Ghana s other bigger e tongue sticking out rots like gold and chocolate neither of which gets much value addition within Ghana before getting e tongue sticking out sorted to the west Mildred amniotic hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend she now wants to build her own logistics arm to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate i have a lot of calls from the use from Canada and America currently we can t meet demand we can t get enough kernels to roast there s a ready market both locally and internationally my branding is good my marketing is good my dream is to give a face lift to Ghanaian processed foods"

received an interesting gift from a friend my very own best selling book tech spraining for dummies great title bears my name and my photo on its cover and it has glowing reviews yet it was entirely written by AI with a few simple prompts about me supplied by my friend Janet it s an interesting read and very funny in parts but it also meanders quite a lot and is somewhere between a self help book and a stream of anecdotes it mimics my chatty style of writing but it s also a bit repetitive and very verbose it may have gone beyond Janet s prompts in collating data about me several sentences begin as a leading technology journalist cringe which could have been scraped from an online bio there s also a mysterious repeated hallucination in the form of my cat i have no pets and there s a metaphor on almost every page some more random than others there are dozens of companies online offering AI book writing services my book was from bookbindery when i contacted the chief executive arid mariachi based in Israel he told me he had sold around personalized books mainly in the us since pivoting from compiling AI generated travel guides in June a paperback copy of your own page long best seller costs the firm uses its own AI tools to generate them based on an open source large language model i m not asking you to buy my book actually you can t only Janet who created it can order any further copies there is currently no barrier to anyone creating one in anybody s name including celebrities although rm mariachi says there are guardrails around abusive content each book contains a printed disclaimer stating that it is fictional created by AI and designed solely to bring humor and joy legally the copyright belongs to the firm but rm mariachi stresses that the product is intended as a personalized gag gift and the books do not get sold further he hopes to broaden his range generating different genres such as sci phi and perhaps offering an autobiography service it s designed to be a light heated form of consumer AI selling AI generated goods to human customers it s also a bit terrifying if like me you write for a living not least because it probably took less than a minute to generate and it does certainly in some parts sound just like me musicians authors artists and actors worldwide have e tongue sticking out dressed alarm about their work being used to train generative AI tools that then churn out similar content based upon it we should be clear when we are talking about data here we actually mean human creators life works says ed newton Rex founder of fairly trained which campaigns for AI firms to respect creators rights this is books this is articles this is photos it s works of art it s records the whole point of AI training is to learn how to do something and then do more like that in a song featuring AI generated voices of Canadian singers drake and the weekend went viral on social media before being pulled from streaming platforms because it was not their work and they had not consented to it it did t stop the track s creator trying to nominate it for a Grammy award and even though the artists were fake it was still wildly popular i do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned but i do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people s work without permission should be banned rm newton Rex adds AI can be very powerful but let s build it ethically and fairly in the UK some organizations including the BBC have chosen to block AI developers from trawling their online content for training purposes others have decided to collaborate the financial times has partnered with chatting creator opening for example the UK government is considering an overhaul of the law that would allow AI developers to use creators content on the internet to help develop their models unless the rights holders opt out ed newton Rex describes this as insanity he points out that AI can make advances in areas like defense healthcare and logistics without trawling the work of authors journalists and artists all of these things work without going and changing copyright law and ruining the livelihoods of the country s creatives he argues baroness nonskid a cross bench peer in the house of lords is also strongly against removing copyright law for AI creative industries are wealth creators million jobs and a whole lot of joy says the baroness who is also an advisor to the institute for ethics in AI at oxford university the government is undermining one of its best performing industries on the vague promise of growth a government spokesperson said no move will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives increased control for right holders to help them license their content access to high quality material to train leading AI models in the UK and more transparency for right holders from AI developers under the UK government s new AI plan a national data library containing public data from a wide range of sources will also be made available to AI researchers in the us the future of federal rules to control AI is now up in the air following president trump s return to the presidency in Biden signed an executive order that aimed to boost the safety of AI with among other things firms in the sector required to share details of the workings of their systems with the us government before they are released but this has now been repealed by trump it remains to be seen what trump will do instead but he is said to want the AI sector to face less regulation this comes as a number of lawsuits against AI firms and particularly against opening continue in the us they have been taken out by everyone from the new York times to authors music labels and even a comedian they claim that the AI firms broke the law when they took their content from the internet without their consent and used it to train their systems the AI companies argue that their actions fall under fair use and are therefore exempt there are a number of factors which can constitute fair use it s not a straight forward definition but the AI sector is under increasing scrutiny over how it gathers training data and whether it should be paying for it if this awns t all enough to ponder Chinese AI firm deep seek has shaken the sector over the past week it became the most downloaded free app on apple s us app store deep seek claims that it developed its technology for a fraction of the price of the likes of opening its success has raised security concerns in the us and threatens American s current dominance of the sector as for me and a career as an author i think that at the moment if i really want a bestseller i ll still have to write it myself if anything tech spraining for dummies highlights the current weakness in generative AI tools for bigger projects it is full of inaccuracies and hallucinations and it

says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades you be got a next generation who haven t engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer

while c is still taught in universities it is no longer widely used in the commercial world rm deadpanning e tongue sticking out liens the fact that c is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation there are ways to work around this rm deadpanning says both wire shark and a project he founded falcon rely on plug ins which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages rm Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of rust as a programming language for Linux while noting the rust versus c discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas when it comes to steering projects into the future leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations the cloud native computing foundation for example oversees projects with more than contributors wire shark has its own independent foundation with rm deadpanning as a board member not everyone subscribes to the foundation model steering and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent i m much better off without being in their neighborhoods and just running my own neighborhood he says and foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive he notes miss Brock says it s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate this is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it s also career enhancing giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills it s a way to help stem talent flight miss Brock adds because people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they re in deadpanning is more sanguine even if there s probably less visceral enthusiasm for the concept of open source he says the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given and he continues i be worked with open source my whole life i be created my own projects i be seen people join the projects that i created i be seen people start their own open source projects ultimately he says there is a joy especially for a young person in creating software seeing it being used and sparking a community that feeling does t get old he says even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do"

decades adds rm isolation and that is a very unique position yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island Greenland is a self governing territory that is part of Denmark but controls its own natural resources it s endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so called rare earth elements which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors it also has large amounts of other key metals such as lithium and cobalt there is oil and gas too but new drilling is banned while deep sea mining has also been ruled out christian fieldsmen director of Greenland s business association says that the global geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world s biggest island he points to china having the world s largest reserves of rare earth metals while the west wants to secure alternative supplies you have a very strong china sitting very heavily on the critical raw materials he says that has fueled a growing focus among western nations to get access to Greenland s minerals china has also been keen to get involved but its presence is limited Reuters recently reported that the us lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland s biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers Greenland s minister for business trade and raw materials naan euthanasia says that interest in the territory

blocs across Greenland where companies are searching for viable deposits British Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign license holders while Americans hold just one but there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches any gold rush continues to be slow to materialist the economy which has an annual GDP of just over b b is still driven by the public sector and fishing and the territory also relies on an annual m subsidy from Denmark Greenland s politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual m subsidy from Denmark and help boost independence efforts but in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism officially mining is still important for independence says Javier aquanaut head of arctic social sciences at Greenland university but in practical terms you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded ms euthanasia concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the us and EU we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector she hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the

merriment began the box like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty megalith a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil soon that megalith was glop a layer of it heated to temperatures above c and with the addition of some reactants oxygen containing molecules began to bubble out we be tested everything we can on earth now says Brant white a program manager at sierra space a private company the next step is going to the moon sierra space s e tongue sticking out merriment unfolded at NASA s Johnson space center in the summer of it is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield including mars lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty Grey debris that litters the lunar surface much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not it could save billions of dollars from mission costs says rm white as he e tongue sticking out liens that the alternative bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from earth would be arduous and e tongue sticking out endive luckily the lunar megalith is full of metal oxides but while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides for example is well understood on earth doing this on the moon is much harder not least because of the conditions the huge spherical chamber that hosted sierra space s tests in July and august this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures the company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged abrasive texture of the megalith itself it gets everywhere wears out all sorts of mechanisms says rm white and the one crucial thing that you can t test on earth or even in orbit around our planet is lunar gravity which is roughly one sixth that of the earth it might not be until or later that sierra space can test its system on the moon using real megalith in low gravity conditions the moon s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen extracting technologies unless engineers design for it says Paul Burke at johns Hopkins university in April he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen extracting process might be hindered by the moon s relatively feeble gravitational pull the process under investigation here was molten megalith electrolysis which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen in order to extract the oxygen directly the problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten megalith itself it is the consistency of say honey it is very very viscous says rd Burke those bubbles earn t going to rise as fast and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes there could be ways around this one could be to vibrate the oxygen making machine device which might jiggle the bubbles free and extra smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach rd Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this sierra space s technology a geothermal process is different in their case when oxygen containing bubbles form in the megalith they do so freely rather than on the surface of an electrode it means there is less chance of them getting stuck says rm white stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar e tongue sticking out editions rd Burke estimates that per day an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of megalith depending on that astronaut s fitness and activity levels however a lunar base s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts if so it would t be necessary to process quite as much megalith just to keep the lunar residents alive the real use case for oxygen extracting technologies adds rd Burke is in providing the oxidizer for rocket fuels which could enable ambitious space e tongue sticking out oration obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better sierra space s system does require the addition of some carbon though the firm says it can recycle most of this after each oxygen producing cycle along with colleagues palatal petal a pd student at the Massachusetts institute of technology came up with an e tongue sticking out experimental molten megalith electrolysis system for extracting oxygen and metal from the lunar soil we re really looking at it from the standpoint of let s try to minimize the number of resupply missions she says when designing their system ms petal and her colleagues addressed the problem described by rd Burke that low gravity could impede the detachment of oxygen bubbles that form on electrodes to counter this they used a fornicator which blasts the bubbles with sound waves in order to dislodge them ms petal says that future resource extracting machines on the moon could derive iron titanium or lithium from megalith for example these materials might help lunar dwelling astronauts make d printed spare parts for their moon base or replacement components for damaged spacecraft the usefulness of lunar megalith does not stop there ms petal notes that in

s largest geothermal power station a large warehouse houses a hi tech indoor farm of sorts that s like nothing i be ever seen under a strange pink purple glow illuminated panels buzz and cylindrical columns of water bubble away as a futuristic crop of micro algae grows it s here that Iceland s taxa technologies has developed a system that harnesses energy and other resources from the nearby power plant to cultivate these tiny aquatic organisms it s a new way of thinking about food production says general manager pristine validations as he gives me a tour of the space age facility for much of

and Africa now scientists and entrepreneurs are increasingly e tongue sticking out lording its potential as a nutrition rich sustainable food about minutes from the capital Reykjavik the taxa site produces the micro algae chloroplasts both as food for people and for feed in fish and shrimp farming it also grows a type of bacteria called arthroscopic also known as blue green algae as it shares similar properties with micro algae when dried out it is known as spiritual and is used as a dietary supplement a food ingredient and as a bright blue food coloring these tiny organisms photosynthesis capturing energy from light to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen the algae is eating co or turning the co into biomass e tongue sticking out liens rm validations it s carbon negative taxa s plant has a unique situation it s the only place where algae cultivation is integrated with a geothermal power station which supplies clean electricity delivers cold water for cultivation hot water for heating and even pipes across its co emissions you end up with a slightly negative carbon footprint says sager munch midst Jensen a food technology consultant at danish technology institute ti who co authored a study assessing the environmental impact of taxa s spiritual production we also found a relatively low footprint both in terms of land and water use round the clock renewable energy plus a stream of co and nutrients with a low carbon footprint are needed to ensure the setup is climate friendly and he thinks that sin t easily replicated there is a huge input of energy to run these photo bioreactors and you have to artificially simulate the sun so you need a high energy light source he e tongue sticking out liens my main takeaway is that we should utilize these areas like Iceland where we have low impact energy sources to make energy intensive products adds rm munch midst Jensen back at the algae plant i climb onto an elevated platform where i m surrounded by noisy

shipping container sized modules that house photo bioreactors and which could link up to carbon emitting industries to capture their co while simultaneously producing food and feed crops are also being used in cosmetics pharmaceuticals bio fuel and a replacement for plastic perhaps also micro algae could be produced in space in a project funded by the European space agency the danish technological institution plans to test if a micro algae can be grown on the international space station despite all the investment there s some way to go before micro algae becomes an everyday part of our diet it still needs a lot of development according to rm munch midst Jensen he points out that the texture lacks firmness meanwhile the taste can be fishy if the algae is a saltwater variety but there are ways of overcoming this he adds there s also the societal question are people ready for it how do we make it so that everyone wants to eat this maleness lime Olsen a food scientist at Copenhagen university who researches micro algae says its nutritional value needs more research green micro algae chancellor have a very robust cell wall so it can be difficult for us to digest and get all the nutrients she says for now she says micro algae is better added to other carrier products like pasta or bread to help with taste texture and appearance however ms Olsen believes micro algae are a promising future food if you compare one hectare of soy in Brazil and imagine we had one hectare of algae field you could produce times more protein a year from the algae back at the plant i m looking at an unappetizing green sludge it s the harvested micro algae with the water squeezed out ready for further processing rm validations offers me a taste and after initial reluctance i try some and find its flavor neutral with a texture like tofu we are absolutely not proposing that anyone should eat green sludge jokes rm validations instead the processed algae is an ingredient for everyday foods and in Reykjavik one bakery makes bread with spiritual and a gym puts it in smoothies we re not going to change what you eat we re just going to change the nutritional value of the

that they have even assisted popular video game football manager in updating its own database in the regions the pair operate in about of the players don t know they are even eligible says guru there s not one way to go about it it depends on what the federation wants and how they want to operate for example with Samoa because a big part of our focus was on youth players we could go public and do a lot of work in communities if you re after a professional player you probably want things to be a bit more discreet we can do both we re speaking with bigger nations at the moment elite football is

workers from overseas called h a this allows us farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas the foreign workers can stay for up to months before they then have to go back to their home countries for people like Sandra it s a chance to get on in life and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns in Guatemala there are now around

first she needs to pay off the rest of the debt that she got herself in to after being scammed when she and her sister first tried to get a visa for the united states we paid someone per person because we wanted to get work in the us she says my sister and i thought we needed to do this so we could move forward and make our dreams come true so we got a loan to get the money but sadly it was

of whom are working in the us without any visas this is a poor region where work is hard to find and families often pay someone called a coyote between and to take them to the us illegally says Olga a big problem is that to raise that amount of money many families need to take out loans secured against the value of their home they can then lose their properties if the money sin t paid back and that is often the case given that the chance of them making it to the us is far from guaranteed with the risk of accidents along the way or being turned back at the us border but the rewards are high the

symptoms he awns t e tongue sticking out eating a diagnosis of osteoporosis the disease strongly associated with age causes bones to become weak and fragile increasing the risk of fracture it turned out that rm studiedly had a severe case of food poisoning but early in his ailment s investigation he received an abdominal ct scan that scan was then later run through artificial intelligence AI technology which identified a collapsed vertebra in rm studiedly s spine a common early indicator of osteoporosis further testing ensued and rm studiedly emerged not only with his diagnosis but a simple treatment an annual infusion of an osteoporosis drug that is e tongue sticking out acted to improve his bone density i feel very lucky says rm studiedly i don t think this would have been picked up without the AI technology it sin t unheard of that a radiologist might note something incidental in a patient s imaging an undetected tumor a concern with a particular tissue or organ outside of what they had originally been checking for but applying AI in the background to systematically comb through scans and automatically identify early signs of common preventable chronic diseases that might be brewing regardless of the reason the scan was originally ordered is new the clinical use of AI for opportunistic screening or opportunistic imaging as it is called is just beginning notes Perry hardtack a professor of radiology and medical physics at the university of Wisconsin Madison who is among those developing the algorithms it is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose be it suspected cancer chest infection appendicitis or belly pain it has the potential to catch previously diagnosed diseases in the early stages before onset of symptoms when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing we can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously says prof hardtack regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases he adds there s a lot of data in ct scans related to body tissues and organs that we don t really use notes Miriam umbrella a radiologist at nu language who is also developing algorithms in the field and while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements it would be time consuming there are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias she notes a disease like osteoporosis for example is thought of as mostly affecting thin elderly white women so doctors don t always think to look outside of that population opportunistic imaging on the other hand does t discriminate that way rm studiedly s case is a good example being relatively young for osteoporosis male and with no history of broken bones it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI in addition to osteoporosis AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease fatty liver disease age related muscle loss and diabetes while the main focus is on ct scans for example of the abdomen or chest work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too including chest x rays and mammograms the algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people stress the e tongue sticking out erst and there is supposed to be a level of human review if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors the AI technology used to examine rm studiedly s scan belongs to Israeli company nanobot AI which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for nanobot AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine ct scans oxford nos hospitals began trialing nanobot AI s osteoporosis focused product in before officially rolling it out in results from oxford hospitals show an up to six fold increase above the nos average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis and start treatment to combat the disease says passim java id a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the university of oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm s introduction further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge Cardiff Nottingham Southampton and Bradford we want to build the evidence to use it across the nos says prof java id yet while the technology can benefit individuals there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says sentient nurselings a professor of healthcare engineering at kings college London who heads the AI center for value based healthcare a big problem that needs to be balanced he notes is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create this is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it he says first people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing which takes resources and if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed the extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits prof java id but there are solutions patients confirmed to have the fractures in oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors the AI does force you to change your pathway he says and in the long run believes prof java id to have a greater number of people with early stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the nos money fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital he says rm studiedly has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand it led to his mother breaking both her hips it used to just be considered an old person s condition with nothing that could be done he says i feel quite privileged i can do something before my bones turn into

countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies Danes are actually happy at work he tells the BBC almost of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent rm wiling who is also the boss of danish think tank the happiness research institute shares several policies that help generate a strong work life balance in Denmark these include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid annual leave per year in addition to public holidays in the UK most workers are entitled to weeks of paid leave but in the us it can be as low as just days Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave in the UK the father or non birthing partner typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave in the us there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave although some states such as California now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child and federal employees can get weeks of paid leave rm wiling is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing he uses the example of staff at the volition gardens amusement park in Copenhagen where they follow the three meter rule the idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three meters if you see garbage within your three meter radius you pick it up and if you see a guest looking for something you stop and ask them if you can help says rm wiling he adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace Janine latchkey a professor in the department of management society and communication at the Copenhagen business school says Denmark is definitely not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day all evening to show that you re working hard all the time instead she says flexibility during the workday gives

churchman as much as other countries can learn from Denmark s work life balance he says it has some downsides some people can rely too much on that safety net and it might say to them that they don t

the mismanagement of the situation when batting with the tail was extremely costly even before the free hit misjudgment twice she turned down singles from the fifth ball of an over and then could not keep the strike from the sixth Gardner s ht over was blocked out by bell and as a result the run rate spiraled way above a run a ball and Jones was backed into a corner to play her shots with more

cricket and put pressure back on the opposition England faced balls out of their available and of them were dot balls when considering moments where the game was lost that is a pretty damning

alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job meaning she can focus more on patients rd mimosa sharp started using Heidi health a free AI assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments about four months ago and says it has made a big difference usually when i m with a patient i am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation she says this now means i can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening it makes for a more quality consultation she says the tech reduces her workflow saving her two to three

technologies such as AI equating to million hours of GP time meanwhile research by oxford university in found that of all administrative work in general practice can now be either mostly or completely automated freeing up time to spend with patients one company working on that is Denmark s corgi which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations either over the phone or in person and suggest follow up questions prompts treatment options as well as automating note taking corgi says its technology processes about patient interactions per day across hospitals GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the us totaling about million encounters per year the idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient says larch maal<c3><b8>e co founder and chief

it might think well in similar conversations most questions asked x and that has not been asked says rm maal<c3><b8>e i imagine GPS have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues it s giving that colleague advice he also says it can look at the historical data of a patient it could ask for example did you remember to ask if the patient is still

practice to inform the patient though if the patient contests it the doctor cannot record we see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation rd misread sharp says she lets

bra baksheesh who is also a GP the AI is trained on published medical research papers for example it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways says rd baksheesh it won t diagnose but it can facilitate she says they have conducted more than cancer risk assessments in a real world setting

Sherman, business reporter, & Liv McMahon","BBC News","the supreme court appears poised to uphold a law that bans ticktock in the us over national security concerns unless its china based parent company sells the platform ahead of a January deadline the court s nine justices heard from lawyers representing ticktock and content creators that the ban would be a violation of free speech protections for the platform s more than million users in the us the us government argued that without a sale ticktock could be used by china as a tool for spying and political manipulation a decision by the top court has to be made within days president elect Donald trump who returns to the white house in just over a week now argues against the ban the law requires ticktock s parent company byte dance to sell it in the us or cease operations on January the company has said it will not sell the short form video platform congress passed the law with support from both the democratic and republican parties a moment that marked the culmination of years of concern about the widely popular platform which is known for its viral videos and traction among young people the legislation does not forbid use of the app but would require tech giants such as apple and google to stop offering it and inhibit updates which analysts suggest would kill it over time ticktock has repeatedly denied any potential influence by the Chinese communist party and has said the law violates the first amendment free speech rights of its users noel Francisco a former us solicitor general appearing for the platform stressed the ban on the most popular speech platform for Americans could also open the door to a dangerous form of censorship he argued that the government cannot restrict speech in order to protect us from speech that s precisely what this law does from beginning to end a representative for platform creators argued they should be free to use the publisher of their choice Jeffrey l fisher a Stanford university law professor representing creators who sued over the law told the court on Friday that the country has historically faced ideological campaigns by foreign adversaries but he said that under the first amendment mere ideas do not represent a national security threat justice department lawyer Elizabeth b premolar told the court that byte dance s ties to the Chinese government made it a national security risk she told the court that Beijing could weaponize ticktock at any time to harm the united states during nearly three hours of arguments the nine justices returned time and again to the national security concerns that gave rise to the law in the first place while also probing free speech questions are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is in fact subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government conservative chief justice john Roberts asked ticktock lawyer rm Francisco justice Brett naughty drilled into concerns the us government has raised about the data the app collects on its users and how that data might be used the risks seem like a huge concern for the future of the country he said in December us president elect Donald trump urged the court to delay its decision until he returns to the white house to enable him to seek a political solution to resolve the issues at hand ticktock s lawyer told the court on Friday that as he saw it the platform would go dark on January without intervention ms premolar arguing for the us justice department said nothing permanent had to happen on that day and there was still time for a sale forcing the app to go dark could be just the jolt byte dance needs to seriously consider a sale she said it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what byte dance might consider she said comparing the situation to game of chicken and one in which the us should not blink first after the hearing legal observers predicted that the supreme court s

professor Carl to bias i e tongue sticking out etc that the justices by a majority will side with the government he added Jacob Hubert a lawyer and the president of the liberty justice center which represents based politics an internet content creator said it was still difficult to predict how the court would rule but he says the ban would violate the freedom of speech of millions of Americans a point he believes was effectively made by ticktock s lawyers it s not about china s rights or the communist party s rights he said it is about the rights of Americans who use ticktock to largely speak with other Americans more than a hundred people braved freezing conditions in Washington dc to attend the hearing in person sloe joy sexton one of the ticktock creators named in the suit said that the platform brought many creators financial independence including many mothers a ticktock ban would place these women myself included in true financial jeopardy she told reporters it would destroy both my business and the community that means so much to me Danielle caballeros a student at cu San Diego said had been waiting outside the court since local time i feel like ticktock does t deserve to be banned she told BBC news while admitting to using it probably too much she said she believes the app to be an important news source for her generation ticktock is already banned from government devices in many countries including in the UK it faces more complete bans in some countries including India last December a three judge appeals court decision upheld the law noting china s record of acting through private companies and saying the measure was justified as part of a broader effort to counter a well substantiated national security threat posed by the country"

feature in a six part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments over a video call Alex zhavoronkov holds up a small green diamond shaped pill it has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure the new drug has yet to be approved but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis if it s one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence AI has been integral to its discovery we can t say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved says rd zhavoronkov the co founder and CEO of us based start up silicon medicine but we may be the furthest along the path welcome to the great AI drug race where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists that includes both smaller specialist AI driven biotech companies which have sprung up over the past decade and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves or in partnership with smaller firms among the newer players is alphabet the parent company of google which launched UK based AI drug discovery company isomorphic labs in late its CEO dimes abscissas shared this year s noble prize in chemistry for an AI model that is e tongue sticking out acted to be useful for AI drug design using AI to do drug discovery could make an enormous difference for patients says Chris Meier of the Boston consulting group cg bringing a new drug to market takes on average to years and costs more than b b it s also risky about of drugs that go into clinical trials fail the hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost and result in more success a new era where AI is at the center of the drug discovery process is emerging says Charlotte dean a professor of structural bio informatics at oxford university who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery we are at the beginning of just how good that might be she says it is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists say e tongue sticking out erst the real savings will come if there are fewer failures but it will mean working in partnership with AI a recently published analysis by cg found at least AI discovered molecules have entered clinical trials with many more e tongue sticking out acted that they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone says rd Meier the next and even bigger milestone will be when they start to come out the other end however prof dean notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an AI discovered drug and in all the examples to date there has still been lots of human involvement there are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed e tongue sticking out liens rd Meier the first is in identifying at the molecular level the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it should t while traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab e tongue sticking out experimentally based on what they understand of a disease AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions the second and more common is in designing the drug to correct the target this employs generative AI also the basis of chatting to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work replacing the e tongue sticking out endive manual process of chemists synthesizing many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one silicon medicine founded in and which has received more than m in funding used AI for both steps as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials including to treat if for which the next phase of trials is being planned in addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials and nearly others are showing promise all have been discovered from scratch using generative AI says rd zhavoronkov our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria the novel molecule to treat if was designed by the company s generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called knit which has never been targeted before for treating if but was suggested by another set of the company s AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesized and tested the discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry notes rd zhavoronkov it took months and required synthesis and testing of molecules where usually it would be e tongue sticking out acted to take about four years and at least the synthesis of other of silicon s molecules have even lower numbers he says the lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally say e tongue sticking out erst that cuts across both target identification and molecule design and can potentially introduce biases us based recursion pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data through automated e tongue sticking out experiments it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body it then trains AI tools to understand that data and find rune tongue sticking out acted relationships to help to do that last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company it has had some success a molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumors is now being tested on cancer patients in early stage clinical trials it was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own recursion co founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither recursion nor anyone else has yet shown that these AI discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that over time they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods when that happens says rd Gibson it ll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go"

headlines after Donald trump repeated his desire to buy Greenland trump cited national security interests but for many the territory s vast mineral wealth is the main attraction yet economic development elsewhere in the vast polar region has ground to a halt working conditions in the arctic ocean are extremely challenging at this time of the year for Norwegian fisherman sundress lanes

storms can bring vast waves rm lanes bones mo works two six hour shifts a day during five week tours on a ship called gratin one of the largest factory trawlers fishing in arctic waters north of

and such the way we are during storms when the waves can be fairly big he grins in understatement rm lanes bones mo is a participant in the so called arctic cold rush a play on words with gold rush it began in earnest around when a series of reports identified vast mineral and hydrocarbon reserves across the arctic region reserves that together with large fishing stocks could continue to become more accessible as climate change reduces ice levels this reduction in ice has also increasingly opened up arctic sea routes north of the Canadian mainland and Russia so much so that in the decade from to the total recorded annual distances sailed by ships in the arctic sea more than doubled from million to million miles the hope in the longer term is that cargo ships can travel from Asia to Europe and the east coast of the us through arctic waters above Canada and Russia but the question rm lanes bones mo now asks himself is this did he arrive too late following Russia s invasion of Ukraine in much of the planned economic development of the arctic region ground to a halt as relations between Russia and the west deteriorated Russia had great plans in the arctic says marten lavender Larsen arctic operation and technology director from Norwegian firm div his company sets rules and standards for the maritime sector they began constructing regional rescue centers complete with ships and helicopters to facilitate both destination shipping for gas oil and coal projects in Siberia as well as for shipping along the northeast passage north of Russia but since the invasion

mining in arctic waters between Norway s Svalbard and Jan maven islands commentators say that while poor relations with Russia is a key reason why Norway is wary of sloughing money into arctic projects its interest in the polar region had already cooled Helene tote director of international cooperation and climate at the Norwegian shipowners association says that in hindsight the outlook for shipping in the arctic had been exaggerated she points out that despite the impact of climate change the arctic remains a difficult place in which to operate conditions in the arctic can be extremely challenging even when the absence of sea ice allows passage she says large parts of the route are far from emergency response capacities such as search and rescue and environmental clean up resources increased shipping in this area would require substantial investments in ships emergency preparedness infrastructure and weather forecasting systems for a route that is unpredictable and has a short operational season at present we have no indication that our members view this as commercially interesting rm lavender Larsen points to a belief that thanks to global warming there ll be

interest rates and tariffs mean is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy one in which growth is e tongue sticking out acted to remain at a stable yet underwhelming according to the international monetary fund so what might that mean for all of us exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers a third interest rate cut in a row however stock markets fell sharply because the world s most powerful central banker us federal reserve chair Jerome Powell made clear they should t e tongue sticking out etc as many further cuts in as they might have hoped for as the battle against inflation continues from here it s a new phase and we re going to be cautious about further cuts he said in recent years the oviduct pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly despite that November saw inflation push up in the us euro zone and UK to to and respectively it highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so called last mile of their battle against inflation their target is and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing however the biggest difficulty for global growth is uncertainty and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the us under trump says loos manganese who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan since Donald trump won November s election he s continued to threaten new tariffs against key us trading partners china Canada and Mexico the us is going into a more isolationist policy stance raising tariffs trying to provide more effective protection to us manufacturing says rm manganese and even though that is going to support us growth at least in the short term certainly it s going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the us new tariffs could be particularly devastating for Mexico and Canada but also be harmful to the us according to Maurice obsoleted a former chief economist at the international monetary fund and a previous economic advisor to president Obama he cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries if you disrupt that supply chain you have massive disruptions in the auto market that has the potential to push up prices reduce demand for products and hurt company profits which could in turn drag down investment levels he e tongue sticking out liens rm obsoleted who is now with the Peterson institute for international economics adds introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth could throw the world into recession the tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada s prime minister Justin Trudeau even though the majority of what the us and china sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald trump s first term in office the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world s second biggest economy in the year ahead in his new year address president xi jinking acknowledged the challenges of uncertainties in the external environment but said the economy was on an upward trajectory e tongue sticking out rots of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to china s economy a drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges including weak consumer spending and business investment that the government is trying to tackle those efforts are helping according to the world bank which at the end of December increased its forecast for china s growth from to in Beijing has yet to set a growth target for but thinks it s on course for last year addressing challenges in the property sector strengthening social safety nets and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery according to the world bank s country director for china Mara Warwick those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is more welcoming of foreign investment according to Michael hart who is president of the American chamber of commerce in china tensions between the us and china and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere however rm hart points out that it took to years for china to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer and whilst companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks no one s prepared now to completely replace china one industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles more than million were made in china last year and that dominance led the us Canada and European union EU to impose tariffs on them Beijing says they re unfair and is challenging them at the world trade organization however it s the prospect of Donald trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU restrictions on trade protectionist measures are not conducive to growth and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain the president of the European central bank Christine laggard said last month but in the short term it s probably net inflationary Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe s economic growth but their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that despite a recent uptick in growth the euro zone risks losing momentum in the year ahead that is unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments in the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases according to one survey one barrier to cutting euro zone interest rates is that domestic inflation which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors remains at that s more than double the overall inflation target of and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further it s been similar in the us according to sander van t hornblende the chief executive of grandstand the world s biggest recruitment firm in the us for instance wage inflation is still going to be around in in some western European countries it s even higher than that i think there s two factors there there s the talent scarcity but there s also of course the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do rm van t hornblende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers which is adding upward pressure to general inflation a slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of dynamism from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that he says if the economy is doing well businesses are growing they start hiring people see interesting opportunities and you just start seeing people moving around one person starting a new role in is Donald trump and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the us economy to continue to thrive whilst much won t be revealed before he s back in the white house on January everything points to continued us exceptionalism at the e

researching the impact of so called green industries says north volt presented a save the world mentality that impressed investors media and local politicians but this now or never approach she argues glossed over the fact it was a risk taking start up that never finished attracting investment north volt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans the firm has hired German Marcus endangerment from global electronics company ch connectivity to run north volt s operations in skellefe<c3><a5> from January as it seeks to attract fresh investment north volt s co founder and CEO peter caisson a former teals executive resigned in November as the postmortem into the crisis continues there are debates about the potential impact on

Europe s green transition the region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy alongside north volt high profile companies include strategy formerly called h green steel and hybrid which are both developing fossil free steel using hydrogen but rm cervical the economics commentator argues north volt s downfall has damaged Sweden s very good brand when it comes to green technologies there was a huge opportunity to build this champion and to build this Swedish icon but i think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden he says some local businesses say the publicity around north volt s crisis is already having a negative impact i feel it myself when i travel now even to the southern parts of Sweden and abroad that people really ask me questions says akimbo nor din CEO of skellefte<c3><a5> Kraft a major hydro power and wind energy provider which was an early investor in north volt headquartered in malm<c3><b6>

currently takes place in Europe according to research for international consultancy firm McKinney with Asian firms leading the market Sweden s minister for energy business and industry abbe buss argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer last month she told Swedish television the situation at north volt was not a Swedish crisis rather a reflection of a Europe wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector but while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe s battery industry and the wider green transition it has been accused of sending mixed messages the right wing coalition which came into power in has cut taxes on petrol and diesel and abolished subsidies for es this is a very politically sensitive area says journalist cervical the Swedish government is being actually criticized internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations and that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer the BBC approached buss s media team but was not granted an interview back in skellefte<c3><a5> where it has been dark since just after lunch machismo nor din is preparing to commute home in the snow he says there s a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model despite policymakers being not as ambitious as previous administrations the criteria that enticed north volt to establish its first factory in skellefte<c3><a5> will also attract other big global players to the region according to the energy company CEO it s almost renewable energy up

Correspondent","there are few clearer signs of the destructive power that hurricane beryl unleashed on Barbados in July than the scene at the temporary boatyard in the capital Bridgetown scores of mangled and cracked vessels sit on stacks gaping holes in their hulls their rudders snapped off and cabin windows broken yet these were the lucky ones at least they can be repaired and put back out to sea many others sank taking entire family incomes with them when beryl lashed Barbados the island s fishing fleet was devastated in a matter of hours about of the active fleet was damaged with boats totally destroyed Charles carter who owns a blue and black fishing vessel called Joyce was among those affected it s been real bad i can tell you i had to change both sides of the hull up to the waterline he says pointing at the now pristine boat in front of us it has taken months of restoration and thousands of dollars to get it back to this point during which time Charles has barely been able to fish that s my living my livelihood fishing is all i do he says the fishing industry is mash up echoes his friend captain deride we re just trying to get back the pieces now six months after the storm there are signs of calmer waters on a warm Saturday several repaired vessels were put back into the ocean with the help of a crane a trailer and some government support seeing Joyce back on the water is a welcome sight for all fishermen in Barbados but Barbadians are acutely aware that climate change means more active and powerful Atlantic hurricane seasons and it may be just another year or two before the fishing industry is struck again beryl for example was the earliest forming category storm on record few understand the extent of the problem better than the island s chief fisheries officer rd Shelly Ann cox our captains have been reporting that sea conditions have changed she e tongue sticking out liens higher swells sea surface temperatures are much warmer and they re having difficulty getting flying fish now at the beginning of our pelagic season the flying fish is a national symbol in Barbados and a key part of the island s cuisine but climate change has been harming the stocks for years at the insisting fish market in Bridgetown flying fish are still available along with marlin magi magi and tuna though only a handful of stalls are open at one of them Cornelius Harrington from the freedom fish house fillets a king fish with the speed and dexterity of a man who has spent many years with a fish knife in his hands beryl was like a surprise attack like an ambush says Cornelius in a deep baritone voice over the market s chatter reggae and thwack of cleavers on chopping boards Cornelius lost one of his two boats in hurricane beryl it s the first time a hurricane has come from the south like that normally storms hit us from the north he said although his second boat allowed him to stay afloat financially Cornelius thinks the hand of climate change is increasingly present in the fishermen s fate right now everything has changed the tides are changing the weather is changing the temperature of the sea the whole pattern has changed the effects are also being felt in the tourism industry he says with hotels and restaurants struggling to find enough fish to meet demand each month for rd Shelly Ann cox public education is key and she says the message is getting through perhaps because we are an island and we re so connected to the water people in Barbados can speak well on the impact on climate change and what that means for our country she says i think if you speak to children as well they re very knowledgeable about the topic to see for myself i visited a secondary school Harrison college as a member of a local no the Caribbean youth environmental network yen talked to members of the school s environmental club about climate change the yen representative Sheldon Marshall is an energy e tongue sticking out err who quizzed the pupils about greenhouse gases and the steps they could take at home to help reduce carbon emissions on the island how can you as young people in Barbados help make a difference on climate change he asked them following an engaging and lively debate i asked the pupils how they felt about Barbados being on the front line of global climate change despite having only a small carbon footprint itself personally i take a very pessimistic view said year old Isabella firebricks we are a very small country no matter how hard we try to change if the big countries the main producers of pollution like America India and china don t make a change everything we do is going to be pointless her classmate tenuous ram sham is slightly more optimistic i think that all great big leaps in history were made when people collaborated and innovated she argues i don t think we should be completely disheartened because research innovation creating technology and education will ultimately lead to the future that we want i feel if we can communicate to the global superpowers the pain that we feel seeing this happen to our environment adds year old quadrille bared then it would help them to understand and help us collaborate to find ways to fix the issues that we re seeing for the island s young people their very futures are at stake rising sea levels now pose an existential threat to the small islands of the Caribbean it is a point on which the prime minister of Barbados MIA mottle has become a global advocate for change urging greater action over an impending climate catastrophe in her speech at cop and calling for economic compensation from the world s industrialized nations on its shores and in its seas it feels like Barbados is under siege dealing with issues from coral bleaching to coastal erosion while the impetus for action comes from the island s youth it is the older generations who have borne witness as the changes unfold Steven borne has fished the waters around Barbados his whole life and lost two boats in hurricane beryl as we look out at the coastline from a dilapidated beach hut bar he says the island s sands have shifted before his very eyes it s an attack from the elements you see it taking the beaches away but years ago you d be sitting here and you could see the water s edge coming upon the sand now you can t because the sand s built up so much by coincidence in the same bar where i chatted to Steven was home affairs minister Wilfred grahams who has responsibility for national disaster management i put it to him that it must be a a difficult time for disaster management in the Caribbean the whole landscape has changed entirely he replied once upon a time it was rare to get a category five hurricane in any year now we re getting them every year so the intensity and the frequency are cause for concern even the duration of the hurricane season has changed he says we used to have a rhyme that went June too soon July standby October all

series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments ovarian cancer is rare underfunded and deadly says Audra roman head of the ovarian cancer research alliance okra a global charity based in new York like all cancers the earlier it is detected the better most ovarian cancer starts in the Fallopian tubes so by the time it gets to the ovaries it may have already spread elsewhere too five years prior to ever having a symptom is when you might have to detect ovarian cancer to affect mortality says ms roman but new blood tests are emerging that use the power of artificial intelligence AI to spot signs of the cancer in its very early stages and it s not just cancer AI can also speed up other blood tests for potentially deadly infections like pneumonia rd denial Heller is a biomedical engineer at memorial Sloan Kettering cancer center in new York his team have been developed a testing technology which uses nanotube tiny tubes of carbon which are around times smaller than the diameter of a human hair about years ago scientists began discovering nanotube that can emit fluorescent light in the past decade researchers learned how to change these nanotube properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood now it is possible to put millions of nanotube into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them but that still left the question of interpreting the signal which rd Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint in this case the fingerprint is a pattern of molecules binding to sensors with different sensitivities and binding strengths but the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out we can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all he says we can only see the patterns that are different with AI decoding the nanotube data meant loading the data into a machine learning algorithm and telling the algorithm which samples came from patients with ovarian cancer and which from people without it these included blood from people with other forms of cancer or other gynecological disease that might be confused with ovarian cancer a big challenge in using AI to develop blood tests for ovarian cancer research is that it is relatively rare which limits the data for training algorithms and much of even that data is soloed in hospitals that treated them with minimal data sharing for researchers rd Heller describes training the algorithm on available data from just a few patients as a hail Mary pass but he says the AI was able to get better accuracy than the best cancer bio markers that are available today and that was just the first try the system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors and samples from many more patients more data can improve the algorithm just as algorithms for self driving cars can improve with more testing on the street rd Heller has high hopes for the tech what we d like to do is triage all gynecological disease so when someone comes in with a complaint can we give doctors a tool that quickly tells them it s more likely to be a cancer or not or this cancer than that rd Heller says this may be three to five years away it s not just early detection that AI is potentially useful for it is also speeding up other blood tests for a cancer patient catching pneumonia can be deadly and as there are around different organisms that can cause pneumonia doctors have to conduct multiple tests to identify the infection but new types of blood tests are simplifying and speeding up the process kaiser based in California uses artificial intelligence AI to help identify the precise pneumonia pathogen in hours and select the right antibiotic for it before our test a patient with pneumonia would have to different tests to identify their infection in just in their first week in hospital that s about in testing says Darius chief executive lace ford Darius has a database of microbial DNA which has tens of billions of data points test samples from patients can be compared to that database to identify the exact pathogen rm ford says that would have been impossible without AI one challenge is that researchers don t necessarily currently understand all the connections that an AI might make between the test bio markers and the diseases over the last two years rd slav<c3><a9> petrologist has developed an AI platform called Milton that using bio markers in the UK bio bank data to identify diseases with a success rate of over finding patterns in such a mass of data is only something that AI can do these are often complex patterns where there may not be one bio marker but you have to take into consideration the whole pattern says rd petrologist whose is a researcher at pharmaceuticals giant strangeness rd Heller uses a similar pattern matching technique in his work on ovarian cancer we know that the sensor binds and responds to proteins and small molecules in the blood but we don t know which of the proteins or molecules are specific to cancer he says more broadly data or the lack of it is still a drawback people earn t sharing their data or there s not a mechanism to do it says ms roman okra is funding a large scale patient registry with electronic medical records of patients who be allowed researchers to train algorithms on their data it s early days we re still in the wild west of AI now says ms roman"

forbidding hill about half an hour s drive from the center of Damascus in the last few days the entrance has been repainted in the green white and black of Syria s revolutionary flag the new colors did not dispel the sinister atmosphere of the place as i walked through the gates i thought of the despair that must have gripped the thousands of Syrians who made the same journey one estimate is that more than detainees were killed in naysayer in the years since the start of the Syrian war in that is a large proportion of the more than people almost all men but including thousands of women as well as children who disappeared without trace into bash AL Assad s gulag other parts of Assad s prison system were less cruel phone calls home were allowed and families were allowed to visit but naysayer was the dark and rotten heart of the regime fear of being consigned there and killed without anyone knowing what had happened was a central part of the Assad regime s system of coercion and repression the authorities did not have to tell families who had been incarcerated there allowing them to fear the worst was another way of applying pressure the regime kept its boot on the throat of Syrians because of the power reach and savagery of its myriad and overlapping intelligence agencies and because of the routine use of torture and execution i was in other infamous prisons in the days after they were liberated including ab slim the former Libyan leader colonel gadding s notorious jail in Tripoli and pool e charlie outside Kabul in Afghanistan neither were as foul and pestilent as naysayer in its overcrowded cells men had to urinate into plastic bags as their access to latrines was limited when the locks were smashed open they left behind their filthy rags and scraps of blankets which were all they had to cover themselves as they slept on the floor torture and execution have already been documented in naysayer in the months to come it is certain that more information about the horrors perpetrated inside its walls will emerge from former inmates in naysayer s corridors you can see how hard it will be to mend the country Assad broke to try to save his regime now that the prison has been broken open like the country it has become a microcosm of all the challenges Syria faces since the Assad regime crumpled and was swept away one challenge is making a record of exactly what the regime did to its victims in a sign of how far Syria has come in just a week volunteers went to the prison to try to preserve naysayer s records paperwork is scattered around offices and even on the concrete floor of the prison yard families pick up files and sheets of tattered documentation trying to find a name a date or a place that they recognize the disarray of the records looks as if someone tried to destroy what was done here in the name of bash AL Assad s Syria when dictators and their henchmen fall making sure they don t take the truth with them is a big part of a better future a musician called savanna baklava gave her group of volunteers face masks and blue nitrite gloves along with instructions about photographing and collecting documents savanna admitted they were amateurs and said they were taking matters into their own hands because the international human rights groups were not there and evidence and documents were disappearing even if one family gets one answer that their loved on is not here anymore is deceased or he died in the hospital it is enough for me savanna told me it is very chaotic where are the international origination supposed to be documenting all this chaos it is not just about families getting some release through at least knowing what happened to the disappeared one day there might be trials of the perpetrators documents are evidence the truth the volunteers uncovered with their own eyes shocked them all Syrians knew that the prisons were bad but naysayer was much worse than they e tongue sticking out acted widow labial one of the volunteers took off her face mask and broke down in tears after an hour or so looking for evidence in the cell blocks what i be seen here is a life not fit for humans i imagined how they lived their clothes how did they breathe how did they eat how did they feel it s terrible terrible there are bags of urine on the floor they could t go to the toilet so they had to put urine in bags the smell there s no sun or light i can t believe people were living here when we were living and breathing our normal lives it will be hard for Syrians and their new rulers to track down the people they want to punish bash AL Assad fled to Russia with his family his brother masher with a reputation for violence and corruption as bad as anyone in his extended family is thought to be in Iraq a couple of Assad s cousins ran into rebel fighters as they tried to escape to Lebanon one of them according to Reuters news agency was killed in the resulting shootout when i entered Syria a week ago hundreds of cars full of despondent and scared families with some link to the regime who believed they would be in danger in the new Syria were leaving queuing to get over the border into Lebanon at the same time hundreds were driving in the opposite direction desperate to get home eventually there might be a legal process to prosecute bash AL Assad members of his family and some of those who carried guns for the regime gathering evidence would be part of that but the exodus in the last hours of the regime and in the confused days and nights that followed means that it will be hard to get to the people responsible at naysayer prison families wander through the building desperate for information searching for those they be lost horrified by everything they are seeing just being in naysayer s cells and corridors freezing cold in December reinforces a widespread desire to see the punishment of everyone implicated in the Assad regime s crimes a group of men gathered in the prison yard smoking silently some leafing through files that they had picked up off the ground all those i spoke to said that the future must be built on justice for the past the men in the group all looking for missing sons brothers and cousins called naysayer a mass grave they want the head of bash AL Assad literally they murmured agreement when one of them said he had to be decapitated one of them a young man called Ahmed said he knew the brother he was searching for was alive because he could see him in his dreams Ahmed himself had spent three years in naysayer it was so bad the torture the food everything we were suffering mo hammed halal an older man had been searching for his son jab since he was dragged from the family breakfast table by thugs from one of the state s intelligence agencies in we are many people came from qualmish has aka dare AL our AL paraquat looking for our loved ones thousands are still in the streets looking for their children it s not just me inside one of the cell blocks young men from Aleppo were warming themselves on a fire that they had lit in a metal tin burning old prison uniforms that are scattered around every cell they were looking for brothers who had been detained and then disappeared like many others looking for information or a body at naysayer the men had no money for a hotel so they camped in the prison where they believe their brothers were consigned and most likely killed one of the men from Aleppo neediness phalli wants news of a brother taken by the regime on September they all know the precise dates we don t know if he is alive or dead if he is dead they should give us his body they should tell us if he s dead we just want to know we want to know what to do next his friend mo hammed radian was looking for a brother and a cousin who were detained in rumors were flying around that the night before the fall of the regime freezer lorries were brought to the prison to remove bodies the rumors have not been confirmed but mo hammed and neediness were convinced that they were true mo hammed looked exhausted and his anger flared up he addressed himself to Assad where did you pig take the fridge trucks everyone who took part in this crime and everyone who served her in naysayer prison should be brought to justice everyone even if they were working in cleaning they should all be brought to account because if they knew what was happening at least they should have told the families of the prisoners that their dear ones were killed slaughtered hanged or tortured both men ended with an Islamic prayer Allah is sufficient for me and he is the best disposer of affairs their hunger to see Assad and his men punished could become one of the drivers of events in the next few months Syrians want to see their tormentors punished the extended Assad clan used Syria as their bank account they helped themselves to stakes in businesses that might make profits they controlled the lucrative market for telecommutes and mobiles as they raked in cash Syrians struggled to eke out a living in an economy smashed by war and drained dry by rapacious and corrupt regime favorites the new rulers of Syria have inherited big debts and an almost worthless currency a couple of hundred dollars equals a plastic trash bag of bundles of Syrian pounds corruption extended to the prison system victims and families desperate to avoid years in a hell hole were prepared to pay big money to stay out assassin ab dishware served years under sentence of death for terrorism which was the word the Assad regime used for rebellion assassin a quietly spoken man who is now denies he ever joined an armed group instead he says he was detained at a government office when he was getting documents necessary to apply for a passport so he could accept an offer to study in Canada his brother said the family paid a total of in bribes on five separate occasions to try to get him out in all cases the corrupt officials who had offered help for cash pocketed the money without releasing assassin a couple of weeks before the regime collapsed yet another corrupt judge offered to free assassin for another after his arrest assassin ab dishware was tortured when he was detained for days at a military intelligence interrogation center among other injuries the torturers broke one of his legs assassin says he was with one of his cellmates a year old man when he died after three days of torture the jailers recorded death from a stroke assassin was overjoyed to get home when my mother held me after years i can t describe the feeling there is nothing like going back to your home and neighborhood but like many Syrians assassin s optimism about the future starts with determination that the fallen regime s leaders and acolytes should suffer for their deeds they should be punished we are human souls not stones after all and those who killed should be publicly executed otherwise we won t get through this we need to forget and move on this is a happiness for all Syrians we need to return to our work and responsibility to continue we need to forget we turned the page all the sadness is behind us the leader of hay at tapir AL sham has started using his real name Ahmed AL sharia instead of his war time pseudonym ab mo hammed AL lanolin the name change contains a message about looking ahead the evidence is that Ahmed AL sharia will need to priorities justice for the deposed regime if he does not want the chaos of people taking matters into their own hands the future is hard and the past is full of pain here in Damascus it feels as if a collective weight has been lifted from the shoulders of a nation Syrians know how deep their problems go to preserve the optimism created by Assad s fall Syrians want to see progress"

prettiest girl or please bring yourself down you have too much confidence she says to the BBC from her new York city apartment win ta is part of a growing group of online creators making rage bait content where the goal is simple record videos produce memes and write posts that make other users viscerally angry then bask in the thousands or even millions of shares and likes it differs from its internet cousin click bait where a headline is used to tempt a reader to click through to view a video or article as marketing pod caster Andrea Jones notes a hook reflects what s in that piece of content and comes from a place of trust whereas rage baiting content is designed to be manipulative but the grip negative content has on human psychology is something that is hardwired into us according to rd William Brady who studies how the brain interacts with new technologies in our past this is the kind of content that we really needed to pay attention to he e tongue sticking out liens so we have these biases built into our learning and our attention the growth in rage baiting content has coincided with the major social media platforms paying creators more for their content these creator programs which reward users for likes comments and shares and allow them to post sponsored content have been linked to its rise if we see a cat we re like oh that s cute and scroll on but if we see someone doing something obscene we may type in the comments this is terrible and that sort of comment is seen as a higher quality engagement by the algorithm e tongue sticking out liens marketing pod caster andr<c3><a9>a Jones the more content a user creates the more engagement they get the more that they get paid and so some creators will do anything to get more views even if it is negative or inciting rage and anger in people she says with a note of concern it leads to disengagement rage bait content comes in many forms from outrageous food recipes to attacks on your favorite pop star but in a year of global elections particularly in the us rage baiting has spread to politics too as rd Brady observes there has been a spike in the build up to elections because it s an effective way to mobilize your political group to potentially vote and take action he notes the American election was light on policy and instead centered around outrage adding it was hyper focused on trump is horrible for this reason or Harris is horrible for that reason an investigation from BBC social media investigations correspondent marijuana spring found some users on x were being paid thousands of dollars by the social media site for sharing content including misinformation AI generated images and unfounded conspiracy theories some who study the trends are concerned that too much negative content can lead to the average person switching off it can be draining to have such high emotions all the time says Ariel hazel assistant professor of communication and media at the university of Michigan it turns them off the news environment and we re seeing increased amounts of active news avoidance around the world others worry about normalizing anger offline and the eroding effects on people s trust in the content they view algorithms amplify outrage it makes people think it s more normal says social psychologist rd William Brady he adds what we know from certain platforms like x is that politically extreme content is actually produced by a very small fraction of the user base but algorithms can amplify it as if they were more of a majority the BBC contacted the main social media platforms about rage bait on their sites but had no responses in October meta executive Adam mossier posted on threads about an increase in engagement bait on the platform adding we re working to get it under control while eon musk s rival platform x recently announced a change to its creator revenue sharing program which will see creators compensated based on engagement from the site s premium users such as likes replies and reposes previously compensation was based on ads viewed by premium users ticktock and you tube allow users to make money from their posts or to share

how AI is changing medical research and treatments the heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ but has no blood flowing through it nor does it live in a human body it s a computer generated heart or digital twin used to test implantable cardiovascular devices like stents and prosthetic valves that once confirmed they are safe will eventually be used on real people but the heart s creators silicosis have gone beyond just creating one accurate model using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data they have created multiple different hearts these AI generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight age gender and blood pressure but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds as these differences often earn t represented in clinical data digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials or trials involving just digital twins without AI this allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses which is not possible using conventional methods this use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer says silicosis chief executive Sheena McPherson in an investigation by the international consortium of investigative journalists revealed that deaths and over million injuries were caused by medical devices ms McPherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers to really make these devices safer you need to test them more thoroughly and it sin t feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the e tongue sticking out ens of it says ms McPherson who is based in timberland so you want to be able to use the computer generated version to make sure that whatever you re doing you be tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human even a fraction of those deaths and the associated lawsuits could have been avoided with more thorough testing you can also get more detailed results you could take the same virtual heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure or against different disease progression to see whether that affects the device in any way ms McPherson adds virtual testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights it also means that we can test in other sub patient groups not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on silicosis s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data and data from real MRI and ct scans that includes medical imaging from consenting patients the data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies silicosis s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI generated simulation it all takes place inside a computer where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts all AI simulated versions of a real human heart human and animal trials on the other hand tend to involve just hundreds of participants perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes which translates into big cost savings too drug manufacturer sanserif for example hopes to reduce the testing period by while also increasing the success rate it is using digital twin technology in its immunology oncology and rare disease specialism using biological data from real people sanserif creates AI based simulated patients not actual clones of specific individuals that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial sanserif s AI programmed also then creates computer generated models of the drug to be tested synthesizing properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body so it can be tested on the AI patients the programmer predicts their reactions too replicating the real trial process with a failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development an increase of just in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in m in savings given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials says Matt support sanserif s global head of research platforms and computational research and development the results so far have been promising rm support who is based in Boston us adds there is still a lot to do many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex this is where tools like AI come in powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier digital twins might have weaknesses though says charlie Paterson an associate partner at pa consulting and a former nos service manager he points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on due to aged data collection methods and low representation of marginalized populations we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we re programming virtual recreations of individuals working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue sanserif is aware of and working to resolve to fill gaps in its internal data sets made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year it sources data from third parties like electronic health records and bio banks back at silicosis ms McPherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process a virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog cow sheep or pig which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies she says"

do was play football to improve the game for girls it did t matter where we went the doors were slammed in our face why were we ostracized that was the male attitude in Scotland in those days the women should be at the sink they should t be daring to pull on football boots among those unhappy at her passion for football included her husband who asked her to resign as secretary because he would not tolerate the idea that women played football he gave her an ultimatum she recalls it s either me or the football she traveled to Edinburgh intending to resign as the secretary and instead they made her the manager of the Scotland team i had to go back home and tell him you can imagine how he felt i had to go and take the route that i intended to take i had no option it cost me my husband she adds i was a football suffragette i had to prove that women could play football simple cook was heavily involved in that first match from sewing badges on shirts to arranging the per match transport although Scotland player jean hunter recalls not everything going to plan we were all waiting on this coach coming to pick us up and obviously it never arrived the next thing Elsie said you

i always hitchhiked from crew to London there was no money i had no choice she said who had money in those days i could t afford a train ticket i slept there in a station overnight and i thumbed it back home the next day when somebody loves football as much i did and still do you ll do anything Wendy Owen won her first cap in England s second game away to France in April for the first match

lock down with people inspired to get green fingered in the tiniest of spaces but did they produce bumper crops or snacks for snails with cooking if it goes wrong you can try again the next night says Newcastle based mark rids dill smith who runs the container gardening forum vertical veg but with growing you have to wait a whole year before you can go again in June sheila brand had big ambitions for her third floor balcony she had already picked raspberries radishes and courgettes and was growing tomatoes aubergines herbs and even pumpkins which she hoped to harvest in October but then the snails arrived they ate everything there was nothing left out of all the pumpkins i had sown and grown she said she was heartbroken but will try again in the spring although she s not sure how to ward off another huge invasion right now i m not growing much at all just the standard herbs just outside my door for easy access while i m cooking my balcony looks very sad she says mark s advice there are loads of anti snail products but really the best way is to go out at night with a torch and spend five minutes picking them off alternatively look under pots or in other shady places and remove them in daylight for real ale enthusiast Colin cone it began when his sister gave him six pots containing tiny tomato seedlings his second floor flat has no outside space so they sat on his living room window sill inside the glass in perfect greenhouse conditions Colin who chairs the north London branch of the campaign for real ale made sure they were well watered by July the tomato plants were nearly m high at night they pushed out the curtains by day they blocked out the light he propped them up at first on canes and later on strings attached to the curtain pole they grew and they grew and they grew when you re dealing with a forest eventually i had to cut them back he says despite an influx of aphids all the plants produced fruit and Colin ate a lot of tomato salad it s encouraged me to try again i be certainly got the bug he said although next year he plans to stick to smaller plants like basil thyme or sage he s also saved seeds from a chill plant which was his other crop although he s not convinced by the flavor it nearly blew my head off he says mark s advice not all tomato plant varieties are enormous look for varieties labeled balcony or tumbling which might be a better fit herbs like basil or thyme would do very well in such a warm location chill plants are a good idea but try a milder variety with aphids he says it s about managing the population smaller plants can be taken outside turned upside down tapped a few times and the aphids will jump off otherwise just squish them he says healthcare worker Shana Evans can see the sea from her balcony flat in painting Devon and is hoping her lettuce rocket kale and spinach will provide fresh greens all winter in the summer she also grew several types of tomato radishes peas beans cucumbers herbs and courgettes the plants created a true edible jungle it s truly been my little retreat and a sanctuary of peace her high rise garden attracted bees and butterflies and a family of goldfinches which fed on seeds from the cornflowers she grew but packing in so much had a downside the plants have been competing for space and light a bit which eventually brought in a few pests and her courgettes never reached full size although they were delicious small mark s advice plant spacing is partly trial and error and it s definitely worth giving fruiting plants like courgettes a bit more room i think she s done an amazing job Richard chamberlain s four south west facing window ledges have seen prolific growth first with kale and spring onions and then replanted with tomatoes and courgettes which are still steadily producing an e tongue sticking out experienced gardener who grew up on a fruit and veg farm in Essex Richard s career as a business consultant has taken him to Florida and California where vegetables just whoosh he checks on the plants at the start of each day but i don t talk to them he says he would do some things differently next year the kale was OK there were about eight plants i made the mistake of not harvesting as soon as i should have done i actually cooked some and tried to eat it but the stalks were too woody in the mouth mark says kale varieties like cavalry Nero and red Russian can be tender enough to eat uncooked he says but plants can become bitter or woody if they dry out so be extra careful in hot dry weather particularly with small pots which can dry out fast Robyn wiles and her partner Alex improvised by using wooden pallets hung on the walls of their patio in Nottingham as planters to grow sillies peppers tomatoes spring onions and herbs the sillies went into stir fries and have a surprising kick for such little things while the tomatoes and spring onions have been lovely in our lunch salads and we made fresh pesto with our basil Robyn has less time for gardening now she s back working full time as a physiotherapist but hopes to try again next year ideally e tongue sticking out sanding from pallets into pots for more growing room mark says if you re short of time larger containers can be a boon as they retain moisture which means missing a day s watering won t be a disaster also think about perennial rather than annual plants unlikely perennials for containers include blackberries and blueberries and you can get a purple raspberry that does well plus oregano or sage and more unusual herbs like lavage or savory mark even has a container grown apple tree which produces about apples each year his main advice when things go wrong is not to lose heart and to accept that learning might be slow a little bit of the right information can make all the difference when i started off i had loads of things go wrong loads of disasters but it s all part of the fun"

conical sides a shape that s stable when the capsule is plummeting at high speed through the earth s atmosphere but it has more autonomy than either the Apollo spacecraft or the shuttle Boeing s vehicle travels to the ISS and docks with little to no intervention from astronauts it s also designed to be safer unlike the space shuttle star liner has an escape system that can propel the crew away from its rocket if an emergency occurs during launch the spacecraft s full name is star liner CST CST stands for crew space transportation and refers to the k<c3><a1>rm<c3><a1>n line the official boundary of space km above the earth the vehicle comes in two main parts which are attached to each other from launch until shortly before re entry the internal core of the crew module is called the pressure vessel and is manufactured in two halves each half is made from a single piece of metal rather than from different pieces welded together eliminating welds reduces the chance of defects that could weaken the structure after the two halves of the vessel are sealed together the sloping sides are enclosed within a protective envelope called the back shell blankets made of silica and woven glass cover the outside but areas that receive more heating on re entry are shielded with ceramic tiles like those used on the space shuttle the crew module measures m at its base with a cabin that accommodates up to seven crew NASA missions will take between four and five passengers per flight swapping the seats for extra cargo storage if the fifth seat is vacant Boeing has the option to sell it to a space tourist or carry an astronaut from another country the control console has two display screens while space opted for touchscreens in its crew dragon vehicle Boeing went for the traditional approach of switches and buttons because most spacecraft operations are automated crew members won t have to engage much with the vehicle but if for any reason they have to assume manual

their own countries choose to enter Brazil on the edge of town where the paved road runs out and where the jungle meets the last few buildings several times a day small convoys of mini vans come down the track and people get out like new arrivals anywhere they look slightly bewildered trying to get an immediate bearing on their surroundings but they have little need to worry for the time being this is quite possibly one of the most welcoming places on the planet for a migrant or refugee to arrive the people arriving here at the state migration center in the town of Rio bronco are mainly from Haiti central America Senegal and beyond while many will claim asylum as refugees they are nearly all economic migrants and are recognized as such it started as an informal bilateral understanding between Brazil and Haiti after Brazil s commitment to Haiti following the earthquake of since then word spread and now many more of the people arriving here are coming from as far afield as west Africa some of them like Matthew from Nigeria have gone through an awful lot to get here i came here to escape the Islamist militant group book harm and the Muslim christian fighting in the Nigerian town of hos Matthew tells me as he nervously holds on to his bible my father was forced to convert but my mother was killed in our church as for my sister they took her and i be not seen her for a long time Matthew says that he arrived here through Ecuador and pure the journey is long but thankfully not as arduous as that faced by African migrants fleeing through the Sahara towards Europe more than people a day are arriving at this holding center just a couple of hours drive from the Bolivian border Spanish french patois the languages and dialects are sometimes difficult to pick out everyone is processed fed and given a mattress to sleep on among the migrants i spoke to was jenny from the Dominican republic Brazil s well known as the place to come the Haitians told us that says jenny who has a pretty sure idea of what she plans to do next now that she has made it to Brazil i m going to the south to get a job in Santa ocarina i already have friends down there but despite the smiles and optimism jenny has made sacrifices i be got two kids my mum and dad back home it was hard to leave them but i have to earn money to send home Brazil s policy so far has been to allow most if not all of the migrants and refugees in partly because the borders here are so porous and there is a demand for migrant labor as the economy has boomed in recent years some residents and officials in the state of acre are concerned that the constant influx of refuges will eventually reach unsustainable levels some even describe it as a crisis however the Brazilian government does not generally talk about a refugee problem even though in recent years more than migrants from Haiti alone have come here according to official figures less than of the population is made up of migrants decimal anionic DE limey works as a human rights co coordinator here in acre there s always been work for them because they ll accept the jobs Brazilians don t want says the official word has spread and for the migrants it s like a kind of e radon anionic DE limey also dismisses out of hand recent reports in some Brazilian newspapers that there were concerns about Ebola coming into Brazil through the camp they were not being complacent he said but no one was being sent away because of their nationality and they were confident that nobody had arrived from an Ebola affected area there is some tension here between the different nationalities and they all keep to their own parts of the center but conditions are immeasurably better than at other migrant camp i have seen as the day progresses everybody is anxiously waiting for one thing the appearance of Brazilian work permits dozens of them an orderly but excited group of people crowd around a small table set out in the shade of a huge tree as the names are read out french sounding names from Haiti a few Dominicans and several Senegalese are among those the Brazilian official struggles to get right but no one seems to care less than two weeks after arriving many of these migrants now have extensive rights to live and work in Brazil having secured temporary visas for a year the lucky ones have few words but the smiles on their faces say it all most of them are planning to head south in particular to Rio grand do soul and Santa ocarina where there is still reportedly plenty of work for them in agriculture and in factories although the work is invariably poorly paid and unstable many of the people leaving here already have friends and family members in the south those whose names were not called out return to playing football or sitting in the shade for those moving on discrimination and a slowing economy will present challenges as dusk falls over the jungle new migrants still arrive just as bewildered and bleary eyed after their long journey as the group who arrived that morning and this will continue as long as Brazil makes them feel welcome"

mixture of highs and lows after he truly burst on the global scene as a teenager at euro and Rooney will forever be associated with an outstanding group of club players who could not replicate their domestic and European success at international level Rooney did not score at a world cup until his third attempt eventually netting against Uruguay in Brazil in but he was also a player who carried England on so many occasions and his place in the history books is testimony to his outstanding contribution over so many years he performed selflessly often in unfamiliar roles and his commitment was

impose it upon him if it was up to him he would play every minute every second former England and Manchester united teammate Phil Seville says Rooney s international retirement is a sad day as he is England s greatest ever goalscorer i remember when he first got into the squad the youthfulness the bravery the courage that he showed particularly in his first major tournament at euro Seville told BBC radio live he was a breath of fresh air no one enjoyed playing for England more than Wayne Rooney Seville added it s obviously a day we should be celebrating but also it s a sad day losing one of

civilian life flashbacks from kosher and a difficult transition to civilian life culminated in a mental health crisis to mark international women s day ms Morgan now a speaker leadership coach and mental health campaigner living in cottonmouths shares what she learn from stepping over the patriarchal line the ministry of defense mod said great strides had been made but it was grateful to current and former servicewomen whose testimony makes clear that on too many occasions defense failed to provide adequate support my choice to join the army in was unconventional i was stepping outside of traditional gender boundaries through school i was taught that girls could have it all but the hard truth was by becoming a female soldier i became an immediate outlier at the royal military academy sandstorm we were one of the first intakes to do the same training as the men female platoons were kept separate and only a handful of roles were open to women but it felt exciting to step over the patriarchal line i became accustomed to a hyper masculine environment and assumed the behaviors to fit in no one actually says it or writes it down but i understood that i would need to perform to a much higher standard to succeed inevitably i became more masculine no make up no heels anything to blend in my tone turned more assertive and direct my presence more commanding i began cursing profanities mid sentence with my peers you did t want to be the girl in the army that looks weak because they already thought that you were weak i learned to hide any sense of vulnerability to hold this veneer of defiant perfection at all times no one told me about the dangers of the double bind being masculine enough to prove yourself but not so much that you are a threat or being too feminine and considered weak the army taught me that i was capable of achieving so much more than i ever imagined i miss being a sister in the brotherhood the connection the teamwork and knowing that someone has your back i miss the adrenaline the discipline and the focus in life but i do not miss wearing men s combat boots in a smaller size because they don t make kit for women i do not miss wearing a uniform that cut across my boobs and thighs i do not miss the less palatable side as a troop commander i was sexually assaulted it was Christmas drinks with officers going to the sergeants mess as i was leaving a senior soldier approached and forced me into a small closet where the public phone was found i remember the stench of his breath his hands lunging at my body i did t complain i did t know who to turn to or what to say uninvited groping was commonplace at the bar or under the table at formal dinner nights groups of men would run scorecards with names of nightly conquests listed down the side one officer s party trick was to weigh your breasts leaning in to mumble his cheeks against your cleavage for good measure it was accepted as a jovial part of army life from day one we learned that such behavior was part of the deal in training a male officer would let himself into our rooms and we would wake to find him standing over our beds in the middle of the night there was a complaint but no meaningful action was taken at the regiment soldiers mounted their walls with hard core pornography before a room inspection when i asked for it to be removed i was laughed at branded frigid and uptight it was persistent and seemingly endless but i learned to let it all wash over me it was simply a fact of life in many respects i was lucky my physical strength meant that i could hold my own among st the men and comfortably meet the fitness standards required in i was ranked the best young officer in the corps and awarded the Carmen sword by the princess royal i remember arriving at my new posting and when the colonel welcomed me i could no longer have the role that had been assigned he had been decided that they did not want a woman being the face of the corps to use his words precisely i was the best person for the job but not the right person it felt almost impossible to be a good army officer and a woman at the same time in i captained my country at lacrosse and to the outside world i seemed fine but i was running on fumes profoundly empty and raging inside flashbacks would haunt me meat hanging of shattered limbs eyes without a soul without light behind closed doors vodka Valium and sleeping pills numbed the pain but the nightmares continued aggressive and persistent when the suggestion of mental illness came it terrified me it meant more weakness something that any self respecting soldier would despise the gossip around the regiment shattered my credibility overnight there was no confidentiality nowhere to hide i felt cast out by the brotherhood betrayed by the family that i had worked so hard to be accepted by i left the army of my own accord angry running away perhaps hoping that the nightmares would stop overnight i became a spectator cut off from the military family and struggling to function as a new mother a civilian and a wife the transition was jolting one minute you were in and then you were gone i slept with a weapon next to my bed because it made me more comfortable my game face was set permanently constantly checking behind me scanning the windows and corners i walked with a look designed to make someone think twice life as a new mum awns t what i had imagined i had moved away from this highly disciplined environment into motherhood with a new born baby that would not stop crying i looked for a community in veteran spaces only to find rooms of men drinking pints and telling war stories on remembrance days i felt invisible assumed to be there in support of my husband s former life i joined mum coffee mornings but it felt awkward the acceptable language the dress code the civilian humor i was the product of a masculine culture that did not tolerate femininity outside of the wire my behaviors violated given stereotypes everything the army had taught me was now deemed too assertive too competitive and too masculine for civilian life a woman was somehow e tongue sticking out acted to show a more refined a more subtle and softer side add the additional layer of mental illness and you have a pressure cooker of stigma that was holding on too tight at the age of i tried to take my life i was found by the roadside delirious and choking on my own vomit my imagination led me to barns with burnt corpses hanging off beams i saw ditches with bodies lying face down at around am each morning the same dead boy would stare at me through glazed brown eyes it was exhausting my body became ill as well as my mind today i am immensely proud of my military service and of serving alongside some remarkable women and men but i regret the way that i allowed such toxic masculinity permeate into my life my eyes are now open to the unspoken behavior that others and myself normalized i now value the womanhood that is essential to my being and i have developed the courage to show who i am with vulnerability power and strength all at the same time and in being true to myself i am at last feeling better and sometimes i feel amazing in school we are still teaching that women can have the same opportunities as men the message is still about empowerment that girls can have it all and yet we continue to ignore a more meaningful conversation about what navigating the male leadership space can really look like my eldest daughter has just started her journey into adult life it is for her and for other young women beside her that i will no longer minimize parts of who i am we have a duty to speak out to challenge the status quo no matter what the old boys club may think a mod

carried out a missile test destroying one of its own satellites the action has caused international outrage because the debris could threaten the international space station ISS and satellites in low earth orbit Russia s test of an anti satellite a sat missile system is not the first of its kind back in china tested its own missile system against one of its own weather satellites in orbit the e tongue sticking out lesion created more than pieces of debris the size of a golf ball or larger and more than much smaller pieces of the orbiting fragments considered a threat to the ISS about a third are from this Chinese test and at the speeds these objects travel in orbit even small pieces can threaten spacecraft with destruction the a sat tests fit into the wider issue of space debris which is being made worse by our continued activities in space there is now a wild jungle of junk overhead everything from old rocket stages that continue to loop around the earth decades after they were launched to the flecks of paint that have lifted off once shiny space vehicles and floated off into the distance it is the legacy of years of space activity it s estimated there is close to tonnes of hardware in orbit much of it still active and useful but far too much of it defunct and aimless almost pieces of debris are being tracked on a daily basis these are just the big easy to see items however go below the scale of cm in and objects move around more or less backtracked there may be million of these all of this stuff is traveling at several kilometers per second sufficient velocity for them to become damaging projectiles if any were to strike an operational space mission the threat was starkly demonstrated in when an active communications satellite operated by the us company iridium and a defunct soviet era military communications satellite were obliterated when they collided in orbit now consider the threat to a space vehicle with humans aboard on Monday Russia carried out the a sat test from sleepless chromosome about km miles north of Moscow the missile destroyed an old soviet spy satellite called cosmos that was once part of Russia s semolina radio signals surveillance programmer us state department spokesman end price said the destruction of cosmos had generated about pieces of larger orbiting objects for which tracking information is available to civilian sources but it also created hundreds of thousands of smaller fragments some of these tinier objects likely can be tracked although we won t know because the us military would t want to give away information about its sensor capabilities but other fragments probably are too small to detect from the ground the debris field from the a sat test is found at an altitude of between km and km above earth threatening the ISS china s tangoing space station and other spacecraft when the ISS passed close to the debris cloud on Monday crew members were told to shelter in the Soyuz and crew dragon spacecraft attached to the orbiting outpost this is so that the crew could detach and come back to earth if the space station was damaged by fragments of the satellite while vehicles such as the space shuttle were hit by smaller pieces of debris it s likely that a collision with any large objects at orbital speeds would be catastrophic to the ISS the action by Russia has been condemned by other countries including the us and the UK the Russian military said it was carrying out planned activities to strengthen its defense capabilities but denied the test was dangerous the united states knows for certain that the resulting fragments in terms of test time and orbital parameters did not and will not pose a threat to orbital stations spacecraft and space activities it said many countries now have their own a sat systems the us and Russia and previously the USSR have been developing weapons of this kind since the s in the us used a missile launched from an f fighter jet to destroy the sol wind scientific satellite after the Chinese a sat incident in the us military again shot down one of its own satellites at a lower altitude than the Chinese or Russian operations using a ship launched missile the lower height above the earth was intended to ensure that any debris would quickly burn up in the atmosphere rather than staying aloft to threaten space based assets then in India tested its own weapon during an operation code named mission shakily the missile struck a test satellite in a lower orbit than those targeted by Moscow or Beijing generating more than pieces of traceable debris since modern militarizes rely on satellites for intelligence gathering navigation and communications a sat technologies could be used to undermine an adversary s command and control system during conflict gravity ensures that everything that goes up will eventually come back down but the bath is currently being filled faster than the plug hole and the overflow pipe can empty it some material from the a sat tests will come down to earth out of harm s way but a significant proportion will head off to high altitudes where they will remain a hazard for years to come humans and nature are also conspiring in rune tongue sticking out acted ways to make the situation worse the extra co pumped into the atmosphere down the years has cooled some of its highest reaches the atmosphere this combined with low levels of solar activity have shrunk the atmosphere limiting the amount of drag on orbital objects that ordinarily helps to pull debris from the sky in other words the junk is also staying up longer leaving aside the growth in debris from collisions for a moment the number of satellites being sent into space is also increasing rapidly go back to the s and the average for the number of satellites launched each year would be about in this decade the proliferation of small satellite technologies will likely see the annual average rise above by and large everyone operating in orbit now follows international mitigation guidelines or tries to these include ensuring there is enough propellant at the end of a satellite s life so that it can be pulled out of the sky or at the very least pushed into a graveyard orbit hardware that can t be commanded to DE orbit should have its fuel tanks vented and its batteries disconnected to reduce the chances of an e tongue sticking out lesion a major source of the debris now up there the goal is to make sure all low orbiting material is removed within years of launch however compliance even from well intention ed actors has traditionally been quite poor there are lots of ideas out there to clean up space many of them look far fetched and utterly impractical some of the more sensible proposals have reached the demonstration phase the Japanese UK company astrological is currently in orbit showcasing how it would approach and grab redundant and uncooperative hardware it s likely soon to have to perform this procedure for real on a broadband satellite belonging to the UK operator one web it has a spacecraft in its fleet that has failed at an altitude of more than km at that height the satellite would take many centuries to come down on its own it has been calculated that just taking away a few key spent rocket stages or broken satellites each year would substantially reduce the potential for

the UK s Brexit deal with the EU will break international law concerns had been raised about legislation being brought forward which could change parts of the withdrawal agreement negotiated last year northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis conceded it would go against the treaty in a specific and limited way former pm Theresa may warned the change could damage trust in the UK over future trade deals with other states the permanent secretary to the government legal department sir Jonathan Jones has announced he is resigning from government in light of the bill making him the sixth senior civil servant to leave Whitehall this year sir Jonathan who is the government s most senior lawyer is understood to have believed the plans went too far in breaching the government s obligations under international law labor leader sir heir smarter condemned the bill and accused no of reopening old arguments that had been settled saying the focus should be on getting a trade deal done with the EU no revealed on Monday that it would be introducing a new UK internal market bill that could affect post Brexit customs and trade rules in northern Ireland downing street said it would only make minor clarifications in extremely specific areas but it worried some in Brussels and Westminster that it could see the government try to change the withdrawal agreement which became international law when the UK left the EU in January the row also comes at the start of the eighth round of post Brexit trade deal talks between the UK and the EU the two sides are trying to secure a deal before the end of the transition period on December which will see the UK going onto world trade organization rules if no agreement is reached Irish foreign affairs minister Simon coven called rm Lewis comments gravely concerning adding any unilateral departure from the terms of the withdrawal agreement would be a matter of considerable concern and a very serious step the UK s chief Brexit negotiator lord David frost called for realism from his EU counterparts saying he would drive home our clear message that we must make progress this week if we are to reach an agreement in time the EU said it would do everything in its power to reach an agreement with the UK but will be ready for a no deal scenario on Monday Boris Johnson said if a deal hand t been done by the time the European council meets on October the two sides should move on and accept the UK s exit without one shadow northern Ireland secretary Louise high said it was deeply concerning that the prime minister appeared to be undermining the legal obligations of his own deal with the introduction of the new law while the negotiations are taking place the text of the new bill will not be published until Wednesday although the government has confirmed it will deal with the issue of the so called northern Ireland protocol an element of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland after Brexit the practicalities of the protocol which will deal with issues of state aid financial support given to businesses by governments and whether there needs to be customs checks on goods is still being negotiated by a joint UK and EU committee but rm Lewis said the bill would take limited and reasonable steps to create a safety net if the negotiations failed speaking during an urgent question on the bill chair of the justice committee and troy mp bob Weill said the adherence to the rule of law is not negotiable he asked rm Lewis will he assure us that nothing proposed in this legislation does or potentially might breach international obligations or international legal arrangements the northern Ireland secretary replied yes this does break international law in a very specific and limited way he said the government was still working in good faith with the EU joint committee to overcome its concerns for the future of trade in northern Ireland but said there was clear precedence for UK and indeed other countries needing to consider their obligations if circumstances change sir bob later told BBC radio s pm the decision was troubling adding Britain is a country which prides itself on standing by the rule of law whether it is inconvenient or convenient for us whatever we seek to do if we find something we signed up to inconvenient i am afraid this does t mean we can renege on our contract as that would damage our reputation long term this was an extremely unusual statement a minister standing up in parliament to say the government is planning to break international law Brandon Lewis told the house of commons that there are clear precedents for the UK and other countries needing to consider their international obligations as circumstances change that may suggest says Catherine Barnard professor of law at the university of Cambridge that the government is looking at article of the Vienna convention on the law of treaties which enables a state to get out of its treaty obligations when circumstances change radically but those changed circumstances have to be pretty dramatic something like the dissolution of Yugoslavia when a recognized country ceases to exist in the case of the northern Ireland protocol it is less than a year since the government negotiated the treaty in full knowledge of the sensitivity of the situation and if the government does go ahead with legislation which appears to contradict the withdrawal agreement there is a chance says prof Barnard that the EU will decide to trigger the dispute resolution mechanism in the withdrawal agreement which could lead to arbitration and a case before the European court of justice Theresa may who stood down as prime minister last year after her own Brexit deal failed to get the support of parliament said the united kingdom government signed the withdrawal agreement with the northern Ireland protocol this parliament voted that withdrawal agreement into UK legislation the government is now changing the operation of that agreement how can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs the leader of the liberal democrats sir ed cadaver also called it a sad and shocking state of affairs for our country Sammy Wilson who acts as Brexit spokesman for the northern Irish democratic unionist party said he was pleased to have the new bill that could deal with some of the issues that could affect his constituents such as state aid and customs checks but he said the pud had warned ministers of the impact of the withdrawal agreement early on saying it was a union splitting economy destroying and border creating agreement that has to be changed and replaced he added we will judge this bill on whether it delivers on these kind of issues however Claire Hanna a social democratic and labor party scalp mp for Belfast south said the protocol was a symptom of four years of terrible political decision making she added it is now the law this government is obliged to implement it in full she also cautioned rm Lewis not to use the threat of a border on the island of Ireland or the hard won impartiality of the good Friday agreement as a cat s paw in this or any other negotiation but former conservative leader sir rain Duncan smith said the act that brought the withdrawal agreement into law in the UK allowed the government to reserve the right to make clarifications under the sovereignty clause rm Lewis agreed saying the law would clarify the points about

arrival of the Myanmar junta appointed foreign minister wanna mung win in Bangkok on Wednesday for an unannounced meeting with his Thai and Indonesian counterparts marked the start of a daunting diplomatic undertaking for south east Asia no details were released of what was discussed this first official contact with a senior member of the junta was so delicate that when asked about it Thai prime minister prayer Chan och was unwilling to confirm that it had even happened in fact for every country with an interest in what happens in Myanmar the crisis presents an unusually thorny challenge the responses of the world s military and economic superpowers have inevitably drawn most attention the sanctions imposed by the Biden administration in the united states and those being prepared by the European union there was a predictably bland statement from china merely urging all parties to settle their differences peacefully but china did back a watered down UN security council statement which while it failed to condemn the coup did call for the release of sung San usu KY and a return to democratic norms showing that china was not happy about the coup but both the us and china have limited options over how they deal with the Myanmar crisis the influence of the us is much diminished in this region far lower than the last time it imposed wide ranging economic sanctions in the s yet even those sanctions which helped cripple the Burmese economy had little influence on the decisions made by the then ruling junta the more limited targeted sanctions imposed now are intended to hit only those directly involved in the coup and the military s businesses but will likewise do little to change minds in nay pi raw the crisis has come very early in the Biden administration just as it was beginning to formulate a new approach to the Asia pacific region one which is supposed to emphasis democratic values and also working in co operation with regional partners like the member association of south east Asian nations seaman but like china seaman will not sign up to an approach based on sanctions and condemnation of the junta china looks like a winner from the coup as the one superpower willing to engage with the new regime and keep supplying it with weapons and investment however it is no secret that china was more comfortable dealing with the national league for democracy nod government under which relations had been getting warmer than with an unpredictable military regime which has a deep historical mistrust of its larger neighbor s influence especially over some armed insurgent groups on their common border yet the widespread belief in Myanmar that china is backing the junta is feeding growing anti Chinese sentiment among the millions now protesting against the coup so much so that Chinese officials have been forced to break their customary silence and come out to deny rumors that china is helping the military build an internet firewall or bringing in special forces to help crush the protests the passionate opposition to the coup also raises the specter of longer term instability in Myanmar which threatens china s substantial economic and strategic interests there for all these reasons Beijing will want to tread very carefully the united nations has an unhappy record of engagement in Myanmar the failed missions of several special envoys to promote a democratic opening in the two decades after the uprising the largely fruitless efforts of successive human rights rapporteurs and controversy over the silence of resident UN agencies over the repression of roaring leading up to the atrocities and mass exodus of the current special envoy swiz diplomat Christine scanner burger has the unenviable task of finding the ingredients for a compromise which might lead Myanmar out of the present dangerous confrontation between the military and the people she is seeking a meeting with representatives of the new government as a matter of urgency but any such meeting would be conditional on her also being able to meet sung San usu KY currently detained in an unknown location and could not be seen to give any formal recognition to the junta she will also be coming with a mandate from UN secretary general Antonio gutters who has stated that the coup must be made to fail which will make winning the trust of the generals difficult few believe the coup leader general min sung haling is ready to discuss giving up the power he has seized some of his subordinates may disagree with the coup and recognize the huge risks it poses to Myanmar but the tarmacadam rarely allows differences of opinion within its ranks to show sung San usu KY whose renowned intractability helped her weather years of house arrest may be no more inclined to compromise than the man who deposed her the way the coup has poisoned the ground for any compromise was illustrated by the fate of Indonesia s efforts this week to start an seaman initiative on Myanmar with Myanmar as a member and bound by its customary consensus based decision making and non interference in each other s domestic affairs seaman has particular challenges in addressing this crisis but it must as further confrontation and bloodshed in Myanmar would have serious repercussions for the stability and reputation of the association and in particular for

marsupial began e tongue sticking out lording the possibility of holding a special seaman meeting on Myanmar details of the proposals being discussed with other member states were leaked in particular the idea of holding the junta to its promise of a new election within a year and insisting that sung San usu KY and other nod politicians be released and allowed to contest as a compromise that idea makes some sense but it enraged anti military protesters in Myanmar who argue that last November s election overwhelmingly won by the nod must be honored and that backing a new election rewards the military for overturning the results of the last one and will only encourage them to mount further coups ms marsupial s planned trip to nay pi raw was quickly shelved for all of its weaknesses seaman remains the one forum where senior Burmese officials will be welcomed and where channels of communication remain open it may be best placed to facilitate passing messages to the generals from the rest of the world and hearing back from them their thoughts on how to resolve the crisis the sanctions applied by western countries will not move the generals much at this stage but their removal could be used as the carrot to induce the tarmacadam into moving away from confrontation and repression engagement by Myanmar s Asian neighbors will not move the notoriously xenophobic generals much either but if well coordinated with the pressure applied by the west it might produce positive results the military men who still dominate the government in Thailand have an opportunity here to show statesmanship and to use their close personal ties to min sung haling to e tongue sticking out lore possible openings china s influence will also be critical will it sit back and wait to see if the

retained for a further two years the government said international trade secretary Anne ramie Trevelyan said the plans departed from the UK s international legal obligations but was in the national interest to protect steel makers she added the decision was made due to global disruptions to energy markets and supply chains British steel producers are under pressure from soaring energy prices steel making is a key industry for some parts of the UK where it employs people and turns over b annually without controls the government has warned the supply of steel into the UK could rise substantially harming local manufacturers UK steel previously said ending the import controls could cause as much as m a year in damage speaking at the g summit in Germany at the weekend prime minister Boris Johnson said keeping the import controls on foreign steel would protect metal manufacturers but there were concerns such a decision could breach international law as the question of extending tariffs on steel imports is seen as potentially breaking world trade organization WTO commitments ms Trevelyan said the decision departs from our international legal obligations of a WTO agreement however from time to time issues may arise where the national interest requires action to be taken she added the limits on steel imports were first introduced by the European union in in response to tariffs imposed by the trump administration the controls were mirrored by the UK after Brexit the restrictions which add a tax to steel imports once a certain quota has been reached are known as steel safeguards because they are designed to protect the domestic market from surges of cheap steel from overseas rm Johnson said we need British steel to be provided with much cheaper energy the controls are currently in place for categories of steel while controls protecting of those categories have already been extended to import limits on five categories were set to e tongue sticking out ire on June before the government extended them for two years steel making accounts for just of the UK economy but the material being used in crucial sectors from defense to transport means that it s considered an important industry to shelter from cheaper imports that s why the EU applied tariffs to some types of foreign steel primarily on steel from china in when the UK was a member now the UK has chosen to roll over many of those controls the move which has been e tongue sticking out acted for some months was reported as one reason for the resignation of the prime minister s ethics adviser lord gelid but he later dismissed the issue as a distraction the trade secretary Anne ramie Trevelyan admits the extension of tariffs could be at odds with world trade organization rules but claims it reflects exceptionally challenging times for the industry especially in light of high energy costs she has consulted other countries in the hope of avoiding a challenge in the process attracting controversy for missing a parliamentary hearing on the Australian trade deal with the EU and us also retaining similar tariffs it underlines the tough choices between removing trade barriers and protecting national businesses alabaster semiarid operations director of the steelworkers union community welcomed the extension saying it was extremely important government made the right call because giving up our safeguards when the EU and us are maintaining theirs would leave us e tongue sticking out odes to import surges threatening thousands of jobs he said ms Trevelyan said maintaining tariffs would help defend a strategic industry and that British steel producers could face serious injury were the measures not maintained the government is therefore actively engaged with interested parties including those outside the UK on the future of the UK safeguards and has listened to the concerns raised she added the largest British trade body representing the industry UK steel said the measures were absolutely vital to the long term health of the steel industry in the UK deficient or absent safeguards measures risk trade diversion away from shielded markets elsewhere resulting in surges of imports into the UK said Richard warren head of policy and external affairs at UK steel nick Thomas almonds labor s shadow international trade secretary said the extension of safeguards will come as a welcome relief to the steel sector it is not anti competitive to provide a level playing field for our steel industry he said i also support the decision to exclude Ukrainian steel but some criticized the move saying it would stifle the supply of much needed steel not produced in the UK despite being a step in the right direction the confederation of British metalworkers boss Steve Morley said the tariffs raise the very real prospect of lost orders and production being moved away from the UK British steel mills have not been able

social convention and avoid touching another shaking hands might be one of the hardest customs to lose in the post pandemic world but there are alternatives writes James Jeffrey the humble handshake spans the mundane to the potent ranging from a simple greeting between strangers who will never meet again to the sealing of billion dollar deals between business titans there are various ideas about the origin of the handshake it may have originated in ancient Greece as a symbol of peace between two people by showing that neither person was carrying a weapon or the shaking gesture of the handshake may have started in medieval Europe when knights would shake the hand of others in an attempt to shake loose any hidden weapons the Quakers are credited with popularizing the handshake after they deemed it to be more egalitarian than bowing the handshake is a literal gesture of human disconnectedness a symbol of how humans have evolved to be deeply social tactile orientated animals says pristine regale a psychology professor at the university of taxes at Austin with a history tracing back thousands of years the handshake may be too entrenched to be easily halted the fact we went for the elbow bump as an alternative shows how important touch is we did t want to lose that physical connecting says prof regale that biological drive to touch and be touched is found in other animals as well in the s American psychologist harry Harlow demonstrated how vital touch and affection was for the development of young rhesus monkeys other examples from the animal kingdom include our closest cousins chimpanzees typically touch palms hug and sometimes kiss as a form of greeting giraffes use their necks that can reach two meters in length to engage in a type of behavior called necking with male giraffes entwining their neck with each other s and swaying and rubbing to assess the other s strength and size to establish dominance that said numerous forms of human greeting exist around the world that avoid the transmission trap many cultures embrace pressing the palms of hands together with fingers pointing up while accompanied by a slight bow the traditional Hindu master greeting being one of the most well known in Samoa there is the eyebrow flash that comprises raising your eyebrows while flashing a big smile at the person you are greeting in Muslim countries a hand over a heart is a respectful way to greet someone you are not accustomed to touching and there is the Hawaiian Shaka sign adopted and popularized by American surfers made by curling the three middle fingers and extending you thumb and smallest finger while shaking your hand back and forth for emphasis physical touch has not always been deemed so critical during the first half of the ht century many psychologists believed that showing affection to children was simply a sentimental gesture that served no real purpose even cautioning that displays of affection risked spreading diseases and contributing to adult psychological problems in her book don t look don t touch behavioral scientist val Curtis of the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine says that one possible reason that handshakes and kisses on cheeks endure as greetings is because they signal that the other person is trusted enough to risk sharing germs with hence the history of the practices going in and out of style depending on public health concerns in the s articles appeared in the American journal of nursing that warned of hands being the agents of bacterial transfer and recommending that Americans adapt the Chinese custom at the time of shaking one s own hands together when greeting a friend there have been more recent objections to handshakes that per date the corona virus outbreak in a UCLA hospital established a handshake free zone in its intensive care unit the UCLA policy only lasted six months meanwhile many Muslim women throughout the world have objected to handshakes based on religious grounds but despite such reservations and incidences of conscientious objectors to handshakes as the ht century progressed the gesture evolved into a near universal and unassailable symbol of professional greeting scientific studies of the ritual have identified how a good handshake activates the same part of the brain that processes other types of reward stimulus such as good food drink and even sex as some states in the us begin to ease lock down measures the future of the handshake remains uncertain i don t think we should ever shake hands ever again to be honest with you rd Anthony faucet a key member of the white house corona virus task force said back in April not only would it be good to prevent corona virus disease it probably would decrease instances of influenza dramatically in this country social distancing guidelines will likely stay in place for a long time to come according to us government s guidelines for re opening the country especially for vulnerable people like the elderly and those with medical co morbidity such as lung disease obesity and diabetes this could give rise to what Stuart wolf associate chair for clinical integration and operations at dell medical calls a science fiction dystopia where society would be divided into those who can touch and be touched and those who must remain isolated that could create grave psychological consequences rd wolf says we already place such a premium on youth and vigor in society and this forced artificial distinction between the old and infirm and the young and healthy probably will hit some folks very hard the urge to reach out physically is deeply wired into us there s a reason why a us president is estimated to shake hands with people per year habits die hard says leek Weber a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton university who studies how people take risks on the other hand habits and social customs can and do change when the social and economic and in this case health context changes think of foot binding in china which was also an ancient custom there are already lots of non contact options bowing for example is already very widely practiced around the world and has been credited for fewer deaths due to corona virus in Thailand then there is waving nodding smiling and myriad hand signals that don t involve physical contact but prof regale notes that one of oviduct s cruel ironies is that it is precisely when humans are faced with stressful circumstances that they depend on human touch think of the ways we respond when people are grieving after death or something bad that s happened it is with a hug or it could just be sitting beside a person and touching a shoulder sanitary conventions like fist bumps and elbow taps just don t quite cut the mustard when it comes to human connectivity whenever they occur there is always an internalized complicit knowledge of how they go against the grain of intuitive friendliness notes Steven pinker Harvard university s john stone family professor of psychology in an article for the Harvard gazette the university s official news website that e tongue sticking out liens why at least in my e tongue sticking out experience people accompany these gestures with a little laugh as if to reassure each other that the superficially aggressive displays are new conventions in a contagious time and offered in a spirit of camaraderie prof pinker says due to her work in public health including infectious diseases delineate Garcia was already moving away from handshakes with most people but some habits are harder to break than others i am a fanatical huger says ms Garcia noting social distancing with her year old mother has been particularly hard she is so close and i just want to walk up to her and smooch her little face and give her a kiss and tell her i love her this powerful urge collides with concerns about transmission resulting in an awkward dance between the two of them she says even as she is approaching i can feel myself growing anxious what if i make her sick ms Garcia says so i withdraw but if she starts to move away i follow i need the tactile to assure myself and yet i can t let her get close we sort of repel one another like identical poles on magnets as hard as a future without handshakes or touch may be it is better than the alternative prof Weber says i don t think people are overreacting at this point quite the opposite survival or trying to stay alive is another important basic human drive the alternative is to go back to life as we knew it and ignore the fact that large numbers of elderly overweight and people with co morbidity will die until we establish herd immunity which will take considerable time but don t give up on the humble handshake just yet while avoiding disease is an essential part of human survival so is living fulfilling and complex social lives says Arthur marksman a professor in the department of psychology at the university of taxes at Austin perhaps we start by focusing on more routine hand washing hand sanitizers and strategies to avoid touching your face rather than giving up touch altogether he says the real concern is that we will develop a new normal that is devoid of touch and so we will not realist what we are missing by not having any tactile contact with the people in our social network

despite finding evidence British troops committed war crimes in Iraq a page report says hundreds of Iraqi detainees were abused by British soldiers between and but the ICC could not determine whether the UK had acted to shield soldiers from prosecution the mod said the ICC report vindicates our efforts to pursue justice where allegations have been founded the ICC told the BBC it is without dispute there is evidence war crimes were committed its report said there was a reasonable basis to conclude that at least seven Iraqis were illegally killed while in British custody between April and September the ICC report refers to evidence of a pattern of war crimes carried out across a number of years by soldiers from several British regiments some detainees were raped or subjected to sexual violence others were beaten so badly they died from their injuries the Iraqi individuals many of them civilians were unarmed and in British custody at the time the UK government has repeatedly accused human rights lawyers of bringing vexatious claims but the ICC says it is disingenuous to describe the entire body of claims involving hundreds of claimants as baseless or spurious a BBC panorama investigation last year revealed that British detectives had also found credible evidence of war crimes committed in Iraq but the programmer discovered that despite this not one of the cases was taken forward by the army s prosecution service the ICC said it took panorama s findings very seriously and that on the whole the information it received was consistent with the reports in the programmer it could not rule out that there had been a cover up on the part of the British authorities its report concluded that investigations by the royal military police had been inadequate and were marred by a lack of independence and impartiality however it could not make a determination as to whether the UK had acted to shield soldiers from prosecution the ICC said it will reopen its examination of the UK s conduct in Iraq should new facts or evidence come to light the UK government is currently seeking to introduce a controversial new law which will make it harder to prosecute British soldiers it says the overseas operations service personnel and veterans bill if passed delivers on the government s manifesto commitment to tackle vexatious claims and end the cycle of re investigations against our brave armed forces after scrutinizing the proposed legislation parliament s joint human rights committee has said we found that the real problem is that investigations into incidents have been inadequate insufficiently resourced insufficiently independent and not done in a timely manner the government is effectively using the existence of inadequate investigations as a reason to legislate to bring in further barriers to bringing prosecutions or to providing justice for victims there is a palpable sense of relief inside the ministry of defense that the international criminal court will not be pursuing a case against the UK government over allegations that British forces in Iraq committed serious war crimes against Iraqi detainees that said there s still the potential that the ICC report will cause the government problems the publication comes as the government tries to pass new legislation aimed at protecting troops from what it calls vexatious claims by lawyers against British troops over allegations of abuse among the proposals of the overseas operations bill is a presumption against prosecution five years after any alleged abuse unless there s compelling new evidence the legislation which has already passed its first stages in the commons has been widely criticized by opposition parties human rights groups lawyers and some former senior military commanders the ICC report also raises concerns about the legislation the ministry of defense says the ICC has brought no new evidence to light but the ICC prosecutor says the fact the allegations investigated by the UK did not result in prosecutions does not mean that these claims were vexatious those words will be seized upon by the bill s critics one of the investigations by the royal military police featured in last year s panorama was into the death of radii mama in British custody the royal military police concluded he had died of a heart attack even though his body and face showed signs he had been beaten to date no one has been prosecuted in connection with radii mama s death his daughter afar radii mama told panorama i saw torture signs on his body they covered his head and tied his hands he could not defend himself and they killed him it is my wish to see the soldiers who committed this crime put on trial and facing justice if i was a British citizen my rights would be respected but because i am an Iraqi citizen it seems i have no rights defense secretary Ben Wallace said the ICC review confirms that the UK is willing and able to investigate and prosecute claims of wrongdoing by armed forces personnel he said it had brought to light no new evidence and the ICC statement vindicates our efforts to pursue justice where allegations have been founded i am pleased that work we have done and continue to do in improving the quality and assurances around investigations has been recognized by the ICC he said the service justice system review and the appointment of sir Richard enriches to provide assurance of our investigative processes are all steps towards making sure we have one of the best service justice systems in the world"

"629","https://www.bbc.com/news/world-11108059",NA,NA,NA,NA,"genocide is understood by most to be the gravest crime against humanity it is defined as a mass extermination of a particular group of people exemplified by the efforts of the Nazis to eradicate the Jewish population in the s but behind that simple definition is a complicated tangle of legal concepts concerning what constitutes genocide and when the term can be applied the term genocide was coined in by the Jewish polish lawyer Raphael lemming who combined the Greek word gens race or tribe with the Latin word iced to kill after witnessing the horrors of the holocaust in which every member of his family except his brother was killed rd lemming campaigned to have genocide recognized as a crime under international law his efforts gave way to the adoption of the united nations genocide convention external in December which came into effect in January article two of the convention defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnic racial or religious group as such killing members of the group causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group forcibly transferring children of the group to another group the convention also imposes a general duty on states that are signatories to prevent and to punish genocide since its adoption the UN treaty has come under criticism from different sides mostly by people frustrated with the difficulty of applying it to specific cases some have argued that the definition is too narrow others that it is devalued by overuse some analysts say the definition of genocide is so narrow that none of the mass killings perpetrated since the treaty s adoption would fall under it the objections most frequently raised against the treaty include the convention excludes targeted political and social groups the definition is limited to direct acts against people and excludes acts against the environment which sustains them or their cultural distinctiveness proving intention beyond reasonable doubt is extremely difficult UN member states are hesitant to single out other members or intervene as was the case in Rwanda there is no body of international law to clarify the parameters of the convention though this is changing as UN war crimes tribunals issue indictments the difficulty of defining or measuring in part and establishing how many deaths equal genocide but in spite of these criticisms there are many who say genocide is recognizable in his book Rwanda and genocide in the ht century the former secretary general of medicines sans frontiers ms alien destitute wrote genocide is distinguishable from all other crimes by the motivation behind it genocide is a crime on a different scale to all other crimes against humanity and implies an intention to completely exterminate the chosen group genocide is therefore both the gravest and greatest of the crimes

victim hood slavery for example is called genocide when whatever it was and it was an infamy it was a system to e tongue sticking out toil rather than to exterminate the living rm indignation said in a lecture the differences over how genocide should be defined have also led to disagreements on how many genocides occurred during the ht century some say there was only one genocide in the last century the holocaust others say there have been at least three genocides as defined by the terms of the UN convention the mass killing of Armenians by ottoman Turks between an accusation that the Turks deny the holocaust during which more than six million Jews were killed Rwanda where an estimated tuttis and moderate huts died in the genocide and in recent years other cases have been added to

of Ukraine the Indonesian invasion of east Timor and the Khmer rouge killings in Cambodia in the s during which an estimated million Cambodians died by execution starvation or forced labor there is

mandrels schlemiel the coed s education director said there were positive signals from the UK s results for the tests taken in which he said showed modest improvements the UK s math results represent a particular improvement on three years ago according to an analysis by the national foundation for educational research fer but it says there has been no significant change for reading or science with scores remaining broadly similar in Pisa tests since despite fluctuations in rankings this year s science score has shown a slight fall in fact but because other countries results have also slipped the UK has climbed upwards in the rankings at the current rate of progress rm schlemiel said it would take a very long time for the UK to catch up with the highest achieving countries he suggested more investment in teachers skills as a way to make improvements the global trend shows Asian school systems such as china and Singapore getting the best results with Estonia and Finland

offering a different perspective from national exams the rankings are based on samples of pupils in each country with about pupils having taken this round of tests the UK s figures are based on a sample of about pupils taking tests in almost schools pupils in England have continued to perform well in reading and science and have made significant improvement in math said Carole Willis chief executive of the fer which published an official analysis of the UK results but she called for more investigation into why pupils in England were more likely to have negative feelings takeoff Barton

year the international monetary fund has warned it is predicting UK growth will fall to just in much lower than its forecast in April of the global economy has shrunk for the first time since the IMF said hit by the Ukraine war and oviduct with growth stalling in the UK us china and Europe the world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession it said we know that people are feeling the impact of rising prices caused by global economic factors triggered by the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine a HM treasury spokesperson said in a statement adding that help for households included off energy bills plus personal tax cuts worth up to a year the IMF has cut its global growth forecast to just and warned the slowdown risks being even more severe it said fast rising prices were to blame for much of the slowdown with households and businesses squeezed by a combination of higher prices and higher borrowing costs as policymakers raise interest rates to try to counter inflation the global economy still reeling from the pandemic and Russia s invasion of Ukraine is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook economist Pierre Olivier outpourings wrote in a blog outlining the international lending body s latest economic forecast the outlook has darkened significantly since April the last time the IMF issued forecasts he added the global economy contracted in the three months to July which was the first decline since the pandemic hit the IMF said the probability of a recession in the g economies Canada France Germany Italy japan the us and UK now stands at roughly nearly four times higher than usual while UK growth is e tongue sticking out acted to remain relatively strong this year rm outpourings said unusually high inflation faster than in Europe or the us is e tongue sticking out acted to take a toll in if you were to look at both years together it s actually not very far from where the other advanced economies are he told the BBC the one thing that worries me more about the UK economy is that their inflation numbers seem to be quite high there is a fairly high pass through from high gas prices to broader prices in the economy that would signal even further monetary policy tightening by the bank of England and that would also weigh down on growth going forward the IMF now e tongue sticking out sects inflation to reach in advanced economies and in emerging market and developing economies nearly a full percentage point higher than it e tongue sticking out acted in April inflation at current levels represents a clear risk for current and future macroeconomic stability and bringing it back to central bank targets should be the top priority for policymakers rm outpourings said tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship the fallout from the war in Ukraine is being felt in pockets across the world soaring food and fuel prices and higher interest rates means the IMF sees more gloomy prospects for all major economies but it s the UK that Russia apart remains bottom of the pile for Brexit may not have helped but it s our reliance on fossil fuels they make up of our energy mix more than in the EU that s made us particularly vulnerable to this shock those prices are determined on international markets but affect us all this report comes on the day that with the energy price cap set to top in October a committee of mos warns that further government help for households may be needed but the IMF is among those economists who be noted that the UK faces more fundamental issues than the current crisis with living standards having dropped behind many competitors over the last years something many attribute to a lack of investment in skills equipment and infrastructure officials from the IMF have previously told me that one way to remedy that would be to raise not lower taxes to fund more investment the us saw the steepest downgrade of any country for the IMF cut its growth forecast for the world s largest economy to this year from previously and to just in meanwhile growth in china is e tongue sticking out acted to fall to this year the slowest rate in nearly four decades as the country wrestles with new oviduct lock downs and a property crisis questions about the reliability of Europe s natural gas supplies from Russia as well as political unrest generated by high food and fuel prices are among the risks the global economy is facing in the months ahead the IMF said we can be reasonably hopeful that china might be rebound rm outpourings said adding that he was much more concerned about both the inflation path and the tightening of monetary policy leading to a slowdown going ahead it warned that in a plausible scenario in which only some of those risks materialist like a shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe global economic growth could fall to next year a pace the world has fallen below just five times since"

during last month s fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza strip amnesty international says a report by the human rights group concludes that Israeli forces conducted apparently disproportionate air strikes which killed Palestinian civilians it also says indiscriminate Palestinian Islamic jihad pi rocket fire killed both Israeli and Palestinian civilians amnesty is calling on the international criminal court to investigate the Israel defense forces id said it operated in accordance with its obligations under international law and made efforts to minimize harm to civilians that were not required by law a spokesman for pi said the group welcomed amnesty s report thirty four Palestinians and one Israeli were killed in the latest round of cross border fighting which erupted on may and ended five days later with an Egyptian brokered ceasefire it began when Israeli warplanes carried out overnight air strikes that killed three senior commanders of pi s military wing in their homes as well as civilians including relatives and neighbors of the men amnesty international said the dropping of precision guided bombs on densely populated areas when families were sleeping suggested that those who planned and authorized the attacks anticipated and likely disregarded the disproportionate harm to civilians intentionally launching disproportionate attacks is a war crime it warned the id said that during the fighting which followed its aircraft struck more than military targets belonging to pi and killed three other senior commanders of its military wing which it blamed for the firing of dozens of rockets and mortars at Israel the previous week amnesty investigated nine strikes including those that targeted the three pi commanders in their homes the id said it made numerous efforts to minimize harm to the civilian population in the Gaza strip including by delaying and even canceling planned attacks when rune tongue sticking out acted presence of civilians was identified the id carried out attacks only after a real time assessment before the attack that the e tongue sticking out acted collateral damage to civilians and civilian property will not be excessive in relation to the military advantage anticipated in the attack according to the information it had in the circumstances it added amnesty also said it identified a pattern of extensive destruction of property in Gaza as a result of the Israeli strikes that failed to meet the exceptions under which attacking homes and other civilian objects would be justified it cited the targeting on may of a four store building in the jambalaya refugee camp that was home to people from the extended nabob family amnesty found no evidence that the building had been used to store weapons or any other military equipment or that rockets had been launched nearby in our investigation we heard vivid accounts of bombs obliterating homes of fathers digging their little girls out from under rubble of a teenager fatally injured as she lay in bed holding a teddy bear said amnesty s middle east director Sheba moray more frightening than any of this is the near certainty that unless perpetrators are held to account these horrifying scenes will be repeated the id said Islamic jihad locates its operational centers in civilian residential buildings and uses the civilian population as a human shield several hours prior to strikes the id ensured that the buildings were evacuated from civilians by various means such as telephone calls and the roof knocking procedure these buildings were not attacked until they were fully evacuated of civilian population pi responded to the Israeli strikes by firing more than rockets towards Israel forcing tens of thousands of civilians to take cover in bomb shelters the id says crossed into Israeli territory in total and that about headed for populated areas were intercepted by its missile defense systems an Israeli woman and a Palestinian laborer from Gaza were killed by rockets that hit an apartment in overshoot and a building site in shakedown respectively amnesty says rockets that fell short in Gaza also appear to have killed three Palestinian civilians including two children the report cites relatives of the children as saying they died when a rocket hit AL sabbath street in Gaza city on the afternoon of may pi denied at the time that a rocket hit the area and blamed Israeli strikes but witnesses told a researcher that individuals associated with the group removed remnants of a rocket in the immediate aftermath of the incident known for their inherent inaccuracy rocket attacks by Palestinian armed groups are indiscriminate these attacks must be investigated as war crimes and victims be granted prompt and adequate redress ms moray said pi spokesman tariff salami did not comment on that allegation but he told the BBC that amnesty s report proves that the occupation Israel was the one that

season is one of the few times they have to get up close and personal with the public as they try to persuade people to vote them into office but the global pandemic has turned everything on its head national elections included political rallies held online socially distanced door knocking sessions and fist bumps instead of handshakes would have been unthinkable a few months ago yet this is what politicians in Singapore are having to contend with as the country gears up for its general election on July the election next Friday takes place as Singapore records more than cases of the corona virus most of which stem from outbreaks in dormitories housing migrant manual laborers a partial lock down was eased earlier this month but social distancing rules are still in place people are called to stay at least m apart and mass gatherings have been banned so how do you campaign amid a pandemic rallies are the lifeblood of election campaigns they re one of the main ways candidates are able to get their message out to the masses the progress Singapore party pap which was founded last year is among opposition parties hoping to make gains this year it s a tall order to take on the people s action party pap which has ruled Singapore since independence in one pap member said the decision not to hold physical rallies this year would greatly hurt its chances and said calling an election in the midst of a pandemic was being done at risk to people the opposition rallies were always a very strong selling point they are very well attended and there s lots of atmosphere that gets generated in it lee shine yang told the BBC during a walkabout to run this election and to forbid any rallies to be held disadvantages the opposition said rm lee who happens to be the brother of lee shine lung Singapore s prime minister and head of the pap in one opposition rally drew an estimated crowd of a sizable number in the country of five million an mp from the pap however said the fact that the election was so heavily reliant on online platforms and social media would actually help to balance things out as the incumbent we be been walking the ground all these years a lot of our networks are actually through our face to face engagement senior minister of state see Hong tat who is running as a candidate in the upcoming elections told the BBC taking away these physical opportunities and using social media i think actually gives the opposition more opportunities to reach voters so it does level the playing field on this front but politics aside there are a whole other range of difficulties that the lack of physical rallies brings in a physical rally someone travels from his house to a venue and once he gets there he typically devotes around an hour of time to listen to what you have to say said rm tan a pap member who has been involved in setting up the group s online presence in a physical rally you can plan your speech you know what your intro will be your middle and how to end but in a virtual rally you re more likely to have seconds to capture someone s interest he told the BBC and even if you do capture their initial interest you be got to be able to maintain it you probably have five parties doing an online rally at around the same time it s like channel surfing so the challenge is how to engage and connect with the audience rm tan said another hurdle is getting through to groups who might not be used to going online elderly people who may be less tech savvy for example you can produce all the content you want but the difficulty is getting it to reach the correct people if you re not a politically inclined person these ads may not pop up on your Facebook said rm tan the group s plan to combat this is to print out fliers directing people to their online presence we distribute fliers directing people to our Facebook page and our meet up sessions via zoom said rm tan we did a survey later and found about of people found out about our zoom session through the flier so it s a hybrid mixing the traditional with the modern methods is the way to go but that does t mean the traditional methods have faded away completely candidates are still walking the ground and knocking on doors but are having to do so in smaller groups and at a distance on door knocking visits we observe social distancing our team is not more than five people and we want to keep the interactions with residents quite brief so we don t have prolonged contact said pap candidate rm see we are still carrying our visits because online is not a perfect substitute for face to face interactions especially for many of our seniors who may not be familiar with it it s certainly not perfect but candidates running have little choice but to make the best of their circumstances as a voter your contact point the candidate is now limited to a few seconds not being able to shake hands that s not a big issue but rather the lack of visual recognition said rm tan when you see someone in a mask you might not have visual recognition or you can t remember exactly which candidate it was this is definitely not the preferred way of campaigning but at the end of the day safety has to come first"

or three months before the hajj annual pilgrimage me and the drivers make enough money to last for the rest of the year but now nothing one of his drivers samurai Brahman part of Saudi Arabia s largely foreign private workers sends the office status updates from the roads around the popular mecca clock tower the sea of pilgrims is missing they usually line the streets dressed in white with umbrellas to protect themselves from the intense heat today the drivers people carriers are void of passengers and the city looks like a ghost town sajjad s drivers send him videos of the pigeons

nothing i have savings which we are spending but i have a lot of staff more than people were working with me and they are suffering one of my friends called me yesterday saying please i need some work i don t even care how much you want to pay me believe me the people are crying there are severe restrictions in place for this year s hajj Saudi Arabia has seen one of the biggest outbreaks of corona virus in the middle east and has said the two million pilgrims who normally come from around the world to mecca will not be allowed to do so in a bid to limit the spread of oviduct only those already living in the country will be allowed to perform the hajj taking the number down to just pilgrims will not be able to freely drink from the holy well of zamzam the water will all have to be bottled individually and when it comes to the stoning of the three pillars in min symbolizing the rejection of the devil the pebbles will have to be sterilized away from Saudi Arabia itself the huge influx of hungry pilgrims usually leads to lucrative import orders for livestock from neighboring countries like Kenya many of whose farmers now have herds of unsold cattle the livestock sub sector in Kenya is big it s the mainstay for most of the households in the country and a way of life for most farmers especially during the hajj period says Patrick manikin from the Kenya livestock producers association on average his members e tongue sticking out rot head of cattle to Saudi Arabia for the hajj he says farmers are now diversifying in to cold storage and local markets we are concerned that it could decimate local cattle prices because all that extra produce could be dumped at cut price to local buyers for a quick sell hajj dates back to the life of the prophet Muhammad years ago and there have been few limitations like this in its history making the pilgrimage at least once is one of the five pillars of Islam the five obligations that every Muslim who is in good health and can afford it must satisfy in order to live a good and responsible life according to Islam pilgrims gather in mecca to stand before the structure known as the Kaaba praising Allah god together they perform other acts of worship too renewing their sense of purpose in the world the shock of a sudden withdrawal of an age old source of income is also leaving many tour companies struggling last year Pakistan sent the most foreign pilgrims to Saudi Arabia but today in Karachi shahs hajj says his firm cheap hajj and um rah deals is on the brink of collapse basically business is zero even other travel related activities were t going on like flights logistics deliveries so there was nothing to sell we were not frankly totally prepared for this we had to downsize our staff to minimal numbers time has now forced us to sell our assets cars and some property to just get through this stage at least i help out some of my team with emergency funds but that s all i can offer for now restrictions this year are putting a large financial hole in the cities of mecca and median which receive billions of dollars worth of business from the traveling pilgrims although most of the cost to the Saudi government of hosting the hajj will be saved this year mecca and median will lose out on around the b b b b worth of business says maze AL daiquiri head of research at the financial services firm AL rajah capital in Riyadh rm AL daiquiri says the government has stepped in to help maybe the small and medium enterprises were suffering but the Saudi central bank is trying to support this segment to give them relief by deferring their loans for a further two or three months we believe that we are facing a recovery period we think the worst is behind us more than of Saudi Arabia s national income comes from oil but prices have plummeted forcing the country to diversify yet things haven t been going so well according to Alexander peeress of moody s sovereign risk group the government announced in march it would postpone collection of various government fees as well as value added tax for three months but this is not going to avert a recession in the non oil sector of the economy we think it will contract by about he says in mecca despite the empty bookings screen in front of him sajjad manlike does not want to return to his native Pakistan Saudi Arabia has served as an economic last

"679","https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49948381",NA,NA,NA,NA,"three and a half years ago Lyndon dykes was working eight hours a day in a factory pressing badges and numbers onto sports kits back in his native Australia a talented young footballer with a less than professional attitude he took a risk by moving to Scotland to try to make a living from the sport which was not even his favorite as a boy now a key cog in a Livingston side that continues to defy e tongue sticking out expectations in the Scottish premiership the year old talks to BBC Scotland about how a bout of paralysis playing rugby league helped shape his game lectures on shooting from Stephen dobbin and his international hopes dykes route to the Scottish top flight was a circuitous one indeed his route into football was far from straightforward a precocious rugby league talent who was in the sights of the national rugby league side Canberra raiders in his youth dykes also played basketball and a bit of Aussie rules football before his uncle himself a former footballer introduced him to the round ball game after moving back to the gold coast a trip with the Australian schoolboys side to face England allowed him to visit family in dummies where both his parents are from and through a connection he earned a spot in the queen of the south under side playing times in before returning to Australia for two years it was at this point that dykes stopped considering football as a hobby stopped stuffing about and started viewing it as an escape route from the factory work friends coaches school teachers would try and give me a kick up the a and say i can become something and make a living out of it he recalls i awns t committed i was too comfortable enjoying myself and it just switched one day and i thought i need to put my head down and just try here the results have been pretty impressive a return to dummies in brought first team football at queens and after initially playing as a left winger dykes grew into a pivotal figure at Palmerston playing just off the prolific dobbin acting as the unselfish foil while dobbin hit an incredible goals in games last term dykes learned a lot from his strike partner while also delivering goals and assists himself dykes summer departure for Livingston will not be the only factor but dobbin has yet to score a league goal this term with only three so far in all competitions i helped him out and he helped me out dykes says we knew where each other was going straight away we had a connection he s even better when you see him every day and think how s that gone in he used to get angry with me if i tried to lace the ball hard he was always saying just place it in the corners side foot it accesses come from behind to beat Livingston premiership team news stats dykes has made a similar impact in his short spell at Livingston with four goals two assists and a new contract one month into his spell in west clothing but much like the club he plays for he has often been labeled as one dimensional and physical although he believes he brings more than just strength dykes does t shy away from the label indeed a tale from his days playing rugby league suggests he s always relished a battle playing at full back he scythed down some big boy who rampaged past all of his team mates and landed on him in the process later that night he woke up unable to move he had to shout for his dad who took him to hospital but luckily he recovered he laughs as he considers what his rugby upbringing has added to his football it helps me when i was younger i loved to be full back and tackling big boys and stuff so i just had that fearless attitude getting roughed up i bring other things to my game too i m quite intelligent but rugby league helped with the physical side when you look at some of the defenders they re a lot bigger than me but i think they re not e tongue sticking out eating my determination to get the ball that helps me a lot dykes describes Livingston as the perfect fit for him both are robust and hard working with a reputation for physicality but with underrated finer qualities Livingston just have that image now if we see the ball there we re going to go and win it dykes says when i got sent off at fibroid i did t think it was a sending off i m not going up to try and header the ball to injure someone i m just jumping and looking at the ball other teams do it to us but we just get on with it unless it s bad his ambition too is admirable given where he started just a few years ago a bigger club and an international call up are on his wish list and though he s eligible for Scotland through his parents his preference is for Australia but only just Dundee united striker Lawrence shank land s recent Scotland call despite playing in the championship may just have made his international ambitions feel a bit more realistic if i went into any team i think i could adapt to what they needed dykes says shank land deserves to be called up you can t fault his goal scoring i played against him when he was at aye he was great the whole season so i hope he does well and maybe we might play with each other one day for

in the UK dedicated to lord anathema has opened thanks to efforts by devotees it has been set up at the former culvert school in rush hill bath by sheer jagannatha temple UK group and the bath Hindu community bath Hindu community member hashish astrakhan said for us it s like a dream of a lifetime that s come true having a temple in bath lord anathema is celebrated with an annual festival in the summer we had this dream for a long time about to years but it could t have been possible without the help of sheer jagannatha temple UK said rm astrakhan who lives in the city lord anathema is considered to be an incarnation of the second god in the Hindu triumvirate lord Vishnu the preserver and protector of the universe he is celebrated in the anathema rat rattrap or chariot festival held in June or July devotees pull an idol of lord anathema and his elder brother balladry and sister subhead along on a colorful decorated chariot through the streets in India the main lord anathema temple is in puree modish and dates back to the ht century where the chariot festival normally draws in thousands of people founder member of sheer jagannatha temple UK prat rusty from bury st redounds Suffolk said the anathema culture has a massive following in India in the united kingdom there are lots of Hindu temples and usually what happens in Hinduism is we have multiple gods and their different followers that s how Hinduism is so a group of friends devotees we traveled to some of the UK temples and found there awns t a temple dedicated to anathema anathema was there as a side deity so there were t any proper anathema ceremonies or anathema puma ceremony so that s where the idea came in there are so many devotees around the country in the UK and Europe who love and follow lord anathema so we wanted to try and form a temple in his name there are thought to be about Hindus who live in the bath area and both groups bath Hindu group and sheer anathema temple UK have also connected with and won further support from the bath interfaith group rm char from biggleswade in stewardship is one of the nine founding members of the sheer jagannatha temple UK which has or so members he said that devotees made the pledge to set up the temple during last year s chariot festival it happened swiftly because we received unconditional support from the bath Hindu community who had been trying to establish a Hindu temple in bath for the past years he said now we can attract donors and members which can help the sustainability of the temple and help build a strategic temple in bath in the longer term the group intends to buy land in bath for a permanent temple site and will keep fundraising towards that goal in the meantime as a result no target amount has yet been set but fundraising efforts have started for the new temple build and organizers hope to raise more awareness during this year s chariot festival due to be held on or as close to July depending on oviduct regulations founding member sustain pas from basing stoke Hampshire said lord anathema is also the lord of arts and culture there are eight classical forms of dance in India dissing is one of the oldest and it is very closely connected with lord anathema and the chukka position which actually means salutation to the lord dance is an integral part of the anathema culture it s not on the side in a little room it s in the main temple so when the actual temple is constructed in a couple of years time my role is to ensure the dance arena is there ms pas also hopes to build on her existing work running workshops for schools and organizing trips to Hindu temples for more children to learn about the anathema culture the temple based at the former culvert school site opened on may as the oviduct crisis unfolded in India consultant at the royal united hospital rd shariah hangar said my parents and most of my family live abroad in India so we be not been able to visit them and have felt isolated i have been lucky enough to go to work every day but there have been a lot of people tied inside their house not being able to go outside apart from exercise working from home with the stress of having children at home we re all sitting in a pressure cooker we all need a point of release a place of spirituality a community center we need it and it s come at the right time it s made a huge difference i can see people being engaged it s not just a temple it s a place where you can discuss issues that are going on with your close friends and family and find solutions and find that inner peace he said the temple would also help to bring the community together offering a space where people could practice yoga dance and the arts in India anathema temples also see Muslims being made welcome there rm rusty from the sheer jagannatha temple UK said i grew up in India i m used to going with different faiths and celebrating with them so i go to a church or temple if i have to so that

Kelly tells the BBC how he managed to live for a year on the international space station and why four years into his retirement from NASA he would go back if someone asked it s July and all three occupants of the international space station are squeezing into the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that acts as their lifeboat in the event of an emergency the crew members have been told by mission control that a large defunct satellite is hurtling their way at km per second controllers know it will come close but they can t track the object precisely enough to know if it will skim by or score a devastating bullseye us astronaut Scott Kelly and Russians genned padlock and Mikhail mishap kornienko hunker down in the cramped capsule waiting for the speeding hunk of metal to close in following the procedures drawn up for such an eventuality by preparing to detach from the station at a moment s notice and return to earth it s hardly the first time captain Kelly a former military pilot has been in a life threatening situation but the e tongue sticking out experience caused him to ponder their collective powerlessness had the satellite hit there would have been no time to get away mishap genned and i would have gone from grumbling to one another in our cold Soyuz to being blasted in a million directions as diffused atoms all in the space of a millisecond he recalls in his memoir endurance crew rotations on the ISS come with many of the mundane features of everyday life on earth video calls cleaning and bad days at work but every now and then as on this occasion astronauts get a stark reminder of the hostile environment beyond the comforting walls of their vessel since Kelly has made three separate visits to the orbiting outpost but it was on his last flight between and that he gained worldwide recognition along with mishap kornienko he was tasked with spending a whole year on the space station twice the length of a regular stay in doing so he smashed the previous long duration spaceflight record for an American set by astronaut Michael l<c3><b3>pez alegr<c3><ad>a by more than days but Kelly is just as well known for having an identical twin brother mark who was also a NASA astronaut mark who is older by about six minutes was elected as a senator for the state of Arizona in the us election speaking to me by video call from his home in Colorado Scott Kelly says there was never a moment he felt like coming home early my goal was always to get to the end of the flight with as much energy and enthusiasm as i had at the beginning and i think i did that i could have stayed up there longer if there had been a good reason so i never really doubted my ability to do that despite the fact that astronauts and cosmonauts are screened for their psychological ability to cope he says i know that other people have had hard times with it i be seen that myself in person some folks having a challenge being isolated like that it s hard but it s not so hard you can t do it he e tongue sticking out liens i don t know if it s necessarily an introvert extrovert thing but you definitely have to be comfortable being your own entertainment adding it s not for everybody the toughest things he says are not being able to go outside and e tongue sticking out experience nature as well as the formidable daily schedule of space station tasks another challenge he says was sharing a relatively small place with the same people for so long even though all those people are great it was a challenge successfully navigated however as the close quarters confinement helped forge long standing friendships i was just exchanging emails with NASA s jell linden my wife and i did a video conference the other day with Italian European space agency astronaut Samantha aristocratic i talk to mishap kornienko and genned padlock he e tongue sticking out liens the us is committed to four more years of funding for the ISS but uncertainties remain about support for the orbiting lab after that the space station was born in the s during an era of political d<c3><a9>tente between the us and Russia the space station programmer has been a great example of international co operation in a peaceful way he tells me my e tongue sticking out experience with the cosmonauts on the station has always been one of professionalism of respect reliance on each other my hope is that whenever we do decide to put the space station in the pacific ocean there is something there to replace it for the last years all humans have not been on earth at the same time i would like to see that continue Kelly awns t consumed by work for the whole of his year in orbit he also managed to find time for much needed fun and games in what would become a viral video he chased British astronaut chm peak through part of the space station dressed in a gorilla suit peak it has to be said does a good job of projecting alarm if he is indeed acting the suit vacuum packed and sent up on a supply flight was a birthday present from mark and i ask Scott whether it was some sort of in joke between the brothers my brother said hey i m sending you a gorilla suit and i said why are you sending me a gorilla suit he said why not Kelly says with a wry smile that s about as much thought as was put into that the siblings were raised in suburban new jersey by parents who were both cops their mother was the first female officer in the township of west orange where they grew up and Scott cites the determination she showed as an inspiration in his efforts to become an astronaut mark and Scott showed similar early propensities for risk taking that led to frequent injuries including hospitalizations but there was a point at school where mark surged ahead in his studies while Scott was prone to being easily distracted in class at college it was the party scene competing for Scott s attention he credits a phone conversation with mark who told him to lay off the socializing and knuckle down with turning his academic fortunes around after training as a navy pilot Scott was assigned to a strike squadron called the world famous puking dogs he flew the f tomcat the plane featured in top gun during the s and carried out combat missions during the first gulf war however Kelly was eager to become part of an even more elite group those who have flown the space shuttle following his selection as a NASA astronaut in the class of along with mark Scott served as a pilot on one shuttle mission before commanding another in on the shuttle it s the commander that actually pilots the vehicle and it s on the dazzlingly difficult landing that these skills come into their own i only flew it once it s kind of crazy to consider how much time and effort you put into doing this one piloting task and then you get to do it once or twice says Kelly you be got one chance to land this if you don t it s not like you re adding power and coming around again you recognize not only your colleagues are watching but a large part of the rest of the world the shuttle was a magnificent if flawed vehicle and the world was reminded of the huge risks of space travel when in the space shuttle Columbia broke up while returning to earth killing seven astronauts NASA s safety culture was criticized by investigations in the wake of both the challenger and Columbia disasters Kelly lost friends on Columbia and when i interview him he is preparing to address the virtual safety culture summit alongside Charles sully sullenness who landed a stricken us airways flight on the Hudson river and environmental campaigner rein bronchitic the stuff that we do is so extraordinarily risky he tells me safety has to be everyone s responsibility everyone needs to know that they are empowered to speak up if there s an issue when it was originally proposed that an identical twin would be sent into orbit for a year long stay on the ISS one group of scientists eyed a unique opportunity to study the effects of extended periods in space on the human body by using an earth bound mark as a genetically identical control scientists would have greater confidence that any changes they were seeing in Scott were caused by the space environment both twins were subjected to a battery of tests measuring potential shifts in their physiology cognitive abilities immunity and DNA among other things the results revealed genetic changes that suggested Scott s DNA was repairing itself due to damage from cosmic radiation scientists also saw rune tongue sticking out acted changes in caps on the ends of Scott s chromosomes called milometers as well as shifts in his blood chemistry body mass and gut flora but the vast majority of these reversed themselves once he was back on earth four years on he says i don t have any symptoms of anything that i can definitively point to as caused by that amount of time in space but i do have some structural and physiological changes to my eyes though it does t affect my vision scientists know that some people are affected more by ocular changes in space than others and there has been work on the genetics underlying these differences i ask Kelly if as we learn more about how different people respond to the space environment these biological markers could play a bigger role in astronaut selection perhaps even at the e tongue sticking out ens of more traditional qualities i think that s not just an issue for NASA but our society in general it goes deeply into insurance and per existing conditions whether genetic susceptibility could be considered a per existing condition that is definitely an ethical conversation to be had he says the findings of the twins study were reassuring in light of space agencies plans to send humans on a round trip to the red planet which lies million miles from earth and could take nine months each way but astronauts will be e tongue sticking out odes to around times the radiation dose they would get in earth orbit putting them at long term risk of cancers and other illnesses you ll either have to find a way to shield or get to mars quicker Kelly says the other option is you just accept the risk it s a dilemma you suspect Kelly himself would have considered carefully he retired from NASA in and has since been writing and speaking about his e tongue sticking out experiences with his wife he has since moved from Houston the hub for NASA s human spaceflight programmer to Denver in the four years since he left new opportunities have opened up for travel into space and skillets like his are in demand the astronaut whose long duration spaceflight record Kelly surpassed Michael l<c3><b3>pez alegr<c3><ad>a is now set to return from retirement to command a privately funded flight to the ISS aboard eon musk s crew dragon vehicle despite having achieved so much it s clear that Kelly s fascination with spaceflight remains undiminished if someone asked me hey do you want to fly in space i d say sure absolutely depending on what i d be launching on i would t get into a cannon and launch myself like a cannonball Kelly says it would have to be something that made sense that was safe but i would t rule it out if you know anyone out there who has a rocket ship they need piloting follow Paul on twitter captain Scott Kelly recently participated in the

a day before Nicola benedictine gives her first interviews as director of the Edinburgh international festival there s a slew of gloomy news from the Scottish cultural sector the national galleries of Scotland warn they ll struggle to keep their doors open the CEO of creative Scotland tells the culture committee that many organizations are fighting for survival and before the morning is out the charity which runs the Edinburgh international film festival has called in the administrators it s a challenging time for anyone involved in the arts but Nicola benedictine has arrived in her post as director of the Edinburgh international festival fighting i m acutely aware of the vulnerability of our position and it s heart breaking news about the film festival she says on the other hand it s a time when boldness creativity and imagination are more needed than ever it s people who get us in and out of every wave and our ability to solve problems literally imagine our way out we need to speak to our arts and culture more boldly own that space more fiercely and that s speaking on behalf of the full cultural landscape of Scotland it s something which is a huge responsibility but we have to rise to the challenge her appointment to the post came as something of a surprise not just to the cultural sector but to the award winning violinist herself i remember getting this phone call and thinking i was being asked to recommend someone for the job and it took me a while to realist they were asking me she began to consider what she could bring to the job since winning BBC young musician of the year at the age of she has been performing internationally released albums won a Grammy award and set up her own foundation to promote music education and while she had no formal training in arts administration she realized she had been absorbing it for more than years very quickly ideas that were born when i was some when i was some born in japan some in Scotland came to mind she says whenever i had spoken to audiences those who run orchestras or theaters or concert halls i had been asking questions it was twenty years of touring the world asking those questions she also acknowledges her parents scotch Italians Giovanni and Francesca her father is a retired businessman and entrepreneur having come from a business background with a highly optimistic sometimes unrealistic father and a very realistic sometimes pessimist mother i m always looking at what can be done differently or better she convinced the board at the Edinburgh international festival and in march this year she was announced as the first woman and the first Scot to take up the post she officially took over from Fergus lineman who d held the post since at the start of October but she says work began almost immediately on programmed which can often involve bookings years in advance she likens her role in the organization to that of a performer with an orchestra it s a team effort involving many different people one of the biggest challenges for an orchestra to sound great and do justice to the music is for everyone to understand their strongest function and if you can that you will perform best it s a wonderful way to look at it and for me bringing the public with us on this journey is important regardless of where you re from or what your e tongue sticking out experience is she s immersed herself in the history of the year event and of course she s played her own part in the most recent stage including the pandemic festival which involved scaled down outdoor concerts she says it made her realist the resilience of the festival and the support it had i just recall looking out into that enormous tent and being overwhelmed with emotion it was telling to me that i did t understand how common that emotion was until i started speaking to audiences this year and realized we all e tongue sticking out experienced that emotion that shared emotion is what people do feel what people want to feel and what we want to feel more of her high profile should help both with audiences and with funding partners we ll see i know a lot of people in Scotland i m from here i can speak directly to people i understand the historic and humble position the festival occupies it s also not a stretch to me to understand why someone would t feel welcome or understand the arts i would feel closer to the average person walking into a concert hall feeling there are things they don t know her youth she s may also help the festival attract younger audiences there s an absolute common desire to ask where our future audiences are coming from but it s a total misconception that anywhere at the festival is a closed door i hope we can make that clear in transparent messaging i don t need to go through a process of translation i can speak directly to young people and the festival is committed to that she says she would rather prepare new audiences for the traditional elements of a classical performance than see them changed it s important to maintain the traditional elements of concerts the hall the quiet the attention there s ways of doing that which is neither patronizing a new audience nor diminishing the e tongue sticking out experience for the existing audience all the e tongue sticking out experiences i be had from the stage and from producing events every minutiae from programmed to lighting to tickets i be had that e tongue sticking out experience from a number of different angles and i i be also seen what s way over the top and destroys the intimacy and beauty that collective listening e tongue sticking out experience is a wonderful thing and something you don t get a lot of out there in the chaos of the world so it s a careful balancing act to protect it and make sure it s open to everyone balance seems like the perfect word for a violinist adding a new string to her bow but how much of the musician will we hear at future festivals it s something we will consider year by year but i m going to be playing she says i feel it would be mean and not wise to say i m taking over this role but you re never going to hear me play i will definitely be playing it s just a case of what and when"

have a new category this year in name at least there has been an Oscar for best foreign language film since although the title could vary in the early years but when two years ago producers Larry karaszewski and Diane weatherman took over running the category it did t take long to decide the old title should go karaszewski said last year the word foreign was starting to seem strange because there was really nothing foreign about the movies that we were seeing they were just not in the English language so now academy members are voting to choose the best international feature film the submission rules remain unchanged one film per country with limited amounts of English dialogue but the voting procedure has always been more complex than for most categories and more differences have been instigated the most significant is that shortlisted films can be watched online this allows more academy members to participate in the voting process more than films submitted have come down to a final five here we give an overview of each country Poland language polish Poland s track record in this category eleven previous nominations including one win director Jan korma what s it about denial is a young man living in a tough juvenile detention center where violence is common he s allowed out to travel to a village in the countryside to work in a sawmill the village priest comes to assume denial has just left a catholic seminary and appoints him his unofficial stand in while he goes away it could all be the set up to a comedy of mistaken identity and there is humor in the film but denial played by barnstorm biennial offers the villagers the emotional consolation they needed after a recent tragedy but which never materialized they accept and perhaps even love him though some of them may suspect he s not what he claims to be the violent denial blossoms into something far better but then reality lunges into view chances of winning at the film s center is a remarkable performance by barnstorm biennial working with a strong screenplay based loosely on real events biennial shows denial s hardened viciousness but slowly allows the audience to sense goodness growing inside him perhaps even a soul a man devoid of morality becomes the most moral person in the film it s hard not to care about his fate though the audience guesses his pretense will be discovered eventually though it s not likely to win the careers of biennial and director korma will benefit country north Macedonia language Turkish and Macedonian north Macedonia s track record in this category one nomination as Macedonia in directors Tamara eukaryotes and lobotomize steadfast what s it about it s a documentary focusing on the tough lives of hatted curator who s in her s and her mother finalize in countryside a few miles from the capital Skopje hatted an absolute gift for any documentary maker survives mainly by keeping bees and selling their honey at market a family moves in nearby any initial suspicion is soon replaced by warmth as hatted accepts them almost as her own the bees become a joint project but financial pressures encourage the newly arrived family to over harvest the honey problems emerge chances of winning it s rare a documentary gets nominated in this category the film is also nominated for best documentary feature it was shot over a period of three years by a small crew the result was hours of rushes which have been e tongue sticking out pertly edited down there are a few moments which feel as if they may have been recreated for the camera but overall it s an insight into a life most audiences will know nothing about no documentary has yet won in the category but hatted s personality alone makes the film worth seeing the directors have now bought her a new house country France language french France s track record in this category nominations with wins only Italy has won more often director lad l what s it about abandon thoughts of jean val jean inspector avert and anthems sung on barricades the film takes its title from the victor Hugo novel but it s set in the modern social housing estate of lech bouquets in eastern pairs parts of the book are set around the same area st<c3><a9>phane is a policeman transferred to a unit which patrols the tough neighborhood by car tensions some racial simmer with residents the two officers st<c3><a9>phane is assigned to one white one black have learn to cut corners if they see the need a lion cub is stolen from a circus which at first seems almost comic then a violent incident occurs which the police need to hide but a complication emerges the incident was filmed from a drone chances of winning director lad l is from a Malian immigrant family and grew up in the area where there were big riots in it s his first feature film and it took the jury prize at Cannes last year much of the screenplay works well as a police procedural but it s strange that though he digs into the policemen s characters we re left needing to learn more about individuals in the community at times plot and characterizations don t convince st<c3><a9>phane comes across as improbably naive about colleagues attitudes to policing a tough beat and the background of day to day life for the mainly African families barely registers there s ample tension in the first half but as mayhem kicks off the story loses some of its grip country Spain language Spanish Spain s track record in this category nominations including four wins director Pedro samovar what s it about Salvador mall played by Antonio band eras is a respected Spanish film maker who s financially well off but beginning to feel his age it s not clear he will ever make another film his health is failing and he is increasingly prone to depression and dependence on drugs in extended flashbacks to childhood we see his love for his mother played by Penelope Cruz the first stirrings of gay sexuality and the sparky intelligence which set him apart as a boy struggling to rediscover a creative path mall goes to visit the star of an early hit with whom he fell out many years ago chances of winning samovar now has been nominated twice before in this category and won in for all about my mother he also took an Oscar for his screenplay for talk to her so he s a known quantity with Oscar voters samovar insists pain and glory sin t e tongue sticking out licitly autobiographical but there are clear parallels with his own life the film s attractively shot and designed and the performances are excellent the story s quieter and more considered than many of his early works though sometimes it feels the director is revisiting old ground but if there s one thing academy members love it s a screen full of good looking people lamenting how tough it is to be a film maker country south chorea language Korean with a little English south chorea s track record in this category it s the first south Korean film nominated in this category director bong jun ho what s it about the film is a dark and intricately worked out farce with a strong streak of class based satire and with more violence than farce normally involves the Kim family lives in a crowded semi basement where they just about get by financially a friend suggests the son could make cash filling in for him as tutor to a wealthy but wildly dysfunctional family one by one the existing domestic staff disappear as he schemes to get his entire family employed the skims seem secure financially at last of course fate has other ideas chances of winning parasite took the palm d or at Cannes last year and has just won best film not in the English language at this year s baristas there are many Hollywood executives who since then have wished they d come up with the story thrown it to a us writer and sat back to await the Oscar plaudits as well as best international film it s nominated for best picture best director best screenplay best editing and best production design it s worth buying a ticket just to ogle the gorgeous house for a couple of hours it was built especially on a movie lot many see the film as the most predictable of shoo ins at this year s Oscars some academy members may feel it s wasteful to hand the award to a film likely to win in other categories though last year roam took best foreign language film despite having nine other nominations if parasite does win and after Alfonso macaroon s success last time does that suggest this category is undergoing a fundamental shift toward the mainstream is the era over when an accomplished but little noticed film could come from nowhere to take this Oscar follow us on Facebook or on twitter newsagents if you have a story suggestion email entertainment news BBC co UK"

connection to the church in it s a cathartic piece for people who have ever felt conflict in their lives from a religious perspective we are not great with language in northern Ireland but our self

cultural starvation since the pandemic with this year s festival providing a strong sense of celebration and relief the most badly hit sector in the whole of the arts during lock down was theater as northern Irish theaters were closed for a year and five months i also think because of the Lisa McGee and naan burns effect everyone working in northern Irish theater feels this year that there is a
